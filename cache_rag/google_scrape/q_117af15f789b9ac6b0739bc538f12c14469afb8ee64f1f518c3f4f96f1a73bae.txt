By The Associated Press | The Associated Press UPDATED: April 28, 2016 at 8:03 PM MDT NEW YORK — Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o was looking forward to a break. It’s been a long week for the most decorated football player in the country. Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel seemed to have more energy when he arrived at a midtown Man- hattan hotel with his fellow Heisman Trophy finalist. They spent about 30 minutes getting grilled by dozens of reporters before being whisked away to more media interviews. Manziel, Te’o or Kansas State quarterback Collin Klein, the other finalist — who could not make it to town Friday — each has a chance to be a Heisman first Saturday night. Klein, a Loveland High School graduate, was the front-runner for the Heisman for a good chunk of the season, but he played his worst game late in the season — in K-State’s loss at Baylor — and the momentum Manziel gained by leading Texas A&M to a win at Alabama has been tough to stop. Manziel set a Southeastern Conference record with 4,600 total yards, throwing for more than 3,000 and rushing for more than 1,000. Klein, by comparison, averages about 100 fewer total yards per game (383-281) than Manziel. Klein was in Baltimore on Friday accepting the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award as the nation’s top college QB.
