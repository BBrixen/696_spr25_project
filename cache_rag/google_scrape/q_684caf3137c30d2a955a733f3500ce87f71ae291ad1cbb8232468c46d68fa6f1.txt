Discussion Personally, it was the game that conviced me to get a Nintendo Switch (even though I actually got it one year later after it's release becaues I didn't have a Switch due to how stupidly expensive they were where I live) Recently, I have started to replay it after four years and while I still think that it its pretty good, I noticed there were a couple of problems that I had with the game, such as the structure of unlocking levels, the lack of a hub world, the capture mechanic, the somewhat bland level design, dumbing dumb the controls to promote a local two-player mode that most people don't really care, focusing more on motion controls that causes some moves be worse with a normal control, the overabundance of Power Moons and the tedious challengues required to get them. With the exception of the overabundance of Power Moons and how incredibly tedious the challengues to get them are, the rest of the issues are actually somewhat minor, but when replaying it, I couldn't help but notice them and think the game could have been better. If they ever decide to make a sequel of this game, I hope they addresed all (or at least most) the flaws so the game can take full potential of it's premise. Read more Archived post.
