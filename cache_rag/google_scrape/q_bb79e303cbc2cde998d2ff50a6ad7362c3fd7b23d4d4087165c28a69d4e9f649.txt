Kjotve led the western Norwegian kings against King Harald Fairhair ( Harald Hårfagre ) at the Battle of Hafrsfjord ( Slaget i Hafrsfjorden ). Defeated by Harald, Kjotve fled; many of his allies were killed in the battle. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] His son Thorir Haklang was a berserker who fell during the Battle of Hafrsfjord . Popular culture [ edit ] A character loosely inspired by the historical Kjotve, nicknamed "Kjotve the Cruel", appears in an antagonistic role during the opening hours of the 2020 video game Assassin's Creed Valhalla . Kjotve the Cruel has one son named Gorm, who features periodically throughout the game, and Kjotve is revealed through the mobile game Assassin's Creed: Rebellion to have a second son, Hrolfr. Kjotve appears in Paradox Interactive 's video game Crusader Kings , and its two sequels , ruling the province of Agder. References [ edit ] ^ Claus Krag. "Harald 1 Hårfagre" .
