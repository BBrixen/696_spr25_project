The tournament determined the Big Ten champion up until 2009 when the conference started using the regular season to determine the Big Ten champion. • The Wolverines have reached 19 straight championship matches at the Big Ten Tournament, dating back to the 2004-05 season. Michigan has won five of the last six tournaments contested, picking up a 4-3 win over Northwestern in the final match in 2018, grabbing a 4-1 win over Illinois in 2019, and knocking off Ohio State (4-0 in 2022, 4-2 in 2023, 4-2 in 2024) in the last three editions. The Buckeyes won in 2021, with no tournament held in 2020. • Michigan is the No. 1 seed for the third straight season and will face either No. 8 seed Maryland.
