[ 1 ] The competitions are the Masters Tournament , the PGA Championship , the U.S. Open , and The Open Championship , contested annually. Jack Nicklaus won 18 men's major golf championships, more than any other man. Jack Nicklaus has won the most majors, achieving 18 victories during his career. [ 2 ] Second on the list is Tiger Woods , who has won 15 majors to date; his most recent major victory was at the 2019 Masters . [ 3 ] Walter Hagen is third with 11 majors; [ 4 ] he and Nicklaus have both won the most PGA Championships with five. [ 5 ] Nicklaus also holds the record for the most victories in the Masters, winning the tournament six times. [ 6 ] Additionally, Nicklaus shares the record for the most U.S. Open victories with Willie Anderson , Bobby Jones and Ben Hogan , each winning four times. [ 7 ] Harry Vardon holds the record for the most Open Championship victories, winning six times during his career. [ 8 ] Six men: Nicklaus, Woods, Hogan, Gary Player , Rory McIlroy and Gene Sarazen are the only golfers to have won all four of the majors during their career, [ 9 ] thus achieving the career grand slam . Although the U.S. Amateur and The Amateur Championship were once considered to be majors, [ 10 ] they are no longer recognized as such, and victories in these competitions are not included in the list. To date, 471 majors have been played. A total of 233 different men have won majors and, of these, 89 have won at least two.
