Google CEO Sundar Pichai has told employees that the company will extend its work-from-home order through summer 2021, according to an email sent to employees on Monday and obtained by Business Insider. The memo confirmed an earlier report from The Wall Street Journal , which said Google was considering keeping employees at home until next summer. "To give employees the ability to plan ahead, we'll be extending our global voluntary work from home option through June 30, 2021 for roles that don't need to be in the office," Pichai said in the email. Google had previously told employees they should expect to work remotely for the rest of the year. The latest extension makes Google the first company to set a timeline into next summer. According to The Journal, Pichai planned to extend the timeline into 2021 after a meeting with the company's executive team. This was partly because of the uncertainty around school years, according to the report. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Read the full memo Pichai sent to employees below. Hi everyone, I'm grateful for everything you've been doing to deliver on our mission and be helpful to our users and each other the past few months — I know it hasn't been easy. I'm pleased to say we've made good progress in bringing Googlers back into the office as local conditions have improved in a number of countries. With robust health and safety protocols in place, we've opened offices in 42 countries, and hope to reopen in many more as conditions permit. Please continue to look to your local leaders for updates on your site. In other parts of the world, we haven't reopened more widely. To give employees the ability to plan ahead, we'll be extending our global voluntary work from home option through June 30, 2021 for roles that don't need to be in the office. I hope this will offer the flexibility you need to balance work with taking care of yourselves and your loved ones over the next 12 months. This means that most Googlers can continue working remotely from anywhere within the country of your assigned office through June 2021. If you are currently living in a country other than where your office is located, or are considering a move, please familiarize yourself with the FAQ and expect to hear from local leadership and People Operations. We are still learning a lot from our experiences of working from home and will use that knowledge to inform our approach to the future of work at Google. I look forward to discussing this more with you in the coming weeks. For now, go/coronavirus remains the best place for real-time information about our return to office and work from home approach, and go/cvmentalhealth has wellbeing resources. I know this extended timeline may come with mixed emotions and I want to make sure you're taking care of yourselves. Thanks again for everything you're doing to support our users, our customers, and each other. -Sundar Recommended video Google Alphabet coronavirus Read next Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know HOME Subscribe This story is available exclusively to Business Insider       subscribers.
