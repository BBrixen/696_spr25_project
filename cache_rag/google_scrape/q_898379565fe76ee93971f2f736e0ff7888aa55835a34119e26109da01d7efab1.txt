Members Online • Saxyman76 Ranking Djokovic's Seasons (2006-2020) Big 3 So obviously this is just my opinion, and I'm definitely willing to adjust this list if people with more knowledge on him can discuss his playing level more in depth in these seasons but anyway: I will be looking at all 15 of Djokovic's complete seasons (which excludes 2021, who knows how good this season will turn out to be) from 2006 onwards. This is because including 2003-2005 would be pointless as they were his first seasons in the tour and obviously will be his worst. Also, to show relative strengths, I will give seasons a rating (S, A, B, C, D, F). 15. 2006 - This was Djokovic's first breakthrough season, in which he won 2 ATP titles (both at the 250 level) and finished the year 16th in the world. He also claimed two wins against top 10 players this year. Rating: F 14. 2017 - The injury year. Djokovic performed averagely at the slams making two quarterfinals, and only made a single Masters 1000 final, at Rome. He only claimed 2 ATP titles (yet again both at the 250 level). This season ranks marginally above the 2006 season. Rating: F 13. 2010 - Djokovic had a tough time at the office this year, only making one slam final and failing to make any M1000 finals. However, despite only picking up 2 ATP titles again, they were both at 500 level (so an improvement over 2017). This is a notable stepup from the 2017 season. Rating: D 12. 2009 - Djokovic actually had a slightly worse run in the slams than 2010 (only making 1 SF at USO), however his 1 masters title and 5 masters finals makes up for it.  Additionally, he picked up 5 titles this year (1 M1000, 3 500s and 1 250). He finished the year number 3 again, and beat Federer in the Swiss Open (the first year so far in which he beat the world number 1). Rating : C 11. 2007 - The best season in which Djokovic failed to win a grand slam. He made one final (US Open) and two other semi-finals, meaning that he was proving himself to be the third best player in the game for the first time. Djokovic also won his first two Masters 1000s titles this year, beating a number one ranked player (Roger Federer) for the first time, in the process. In total, Djokovic won 5 titles this year (2 M1000s, 3 250s). Djokovic also claimed 6 wins over top 10 players this year.  This season was very similar in level to 2009, so the two could be swapped. Rating: C 10. 2008 - Djokovic had a stronger 2008 season, picking up 4 titles (1 Slam, 2 Masters, 1 WTF). His performance in the slams is similar to 2007, with a 1 win, 2 SF and 1 2R (Compared to 1 Final, 2 SF and 1 4R in 2007). He also performed similarly in Masters, winning 2, making a 3rd final and 2 more SF (compared to 2 Wins, 1 Final, 1 Semifinal in 2007).  Djokovic won 1 match against a number 1 player (Federer at AO) and 11 wins over top 10 players. Rating: C 9. 2020 - The Covid-19 season. Due to the lack of tournaments in this season, it's very difficult to tank when compared to others. In the reduced season, Djokovic had a very good winning record. He picked up 1 slam (AO), made another final (RG) and won two of the three masters that were held. In total, he picked up 4 titles (1 GS, 2 Masters, 1 500), a similar number to 2008. However when we consider he only competed in 8 tournaments, and made 5 finals (and was disqualified from one, so didn't actually lose due to skill), I believe that the 2020 season beats the 2008 season. Djokovic also picked up 10 matches over top 10 players, and ended the season with an 89% match win rate (3rd highest in his career!) Rating: B 8. 2018 - The comeback season. After having a pretty disappointing 2017 season, Djokovic came back in style, winning 2 grand slams (WIM and USO) as well as 2 more M1000s (and made a 3rd final). Djokovic didn't win any other titles, but made a total of 7 finals in the season. He finished with an 80% win rate, and returned to Year End number 1. By defeating Nadal in the Wimbledon SF, Nole also got another win over a number 1 player. Additionally, he got a whopping 15 wins over top 10 players. Rating: B 7. 2019 - 2019 was a very solid season for Djokovic. He managed to win 2 grand slams (AO and WIM), as well as grab 2 Masters 1000s (and make a third final). In total, Djokovic won 5 titles (2 GS, 2 M1000, 1 500), and made 6 finals. He finished Year end No. 2 with a respectable 84% win rate (compared to 2018's 80%). Nole took out Nadal in the AO final, bagging himself 1 match win against the best player in the world (other than himself ofc). He also won 9 matches against top 10 players, an average for his career. 2019 was a very similar season to 2018, however it was slightly more consistent, as he didn't start the season on a comeback road from injury. Rating: B 6. 2012 - An impressive season. Djokovic "only" won 1 grand slam this season, however his overall performance at the slams is the best so far, without a doubt. Djokovic has only ever had 5 seasons in which he made 3 GS finals, and only 4 seaons in which he made 4 GS semis. He won 1 slam (AO), made 2 finals and 1 SF. In the Masters 1000s, Nole took out 3 titles, and made another 3 finals. He also capped the year off by winning the YEC. In total, he bagged 6 titles (1 GS, 3 M1000s, 1 500, 1 WTF). Djokovic had an 86% win rate, which included beating 2 number one players (Federer and Nadal), and 24 top 10 players. Rating: A 5. 2013 - The hardcourt season. He had an equally good season in the slams as 2012, will 1 wins (AO), 2 finals (WIM instead of RG) and 1 SF.  In the M1000s, Djokovic won 3 titles. Overall, he won 7 titles (1 GS, 3 M1000s, 2 500s and 1 WTF), which is 1 more than 2012. Djokovic capped off the year by winning the Tour Finals and finished 2nd in the world (because Nadal had one of the best seasons of his life this year). Nole had an 89% win rate, higher than 2012. Finally, he claimed two wins against the top ranked player (both Nadal), an equal number to 2012.. He also claimed 24 wins over top 10 players, equal to 2012. Rating : A 4. 2014 - A fantastic season. This was the second year in Djokovic's career in which he responded to a strong Nadal season with a wipeout season. In the slams, Djokovic won 1 (WIM), made another final (RG), 1 SF (USO) and 1 QF (AO). While this isn't as impressive as 2012 or 2013, his performances in the Masters 1000s completely make up for it. Nole won 4 titles (the most so far), and made 2 SFs. A solid win rate of 88% (higher than 2012 but lower than 2013) was achieved, as well as a total of 7 titles (1 GS, 4 M1000s, 1 500, 1 WTF). Djokovic also defeated 2 number one players (equal to 2012 & 2013) and 19 top 10 players. This season was very close to 2013 in terms of quality, however the additional Masters makes up for a minutely lower win rate and a marginally worse performance in the slams. Rating: A 3. 2016 - The french open season. Until this point, Djokovic had made 3 RG finals, losing two to Nadal and another to Wawrinka. However, finally Djokovic claimed the RG title, completing the coveted career grand slam. In total, Nole won 2 slams (AO and RG) and made a 3rd final (USO). He also took out 4 Masters 1000s, and made a 5th final. Overall, he won 7 titles (2 GS, 4 M1000s and 1 250). Despite losing in the final of the YEC to Murray, Djokovic had an impeccable season, finishing with an 88% win rate. Nole beat Murray thrice, meaning he bagged the most wins against a number one player in a season thus far in the list. He also bagged 21 wins against top 10 players. There's definitely an argument for 2014 being ranked higher, however the additional grand slam and Masters final makes up for the lack of YEC win. Rating: A 2. 2011 - "Djokovic is having the greatest year in the history of our sport" - John McEnroe, 2011. This is the year that put Djokovic on the map as the greatest player in the world. His performance in the slams was ridiculous, winning 3 of the 4 slams, and making the SF of RG. In the Masters 1000s, he reached new heights, bagging a majority of the titles ( 5! ) and making a 6th final. Both of these performances completely one-up 2016. Overall, Djokovic won 10 titles (3 GS, 5 M1000s, 1 500, 1 250) a clear high in the list. He finished the year with an unstoppable 92% win rate, and clocked 6 wins over the next best player in the world (Nadal). Might I remind you that this is peak Nadal we are talking about. He claimed 21 wins over top 10 players, 4 of them being over near-peak Federer. This version of Djokovic was simply untouchable, and there is significant reasoning as to why this season is actually Djokovic's greatest. Rating: S However... 2015 - The statistician's fever dream. In this season, Djokovic pretty much did it all. He won 3 grand slams, and made a 4th final (RG). In doing so, he became the 3rd player in the Open Era to make all 4 major finals (after Laver in 1969 and Federer in 2006, 2007 and 2009). This is as close to perfect as you can get. He also had the best ever season in Masters 1000s, taking 6!!! of the 9 titles (an Open Era record), and making another 2 finals! This means that Djokovic competed in 8 of the 9 Masters 1000s finals in the year, which is another Open Era Record. He then capped the year off by winning the Tour Finals. His total title count for this unbeatable season was 11 (3GS, 6M1000, 1 500, 1 WTF) He also registered his best ever win rate of 93% , and in the process beat the next best player 5 times (all Roger). He also beat 31 top 10 players, the best in his career. This is Djokovic's greatest tennis season, and arguably the greatest tennis season of all time, for any player.
