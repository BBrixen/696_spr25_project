The lottery, which was originally scheduled for May 19, will now take place on Aug. 25. The 2020 NBA Draft, which was set for June 25, will now occur on Oct. 15. NBA has set an August 25 Draft Lottery and October 15 Draft, sources say. — Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) June 4, 2020 The Golden State Warriors won’t be playing any more basketball this season, as they’re too far out of the playoff picture to be included in the season restart plan. So these are now the dates to look forward to as a Warriors fan. The draft lottery will be an exciting day for Warriors fans, which it hasn’t been in a very long time. Here’s how the Warriors draft odds shake out: The Warriors are guaranteed a top-5 pick. Here are their odds for each selection. pic.twitter.com/6iKQnCWhL5 — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) June 3, 2020 Free agency will begin on Oct. 18, though some other business dates remain unclear, which matters extra for the Warriors this year since they have a limited amount of time to use Andre Iguodala ’s trade exception. Elsewhere in NBA news , the league officially voted in favor of the 22-team restart on July 31 in Orlando, Florida. The Portland Trail Blazers — despite being one of those 22 teams, but not currently in the playoffs — were reportedly the only team to vote against the new format. Sources: Portland was the lone team that voted against the 22-team format. https://t.co/WxxADXEkNb — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) June 4, 2020 The league is also tentatively planning on a quick turnaround after the 2020 playoffs. According to a report from Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium, the NBA is hoping to start 2020-21 training camps on November 10, with the season starting on December 1. Sources: The NBA informed the Board of Governors of scheduled dates: - Training camp: June 30, July 7 travel to Orlando - 2019-20 season: July 31 - Free agency: Oct. 18 - 2020-21 targets: Nov. 10 training camp, Dec. 1 opening night (can remain fluid) — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) June 4, 2020 It goes without saying that the state of the world and the coronavirus could impact that, and we have no idea whether the next season will take place in a bubble or in home arenas.
