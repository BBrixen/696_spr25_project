Members Online • PandaLabs04 Pixel 5a vs. 6a I have been using a Pixel 5a ever since it was released almost a year ago. I love this phone and I think it's underrated. I wanted to see how the 6a stacks up to it so I saw a couple of review videos and most of them made the phone sound forgettable. The problem is that most of these reviews compare the 6a to other premium phones while it is clearly meant to be an upgrade from older or budget phones like a 5a in my case or 3a.. I managed to get a quick impression of the 6a because a friend of mine got one and here is what I noticed (when compared to my 5a): The phone looks great, for a budget phone it really does look premium and has the new pixel look but with a thinner bump for those who want a more subtle look. The more square edges aren't uncomfortable and make the phone look better and the bezels are more even. While review videos made it seem like the phone is slow it seems just as fast or faster compared to the 5a. The screen looks great and the software is great for someone who is not used to fast refresh rates like the market the phone was meant for. This is more of a personal opinion but I still like the rear fingerprint sensor on my 5a because it will always be faster than an in screen sensor. However, the sensor didn't seem to be as laggy as I thought it would after seeing reviews. This is based on a quick impression and sort of a rant about reviews. Tldr: The 6a is a great phone for the people who it's meant for. People who are coming from older or budget phones. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.
