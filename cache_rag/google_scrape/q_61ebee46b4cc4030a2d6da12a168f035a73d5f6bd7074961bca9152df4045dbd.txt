Users can send text and voice messages on the platform or communicate live via voice or video chat. WhatsApp also supports location and image sharing. The service is primarily used on mobile phones , as it requires a mobile phone number to sign up, but the platform can be accessed via a computer’s Internet browser as well. What do you think? Does social media spur digital addiction and other ills? Explore the ProCon debate WhatsApp was founded in 2009 by Brian Acton and Jan Koum. Koum, a Ukrainian immigrant who had just begun attending classes at San Jose State University, and Acton, a Stanford-educated programmer, met while Acton was working for Internet pioneer Yahoo! in 1997. Koum was soon offered a job with the Mountain View, California-based company, where the duo grew close. They left Yahoo! in 2007, and in 2009 Koum created WhatsApp for the Apple iPhone with encouragement from Acton. While initially intended to track users’ work statuses, notifying their contacts of their availability, it quickly morphed into a messaging platform, as its early user base took to the app’s ability to send notifications to other users. Acton joined Koum at WhatsApp shortly after its launch and secured $250,000 in seed funding. The app officially launched for the iPhone in late 2009. Soon after, BlackBerry - and Android -compatible versions were released. About this time, WhatsApp became a paid service. It quickly rose through the Apple App Store charts and, in 2011, received an $8 million investment from Sequoia Capital in exchange for 15 percent ownership. In 2013 Sequoia invested another $50 million as the app topped 200 million active users. WhatsApp’s popularity stemmed from its ability to communicate across platforms (e.g., from Apple devices to Android devices) and internationally. Meta Meta, formerly Facebook, announced microblogging platform Threads in 2023, claiming that it would be made compatible with ActivityPub. (more) In 2014, though the company had lost $138 million the prior year, Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion. In 2016 WhatsApp abandoned its paid model and enabled video calls. That same year, users reading updated terms and conditions discovered that WhatsApp would begin sharing user data with Facebook, which Facebook would use to create targeted ads. However, Facebook had had access to this data since 2014. As a result, Facebook was fined €110 million (about $122 million) by the European Commission . Soon after, WhatsApp introduced end-to-end encryption, though its policies continue to be scrutinized by privacy advocates. In 2017 Acton left the company and invested heavily in a new messaging service called Signal, which he felt would better prioritize the total privacy of its users. In 2018 Koum stepped down as CEO of WhatsApp after almost a decade in charge. In the years since, WhatsApp has added several features on top of its basic messaging and calling, including stickers and group calls. WhatsApp has been criticized for allowing the spread of misinformation on its platform. In one series of particularly egregious cases, false rumors of children being abducted circulated in Indian WhatsApp circles. At least 18 people labeled as abductors were killed by lynch mobs seeking vengeance . WhatsApp was also criticized for facilitating the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 . While WhatsApp has been lauded by some groups for its end-to-end encryption, it has also been denounced for giving a platform to extremists. For example, the 2015 Paris attacks carried out by the terrorist group Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL; also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria [ISIS]) were likely plotted, at least in part, on WhatsApp. The platform has also likely been used to coordinate human trafficking . Police forces around the globe have lobbied for access to WhatsApp’s data, claiming that it would allow them to prevent extremist attacks and disrupt illegal trafficking. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States claimed it used WhatsApp surveillance to foil a plot to assassinate former president George W. Bush . This kind of individual tracking, despite its value in some cases, remains controversial. Though WhatsApp is used in 180 countries, some governments have taken a stance against it. Longer-term bans largely stem from anti-American or anti-western sentiment , while shorter bans often come during times of crisis, when governments shut down communication in order to curb use of the app by protestors. China has fully blocked use of the app since 2017. Iran , citing Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ’s alleged Zionism , has also banned the use of WhatsApp. Are you a student?
