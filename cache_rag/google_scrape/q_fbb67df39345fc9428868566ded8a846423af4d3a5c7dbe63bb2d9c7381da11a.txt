The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica Article History Table of Contents Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot What do Paris , Helsinki , Atlanta , Beijing , and Tokyo have in common? They all have hosted the Olympics . As the foremost international sporting event, the Olympic Games have been held in cities around the world—though certain regions, notably Africa , have yet to play host. In years past, the bidding process was highly competitive, as numerous cities campaigned to stage the Summer and Winter Games. However, fewer cities have vied for the honor in recent years. While the Games can increase tourism, boost local economies, and enhance a host country’s stature, critics have noted that the Olympics are hugely expensive, requiring cities to create costly infrastructure and buildings that later may fall into disuse. These and other challenges have led some to suggest permanent host sites. ( Discover seven ways that hosting the Olympics has an impact on a city .)
