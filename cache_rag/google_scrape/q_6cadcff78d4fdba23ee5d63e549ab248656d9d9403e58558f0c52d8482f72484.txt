Investor Relations Contact : http://ir.tesla.com On April 2, Tesla published production and delivery results for Q1 2021, which were even higher than in Q4 2020. This is an unprecedented result, reflecting the tireless work of Tesla's team and the strategically well-thought-out roadmap for the company. In Q1, Tesla produced 180,338 vehicles and delivered a record 184,800 units, reflecting an increase of 2.34% compared with Q4 2020. Previously, the company was unable to exceed in a Q1 the number of deliveries made in the Q4 just prior. However, this situation has now changed. Thanks to Tesla's new factory in China, which is constantly increasing production capacity and expanding, the increase in the number of cars produced and delivered continues to grow steadily. With the start of production at Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, the steady increase in figures from quarter to quarter will be even more stunning. In Q1 2021, Tesla delivered 2,020 Model S and X, reflecting the slowdown in production due to the commissioning of new equipment and production processes in preparation for the updated Model S and X, as well as their Plaid versions. However, the production figures of Model 3 and Y more than compensated for this. Impressively, Tesla produced 180,338 Model 3/Y and delivered 182,780 units. _____________________________ We appreciate your readership! Please share your thoughts in the comment section below.
