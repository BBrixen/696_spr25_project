Apple's "By Innovation Only" September 10 event invitation Members of the media have been informed of an event that will take place at 10 a.m. Pacific time in the Steve Jobs Theater, a building within the Apple Park campus in Cupertino. AppleInsider will be covering the event live, providing full analysis during and after the event, with particular attention made towards the iPhone launches. Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTube Confirming earlier rumors , this years' event takes place two days earlier than the one held in 2018, which was for the launch of the iPhone XS , iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR. The event has been a staple of September for the last eight years, starting with the iPhone 5 in 2012, with the launch and release of the new models a regular occurrence that capitalizes on the following holiday shopping period. Loosely known as the "iPhone 11" collection, this year's models are rumored to consist of three variants, with two premium OLED models accompanied by a third value-oriented LCD version, similar to 2018. Aside from the expected specifications bump, the new models will have one significant change over other versions. Apple's historic rainbow logo (left) next to the September event invitation image (right) The dominating rumor is that Apple will move to add an extra camera on the rear of each model across the board, bringing the OLED models up to three cameras and the LCD variant up to two. The extra camera is considered to have a wide-angle lens to accompany regular and telephoto versions. There has been some speculation Apple will add the "Pro" tag to at least one of the models, expanding the branding suffix to its premier product line for the first time. There is also the belief that Apple will include the ability to recharge other devices , possibly wirelessly, remove 3D Touch from all models, and will have a modified mute switch . Other products like a new iPad Pro family, a budget iPad, and so forth are expected soon . It isn't clear if Apple will just be talking about the iPhone at the event, or hold an event in October like it has done in the past. « 1 2 3 4 5 6 » Comments Reply 1 of 112 avon b7 Posts: 8,236 member August 29, 2019 4:09PM That's a daring title on the invite. Perhaps the fruity logo will make a return! Seriously, putting 'innovation' in there perhaps means there really is some meat in there with the potatoes after all. 2 Likes 0 Dislikes 2 Informatives Reply 2 of 112 ihatescreennames Posts: 2,003 member August 29, 2019 4:11PM I hadn’t really thought of it until just now but there seems to have been very few “leaks” about the new iPhones. Other than the addition of a third camera and some case photos/renders I haven’t heard much around hardware. Here’s to hoping the “innovation” part of the invitation surprises us. Although, as has been pointed out by others, if the overall look of the phone doesn’t change drastically there will be howls of outrage and disappointment and lack of innovation.

When a company is no longer willing or able to take risk it soon become irrelevant. 0 Likes 0 Dislikes 0 Informatives Reply 6 of 112 avon b7 Posts: 8,236 member August 29, 2019 4:21PM ihatescreennames said: I hadn’t really thought of it until just now but there seems to have been very few “leaks” about the new iPhones.

You are right. I mentioned this a couple of times a little while ago. A lot of the speculation has been around a slightly upgraded line of 2018 phones but it is equally true that there have been virtually no 'leaks' so far apart from the outer case. 2 Likes 0 Dislikes 0 Informatives Reply 7 of 112 mcjobs Posts: 29 member August 29, 2019 4:25PM Another Apple event that will be ruined by Tim Cook's fake excitement. 9 Likes 0 Dislikes 0 Informatives Reply 8 of 112 macapfel Posts: 575 member August 29, 2019 4:37PM multimedia said: This article should be amended to include the likelihood that a new set of WATCH Series 5 models will also be introduced at this event.

An accurate, non-invasive constant monitoring glucose reader would be a game changer for many people. 4 Likes 0 Dislikes 0 Informatives Reply 18 of 112 mike wuerthele Posts: 7,039 administrator August 29, 2019 5:11PM multimedia said: This article should be amended to include the likelihood that a new set of WATCH Series 5 models will also be introduced at this event. New faster processor, longer lasting battery, New titanium and ceramic enclosures. We have discussed this in another piece, and this is discussed in the video embedded in this one. For what it's worth, we had an inkling of a Series 4 last year, with the new sizes, and a Series 3 the year before that. The only thing we've got this year is new materials. https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/08/23/what-to-expect-at-apples-september-event---and-what-not-to 1 Like 0 Dislikes 2 Informatives Reply 19 of 112 japhey Posts: 1,773 member August 29, 2019 5:20PM vahancouver said: Instantly associated with some internal organs, something like the image below.

That would be great and I hope you’re right, but I thought that tech was still a few years away, according to most reports. I don’t know which would be more impressive...Apple finally finding a solution to the “holy grail”, or being able to do so without any leaks coming out. In think the colors most likely refer to the iPhone 11 (the XR successor) though. The green and lavender stood out to me. And the innovation probably refers to the new shatter-proof casing and screen along with the rumored matte finish. Just my opinion. edited August 2019 1 Like 0 Dislikes 0 Informatives Reply 20 of 112 freshmaker Posts: 532 member August 29, 2019 5:27PM Cain’t wait to order a new Watch! 3 Likes 0 Dislikes 0 Informatives « 1 2 3 4 5 6 » Sign In or Register to comment.
