Thank you #HollywoodForeignPress,” posted the filmmaker, who was not in attendance at yesterday’s awards ceremony and was conspicuously absent from the speeches of best actor (drama) winner Rami Malek and producer Graham King, who picked up the prize for best film (drama). Singer included a picture of Malek filming the I Want to Break Free scene along with his caption. The director was fired from the film’s shoot in 2017 after what Fox said were unexplained absences from set. Dexter Fletcher replaced Singer with roughly two weeks until wrap. Due to DGA rules, Singer was still credited as the film’s director. https://www.instagram.com/p/BsUtnmCn68A/ Must Read Stories Hide Articles Onyx Preps ‘Desperate Housewives’ Offshoot Via Kerry Washington & Natalie Chaidez Bleecker Street Media Founder & CEO Andrew Karpen Dies Of Cancer At 59 ‘Thunderbolts*’ Looks To Fire Up The Summer With $175M Global Bow: Preview Disney & Marvel Won’t Play Nicepool With Justin Baldoni In Blake Lively Battle Read More About: Bohemian Rhapsody Breaking News 26 Comments Subscribe to Deadline Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.
