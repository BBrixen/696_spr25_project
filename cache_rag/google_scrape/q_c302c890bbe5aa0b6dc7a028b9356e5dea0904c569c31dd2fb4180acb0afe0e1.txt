It also doesn’t hurt to have this level of acting talent in front of the camera. Full Review | Original Score: 3/5                                  | Aug 19, 2022 Brian Eggert Deep Focus Review Kurzel's brooding, internalized work often appears through a literal or figurative haze, which doesn't help matters. Full Review | Original Score: 1.5/4                                  | Apr 5, 2022 Matt Brunson Film Frenzy Assassin's Creed is many things, and none of them good. Visually, it's the ugliest movie of 2016 - and keep in mind that I saw Robert De Niro's prosthetic penis in Dirty Grandpa. Full Review | Original Score: 1/4                                  | Aug 17, 2021 Nick Rogers Midwest Film Journal Might be the best video-game adaptation there is. Certainly neck-and-neck with "Resident Evil: Extinction." There's a purity to how it doesn't pretend to characterize beyond narrative aims. It's 13% closing credits. It's kind of glorious, really. Full Review | Original Score: 3/5                                  | Apr 28, 2021 Richard Crouse Richard Crouse When the actors are not talking Assassin's Creed is quite silly and a bit of fun. Full Review | Original Score: 2.5/5                                  | Feb 3, 2021 Tony Asankomah GhMovieFreak This movie was better cast and better made than any video game movie you might have seen in the past 5 years. Full Review | Original Score: 7.5/10                                  | Nov 20, 2020 Dan Buffa KSDK News (St. Louis) Well, let's go ahead and outlaw video game adaptations right now. Full Review | Nov 10, 2020 David Hogan hoganreviews.co.uk The scenes in the past are fun but short-lived, otherwise there were times when I just felt like looking at my bookshelves to give me something more interesting to do... Full Review | Original Score: 2/5                                  | Sep 9, 2020 Ricardo Gallegos Pólvora Gamers will have to keep waiting, because not even two acting powerhouses managed to save this disastrous film. [Full review in Spanish] Full Review | Jul 2, 2020 Avaryl Halley Movie Bitches This movie felt really old. Full Review | May 8, 2020 Andrew Galdi Movie Bitches This movie was so boring. Full Review | May 8, 2020 Steven Prokopy Third Coast Review A visually murky, nonsensical work that has somehow attracted a large number of really talented actors to run through the paces of a story whose stakes are an utter mystery. Full Review | Apr 29, 2020 Grant Watson Fiction Machine It's a film that doesn't even have the self-respect to bore, but seems intent on making its audience angry with it instead. Full Review | Original Score: 2/10                                  | Sep 3, 2019 Dominic Griffin Spectrum Culture Nothing tempers expectations for a film's quality like seeing "based on the hit video game" tucked away on the poorly-produced poster. Full Review | Original Score: 2/5                                  | Jul 17, 2019 Kaitlyn Booth Bleeding Cool Assassin's Creed is a train-wreck that commits the cardinal sin of being boring on top of making no sense. Full Review | May 24, 2019 Sinead Brennan RTÉ (Ireland) Had the narrative only lived up to the quality of the stunts we'd be on to something great. Full Review | Original Score: 3/5                                  | Apr 25, 2019 Courtney Howard SassyMamaInLA A big pile of non-interactive, non-engaging nonsense. Full Review | Original Score: 1.5/5                                  | Apr 25, 2019 Scott Wampler Birth.Movies.Death. Assassin's Creed is not the top-to-bottom disaster some of my peers have painted it as, nor is it bonkers enough to suggest a forthcoming critical re-evaluation... either of those things would've been preferable to something this dour and repetitive. Full Review | Apr 25, 2019 Louisa Moore Screen Zealots Everything about this noisy, shallow mess of a movie is so convoluted and so dreadful that I doubt even die-hard fans of the video game on which its based would find much to enjoy in this cinematic voyage of sloppiness.
