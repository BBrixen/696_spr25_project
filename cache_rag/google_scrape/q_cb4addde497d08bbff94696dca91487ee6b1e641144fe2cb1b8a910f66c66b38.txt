The National Teacher of the Year is a professional award in the United States . The program began in 1952, as a project by the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), and aims to reward excellence in teaching . It is sponsored by ING . [ 1 ] Selection process [ edit ] Jason Kamras , 2005 Teacher of the Year, and President George W. Bush in the White House Rose Garden . Every year, nominations are made by students, principals, teachers and administrators for the State Teacher of the Year awards. [ 2 ] The profiles of the winners from all 50 states, the District of Columbia , American Samoa , Guam , Northern Mariana Islands , and U.S. Virgin Islands and the Department of Defense Education Activity are submitted to a selection committee made up of representatives from each of the major education organizations. [ 3 ] The committee then reviews the data for each candidate and selects four finalists. The winner is chosen from these finalists based on their biography, interview and eight essays they must submit. The President of the United States traditionally presents the award in the White House Rose Garden . Although there are no clearly defined requirements, the committee looks for: The ability to inspire children from all backgrounds and abilities The respect of colleagues, students, and parents Activity in the community The ability to fulfill the duties of the award [ 4 ] Duties [ edit ] The National Teacher of The Year spends a year away from their teaching duties to serve as a spokesman and advocate for the teaching profession. The teacher's state and district continue to pay his/her salary in this year. The arrangements for travel and speaking engagements during the recognition year are taken care of by the CCSSO. [ 5 ] Harassment and politics [ edit ] Several state winners in the 2020s reported harassment, including death threats, for having pro-LGBT views or being gay. Two were forced to abdicate their responsibilities. [ 6 ] Some states (like Georgia) require winners to be apolitical. Others look for candidates that support certain political positions, such as the Arkansas education reform law that limited classroom discussion of critical race theory and LGBT people, or anti-racism in Massachusetts.
