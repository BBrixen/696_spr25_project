Tours Photo Albums - Cruises Image Gallery Video Gallery Podcast Gallery Greenside Chats Golf Travel News Email Signup Log In History of The Open The Open, sometimes referred to as The British Open or The Open Championship, is the oldest of all four major championships in professional golf – The Masters, The US Open, The Open, and The PGA Championship.  The Open  was first played on October 17, 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Scotland.  While the other three majors are played in the United States, The Open is played outside the U.S. as it is administered by the R&A – the governing body of golf outside the U.S. and Mexico. The tournament is held every year on one of ten links courses amidst Scotland, England and Northern Ireland. The R&A appoints the host of the championship typically three years in advance. The Open is always played on the weekend of the third Friday in July.  It is a 72-hole stroke play tournament with a cut at the end of the first two rounds, limiting the field to the top 70 players and ties.  In the event of a tie after 72 holes, The Open features a four-hole playoff and continues to sudden-death if a winner has still not emerged. Over the years of The Open, several awards have been given out for various achievements.  Some of these include the Challenge Belt, The Gold Medal, The Silver Medal, and the Bronze Medal.  Today perhaps the most prized award is The Claret Jug.  Also known as the Golf Champion Trophy, it replaced the Challenge Belt and has been awarded to the winner each year since 1873.

Mr. Jacob H. Scotland This was my second trip with PerryGolf, and as it has been in the past, a fantastic trip.  I can't say enough about your company and your entire staff.
