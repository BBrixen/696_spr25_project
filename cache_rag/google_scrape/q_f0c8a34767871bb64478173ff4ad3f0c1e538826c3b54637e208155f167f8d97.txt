In the 1920’s she served on the first Board of Directors at the New York State Credit Union League, and in 1931 helped to organize the Credit Union National Extension Bureau, which later became the Credit Union National Association. In addition to organizing hundreds of credit unions, Maxwell developed volunteer credit union organizations to help improve the living standards of the poor and needy. CUNA created the Dora Maxwell Social Responsibility Award to encourage and honor credit union and chapter involvement in community projects and activities. Dora Maxwell was a community activist who committed her life to credit union development, to her community and to serving the underserved. This award recognizes model credit union efforts to strengthen local institutions and materially improve the lives of nonmembers through community outreach programs (other than personal finance education). Examples: Internship program Charity fundraising Support for public events Donations to social service programs VITA or EITC assistance Lobbying or advocacy on behalf of K-12 financial education Support for teacher training NOMINATIONS ARE NOW CLOSED. 800.995.9064 Serving Credit Unions in the Following States Arizona Colorado Idaho Oregon Washington Wyoming Mailing Address GoWest Credit Union Association 18000 International Blvd, Ste. 1102 Seatac, WA 98188 Links About Us Acknowledgment of Risk Contact Us Credit Union Directory For Reporters GoWest Foundation GoWest Solutions Our Commitments Privacy Policy Submit Your News Speak At A Future Event Safelist Us Customize Your Experience Sign up for On The Go News, alerts, updates, event & registration information, and more.
