He has coached Women's Tennis Association (WTA) player Aryna Sabalenka since 2020. With Dubrov as her coach, Sabalenka became the world No. 1 in women's singles and has won 14 WTA Tour -level singles titles, including three majors at the 2023 Australian Open , 2024 Australian Open , and 2024 US Open . Playing career [ edit ] Dubrov started playing tennis at age five. [ 2 ] His peak International Tennis Federation (ITF) junior ranking was No. 272, reached in 2013. [ 2 ] Over the course of his playing career, he earned a single Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) ranking point by winning just one out of his ten main-draw singles matches on the ITF Men's Circuit from 2013 to 2015, but continued occasionally to enter ITF qualifying draws until 2018. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Coaching career [ edit ] Dubrov was Aryna Sabalenka 's longtime hitting partner before becoming her primary coach in 2020, replacing longtime coach Dmitry Tursunov after a stint with Dieter Kindlmann . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Sabalenka, then ranked just outside the WTA's top 10, found increasingly consistent results with Dubrov, winning four WTA Tour titles in the first year of his coaching tenure. Ranked world No. 2 at the end of 2021, she credited him with helping her feel more "confident" in her game, offering feedback "in a nice way". [ 4 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] In February 2022, as Sabalenka resisted her team's efforts to rework her serve while having high-profile trouble with double faults , Dubrov offered to resign, but Sabalenka convinced him to stay on, promising that "we'll come back stronger". [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] An expert in biomechanics was brought in to help fix her serve in August 2022, and after winning her first Major singles title at the 2023 Australian Open , she thanked her "craziest team on tour" of Dubrov and fitness trainer Jason Stacy for supporting her over a tumultuous previous year.
