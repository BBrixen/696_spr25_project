Since the Switch successor will (at the minimum) have PS4/Xbox One-level power, this also means that the most large-scale games developed for it will take longer to finish than before. 3D Zelda itself is no stranger to long development times or large gaps between releases itself; here's how long the release gaps between each major Zelda title since The Wind Waker were: Twilight Princess: 4 years (WW late 2002 => TP late 2006) Skyward Sword: 5 years (TP late 2006 => Skyward Sword late 2011) Breath of the Wild: 5.5 years (Skyward Sword late 2011 => BOTW early 2017) Tears of the Kingdom: >6 years (BOTW early 2017 => TOTK mid 2023) As such, the next major Zelda title will likely take the longest in its history. With that said, when do you think it'll wind up releasing? Quoted by: Giancarlo , Giancarlo 2 GenOneCam Like Like Pronouns They/Them Jun 20, 2024 #2 Tears of the Kingdom has the huge caveat of a global pandemic occurring during development. I don't think the next 3D Zelda will take 6 or more years. I am guessing 2028. 0 8 Josh5890 Pokémon Trainer Founder Kirby is White? A Real Shit Time Koality Participant Proud Participant Pronouns He/Him Jun 20, 2024 #3 2027 is the absolute best case scenario, and I only say that because TotK was largely done a year before it released.

Jun 20, 2024 #4 I'm gonna say probably 2028 or 2029, but with one potential curveball I wouldn't rule out the possibility that a kind of b-team could put together a smaller-scope "Miles Morales/Bowser's Fury" sort of expandalone-tier game, taking the basic tools and assets of BotW/TotK but applying them to a more focused and less sprawling world outside of those games' Hyrule. If they go that route, I'd say maybe 2026 or 2027 isn't totally out of the realm of possibility 0 1 Thunder84 Manakete Pronouns He/Him Jun 20, 2024 #5 2029. Same length as Tears of the Kingdom. The time lost due to the pandemic will be offset by the additional time needed due to games just taking longer to develop these days. Nintendo isn’t gonna rush it out, and they aren’t gonna have any shortage of games in the meantime either. 0 oldpuck Kremling Pronouns he/they Jun 20, 2024 #6 2029. If it's faster than that, I would be happy, but I don't expect it. The Zelda team is notorious for not being able to make timelines. ToTK took 6 years, when reusing the game world. Next gen visuals are going to increase the load on the team. While the engine seems an extremely solid base from which to build, it's hard to imagine how much farther they'll need to innovate to top ToTK - highly destructible environments? Breath of the Wild took 5.5 years. Expanding only to 6 seems almost optimistic. Quoted by: Aufhebung RPG 1 aus89 Reality Gangster Topic Star Pronouns He/Him Jun 20, 2024 #7 Ocarina remake at some point first - 2028 seems logical for the anniversary or it could be alongside the movie (which could also be 2028 for all we know given Mario sequel is 2026 and Zelda isnt coming out before that), and a new 3D Zelda towards the end of the generation - because they will take their time deciding where to take the open air format after TOTK and have a substantial remake to tide people over. 3D Zelda is basically their biggest AAA game - so its timeline will be on the same trajectory as TOTK Last edited: Jun 21, 2024 0 1 Wockio Made of Igglybuff Fluff Pronouns He Jun 20, 2024 #8 TotK was probably meant to come out in Holiday 2021 before COVID, so that's something to keep in mind Quoted by: Linkstrikesback 1 3 Mekanos Emerald Echidna Adventures in Babysitting Gorilla Gone The End?

They must have been thinking TotK wouldn't take as long as it did when they announced it. I personally would have preferred them not release TotK and make it into an entirely new Zelda for year 1/2 of Switch 2's life. I simply don't understand what took TotK so long. Did they originally change more things from BotW only to go back and keep them the same? Did they come up with Ultrahand late into development? Because if everything went fairly smoothly then that does not bode well for the next game. Good thing they have those remasters to fill in the gaps. Last edited: Jun 21, 2024 0 D Deleted member 6315 Guest Jun 21, 2024 #12 I have the feeling that development had already begun before TotK 2022 had reached "gold status". I could therefore imagine 2027. I also fully expect an announcement to be made in the first Direct after the release of the Switch 2. However, it will only be an announcement, as was the case with Metroid Prime 4 in 2017. They'll just say: "A new The Legend of Zelda game is now in development for the Switch 2." 0 Irene nu flyger vi calle Administrator Event Organizer Staff Service Topic Star Pronouns She/Her Jun 21, 2024 #13 No later than Fall 2028. I think no-one, team included, want another 5-6 years of waiting. (And I think.... or at least hope... that we don't get another pandemic) I think they'll announce it in Q1 2026 for Q4 2026, it will be delayed into Q1 2027. 0 1 Rareware Chain Chomp Jun 21, 2024 #14 I think 2027 at the earliest, 2028 at the latest. They spent a year just polishing and perfecting the game, so I imagine they already had a lot of dedicated staff working on the next Zelda game some time in 2022 and then everyone moved over to the new game in 2023. So that would give it a good 5 years of dev time approximately for a 2027 release. I think the bigger thing that would increase the time is whether or not they stick with the same engine or they decide to create another new one for the next game. If they take that route, then definitely don’t see it releasing before 2028. Oh and let’s not forget that they’ll be working with much more powerful hardware as well. So that alone could increase dev time, too. 0 2 Dardan Sandiego Dill Spowser's Nephew Founder Shitpost Finalist Hardest Wares - Gold Estrogen Hunter Pronouns he/him Jun 21, 2024 #15 Difficult to say without knowing how "complete" Tears of the Kingdom was before that alleged one year of polishing but I suspect (or maybe desperately hope?) that the next one already started development during that time.

Neither totk nor botw have actually been in development for more than 4 years. botw was conceived and developed in early 2013, and totk in early 2018. totk was actually completed in 2022, but the complexity of ultrahand and fully physical interactions made them take a year to optimize.

That will need some time to develop. We know that they want to stay with the Open Air design philosophy, but that doesn't mean that it has to copy BOTW and TOTK, there are different ways to achieve that. Creating a new world that follows BOTW's design principles takes a ton of time. On the other hand, developing a new Open Air game that specifically distances itself from BOTW and TOTK will also take a lot of time. One way or another, it will take years, so I don't see the next entry releasing before 2028. I think 2029 is the earliest we'll see it and given the history of 3D Zeldas getting delays and needing more time it wouldn't surprise me if it gets pushed to 2030. It's depressing, really. 0 3 Buried In Time Wave Racer & Windjammer Pronouns he/him Jun 21, 2024 #23 Holiday 2025. Tears of the Kingdom released in May 2023, but we've heard they spent the last year polishing and bugfixing, so technically the bulk of the creative work was done by 2022, and even then it's possible, since the game was in the same engine and world as BotW and a lot of the work was iterating on physics puzzles, that Eiji Aonuma might have begun work on next gen Zelda (while still overseeing Tears) in early 2021.

If it is earlier, it will have delay. 0 Secu Koopa Jun 21, 2024 #28 I would say 2027, the essence is for commercial considerations. Nintendo hopes to quickly attract Zelda's fan base to Switch 2. From this perspective, it is highly likely that they will release a linear traditional Zelda game, which will shorten development time. Meanwhile, I do not believe that the development time of BOTW and TOTK can be used as accurate references. We all know that both encountered significant issues during the development process. The impact of COVID on game development was underestimated by many people, and during that period, game development in many studios was basically stagnant. 0 1 OctoSplattack Darknut Moderator Ribbon Champion Mark of the Beast Yummy Challenge A Smile That Lasts Forever Pronouns He/Him Jun 21, 2024 #29 I would imagine that they're targeting 2028, with potential for the game to slip into 2029, because that sort of delay/schedule slip is just par for the course with the larger-scoped 3D entries.

Nintendo has expanded a whole lot and the Zelda team should now bigger than ever and with more impressive tools to work with than ever before - I think we're going to see they're target a brand new entry holiday 2027 at the latest, 0 1 Danny Inkling Pronouns He/Him Jun 21, 2024 #33 What i think about next 3D Zelda game development timeline: Tears of the Kingdom was almost complete by 2022, after that they only did polishing work on the game. So i think its possible that Zelda leads like Aonuma started up pre production of the next 3D Zelda game around that time, another reason why they did not make any DLC for Tears of the Kingdom is also probably related to the fact that they were already pretty deep into pre production of the next 3D Zelda game by that point. Pre production does not take many dev resources, only a few project leads that decide on things like art style, game mechanics, scope and budget. So i think at this point in time pre production has probably been underway for maybe 1,5-2 years. So i actually think they are about to leave pre production phase of the project to actual development starting by now if not already underway. Also one thing to consider is that Nintendo has more development resources today than when they started working on BOTW, meaning Nintendo can probably put more developers into working on the game at an earlier stage of development than they could on BOTW, so there are probably at this stage already many EPD developers working on the next 3D Zelda game even though actual development has just started. And Nintendo will not have to deal with stuff like developers working from home due to covid, now the Zelda team are all in the EPD building together which Nintendo sees as more effective when making games. I see 2027 as a realistic release year, with our first tease of the game coming in 2026, when the Switch 2 is 1 year old.

And honestly, I'd prefer that to an earlier release if they're as ambitious for it with the Switch 2 in mind as they were for BOTW with Wii U/Switch. In the meantime, we'll get rereleases/remasters to tide us over. 0 1 Adulfzen Koopa Pronouns he/him Jun 21, 2024 #35 Tears of the Kingdom was impacted by covid, don't know why some people don't take that into account when trying to predict the dev time for future entries. That being said a brand new Zelda with a new setting (whether it's Hyrule or not) and on next gen hardware is definitely gonna take some dev time, so I'm gonna guess 2028 ? The fact that Aonuma also said they weren't gonna do any DLC would mean they already fully moved on to the next entry. 0 4 Hylianhero777 Moblin Pronouns He/Him Jun 21, 2024 #36 If Nintendo wants something 3D with the name Zelda sooner than later on Switch 2, they should make a standalone spinoff that's just TOTK Link going through a new story that essentially puts him through a bunch of shrines back to back. Think Portal/Portal 2 but with TOTK's mechanics. Would probably be a nice change of pace for a smaller team to tackle and I just think a linear super puzzle focused game with TOTK's toolkit would be awesome. Also, this may be wishful thinking, but I think Switch 2 may actually help speed up the Zelda team's workflow rather than slow it down. If they keep using (relatively) simplistic artstyles going forward, then Switch 2 might give them a lot more overhead to work with. I imagine the year of polish TOTK needed was at least in part due to the fact that it was a nightmare to optimize for Switch 1 hardware. 0 1 joveroy Like Like Pronouns He/Him Jun 21, 2024 #37 Aufhebung RPG said: Neither totk nor botw have actually been in development for more than 4 years. botw was conceived and developed in early 2013, and totk in early 2018. totk was actually completed in 2022, but the complexity of ultrahand and fully physical interactions made them take a year to optimize.

All of the companies that have fallen into the cost black hole have done so because most of their game development time and costs have ballooned massively, because these titles are AAA titles, whereas Nintendo only has one series, Zelda, that takes such a long time to develop for production, and because Nintendo's development model would be effective at saving money, and Aonuma has said that the core developers that are getting into the 300 or 400 size of the workforce are manpower that will be invested in the later stages of development. 0 Giancarlo Nintendo  refertur in risu, loco et ludis Jun 21, 2024 #49 RoyalGoldenFES said: It's a given that the next mainline 3D Zelda game is already in development for the Switch successor, but a worthwhile question to ask is when it will wind up releasing.

Click to expand... i imagine the next 3D Legend of Zelda  is already in pre-production, if we take the 5/6 years Breath of the Wild/Tears of the kingdom  took to develop, the next 3D Legend of Zelda  would  be ready by 2028. 0 1 2 Next 1 of 2 Go to page Go Next Last You must log in or register to reply here.
