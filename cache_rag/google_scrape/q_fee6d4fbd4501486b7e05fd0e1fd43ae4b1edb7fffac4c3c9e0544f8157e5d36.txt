Contents 1 Features 2 Design techniques 3 Ranks 4 Milestones 5 Additional content 6 Changes from Happy Home Designer 7 Vacation Home Requests 8 Gallery 8.1 Videos Features In the Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise paid DLC, players can design vacation homes and islands for villagers who are interested. Lottie , along with two new characters, Niko and Wardell , will assist the player in the Paradise Planning office and on the archipelago. In the office, the player can buy rare items for Poki, which are earned after designing vacation homes and facilities. It's company policy that everyone working for Paradise Planning--including the player--wears a uniform while on the job. On the second floor of the office, there is a locker where the player can edit their work clothes with shoes, bags, and accessories. Design techniques The player can learn the following design techniques after finishing vacation homes: Polishing furniture with various effects Changing room size (only works on vacation homes and facilities) Customizing windows, entryways, special colored room lighting, and soundscapes Learning recipes for partition walls, pillars, and tall and low island counters Ranks The higher the player’s rank, the higher their pay for each new vacation home. The player also gets access to more work uniform options. Default = 6,000 Poki Promised Designer = 9,000 Poki Breakout Designer = 12,000 Poki Famous Designer = 15,000 Poki Superstar Designer = 20,000 Poki (84 Points) Legendary Designer = 30,000 Poki (116 Points) GOAT Designer = 40,000 Poki (149 Points) Milestones There will sometimes be an additional bonus for completing a certain number of homes. 2 Homes Completed: Unlock Happy Home Network 3 Homes Completed: Unlock polishing 4 Homes Completed: Unlock the School and changeable room sizes 5 Homes Completed: Unlock a Storage cabinet in the second floor of Paradise Planning 6 Homes Completed: Rank up to Promised Designer 7 Homes Completed: Unlock the amiibo scanner 8 Homes Completed: Unlock Wall Partitions 11 Homes Completed: Rank up to Breakout Designer 12 Homes Completed: Unlock Restaurant and Café and lighting customizability and extra polishing effects 13 Homes Completed: Unlock the ability to view other player ' s designs online on the Happy Home Network 15 Homes Completed: Unlock the ability to use DIY furniture previously crafted 16 Homes Completed: Unlock the ability to create roommates 17 Homes Completed: Unlock Soundscapes 18 Homes Completed: Unlock the ability to add second stories to homes 19 Homes Completed: Unlock the ability to invite special characters with amiibo and rank up to Famous Designer 24 Homes Completed: Unlock the Hospital 25 Homes Completed: Unlock additional Soundscapes 25 Homes Completed: Unlock feature to place items from the Furniture Catalog 30 Homes Completed: Unlock the Apparel Shop and ability to decorate villager homes on the main island, if you build the Apparel Shop , DJ K.K. will come 33 Homes Completed: Unlock additional Soundscapes (Cyber, Alley, Factory, Train, Storm, Rumbling, Cave, Underwater) 40 Homes Completed: Unlock Room Sketch app Additional content Vacation Home Requests (see Vacation Home Requests ) New reactions : Grooving Hop Groove Right Groove Left Soak It In Side-to-Side Island Stomp Airplane Twisty Dance Shimmy Turnip Patch Arm-Swing Dance Changes from Happy Home Designer New items and interior design features introduced in New Horizons are generally also available in Happy Home Paradise , such as the ability to adjust the vertical position of wall-mounted decor. Other changes are noted below: The number of facilities has decreased from ten to five. The second shop, business office, department store, music hall, and hotel are removed. The School facility cannot be upgraded with additional rooms. The item search feature has been removed, and the item category system has been simplified. Basements and multi-room layouts have been removed (second-floor rooms are still available). The player can now manually adjust the size of a room (once that feature is unlocked). Customization of window frames, curtains, and doors have been removed. Each type of wall that supports windows comes with a preset window design, and many types of walls do not allow windows. The number of exterior architectures for homes has decreased from 29 to 7. Roof and siding options are now specific to each type of house, rather than being shared across all exterior designs. The overall number of roof, siding, and door options is greatly reduced. Whimsical exterior themes such as gingerbread and cardboard are no longer available. Because the 3DS-specific Play Coins feature is not available on the Nintendo Switch, the ability to unlock new design features with Play Coins has been removed. New design features are generally unlocked automatically as the player completes more homes and facilities. Players can now choose where to build fences and can use multiple styles of fence around one home. Players can adjust the time of day when designing the exterior of a home. Players can now adjust the brightness and color of the room lighting (once that feature is unlocked). Full-height wall partitions, generic wooden pillars, and two sizes of generic wooden counters have been added for further room customization options. Players can now assign roommates, adding additional residents to a single home. Players now earn currency for creating or renovating homes and facilities, which can be used to purchase items for use on their main island, or converted to Bells (once that feature is unlocked). Vacation Home Requests Like in Happy Home Designer , each villager in Happy Home Paradise requests a different theme and some have pre-determined furniture. When you unlock the suggestion feature, if you recommend a theme, the pre-determined furniture will disappear, and you recommend your own theme.
