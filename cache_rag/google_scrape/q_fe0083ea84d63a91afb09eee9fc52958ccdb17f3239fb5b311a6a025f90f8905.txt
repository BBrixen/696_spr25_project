Having started his career as a youth at Celta Vigo , Pogba played briefly for Quimper in France before following his brother Paul to the United Kingdom, where he played for Wrexham and Crewe Alexandra . After four years in the English leagues, he moved to Italian Serie B side Pescara in 2014, but returned to England with Crawley Town only a few months later. After short spells at Scotland's Partick Thistle and in the Netherlands at Sparta Rotterdam , he joined Tours in September 2018. During the 2019–20 season, he played in Spain for both Manchego and Lorca . Pogba has also played five times for the Guinea national team since his debut in 2013. In December 2024, Pogba was sentenced to three years in prison, with two years suspended, for attempted extortion of €13 million ($13.5 million) from his brother Paul Pogba . [ 3 ] Club career [ edit ] Early career [ edit ] After growing up in Paris , Pogba joined the youth system at Spanish side Celta Vigo along with his twin brother Florentin . [ 4 ] The pair left the club in 2009, with Pogba stating his time there was difficult due to language barriers, living abroad and being away from his family. [ 5 ] He returned to France to join fourth division side Quimper , scoring twice in the league during one season at the club. While at the club, he lived with Algerian international Riyad Mahrez . [ 6 ] Wrexham [ edit ] In September 2010, Pogba joined Conference National side Wrexham after a successful trial spell in August 2010.

[ 9 ] It took until 3 January 2011 for Pogba to score his first Wrexham goal, in a 2–0 win over Bath City . [ 10 ] Pogba then scored two goals in two games against Cambridge United [ 11 ] and Mansfield Town . [ 12 ] His fourth goal later came on 22 February 2011, in a 1–0 win over Wimbledon . [ 13 ] His scoring form in January soon led Pogba to sign a new contract, keeping him at the club until 2012. [ 14 ] Pogba made 29 appearances and scored four times in his first season at Wrexham. Pogba in 2011 In the 2011–12 season, Pogba played in the first two games, but was then dropped for two matches, due to an off-the-pitch issue. [ 15 ] He returned to the first team against Alfreton Town and scored his first goal of the season in a 4–1 win. [ 16 ] By the end of December, Pogba had scored a further six times (against Grimsby Town , [ 17 ] Hayes & Yeading United , [ 18 ] Luton Town , [ 19 ] Lincoln City . [ 20 ] and two against Gateshead ) [ 21 ] in 22 appearances. After being sidelined for two games due to fitness, [ 22 ] Pogba made his return against Forest Green Rovers , only to be sidelined for the third time after suffering an ankle injury. [ 23 ] On his return, Pogba scored in a 4–1 win over Hayes & Yeading United on 18 February 2012. [ 24 ] He later added three more goals (against Ebbsfleet United , [ 25 ] Darlington [ 26 ] and Braintree Town ). [ 27 ] He was voted the club's young player of the year during the 2011–12 season. [ 28 ] Out of contract at the end of the year, Pogba was offered a new two-year deal by the club, [ 29 ] which he rejected in a bid to play football at a higher level. Wrexham boss Andy Morrell criticised Pogba's handling of the situation, describing him as "disrespectful" to the club after not informing them of his intention to leave until 48-hours before the start of the club's pre-season.

[ 36 ] He made his first team return, coming on as a substitute for A-Jay Leitch-Smith in the 62nd minute, in a 1–0 loss against Milton Keynes Dons on 29 September 2012. [ 37 ] By the end of December, Pogba scored four more league goals in 20 appearances (against Doncaster Rovers , [ 38 ] Colchester United , [ 39 ] Sheffield United [ 40 ] and Oldham Athletic ), [ 41 ] while scoring two more goals in separate cup competitions against Wycombe Wanderers [ 42 ] and Doncaster Rovers.

[ 58 ] On 22 March 2014, he scored his third goal of the season, in a 3–1 win over Gillingham . [ 59 ] Pogba later added two more goals towards the final month of the season (against Shrewsbury Town [ 60 ] and Preston). [ 61 ] Despite an injury-hit 2013–14 season, he made 22 appearances and scored five times. Ahead of the 2014–15 season, manager Steve Davis was determined that Pogba could play as a central striker, [ 62 ] but Pogba wanted to leave Crewe despite the club's attempt to persuade him to stay.

[ 68 ] Crawley Town [ edit ] Pogba signed for League One team Crawley Town on 4 February 2015 after his release by Pescara. [ 69 ] Three days after signing for the club, he made his Crawley Town debut, in a 2–1 loss against Yeovil Town .
