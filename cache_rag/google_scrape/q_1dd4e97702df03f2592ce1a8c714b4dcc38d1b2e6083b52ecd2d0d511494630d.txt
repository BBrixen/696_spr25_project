Assassin's Creed What to Know Critics Consensus Assassin's Creed is arguably better made (and certainly better cast) than most video game adaptations; unfortunately, the CGI-fueled end result still is still a joylessly overplotted slog. Read Critics Reviews Critics Reviews View All (226) Critics Reviews Elena Lazic Little White Lies Although this story of multiple timelines provides some interesting moments, the cryptic, excessive, often extremely muffled dialogue makes the film excruciatingly hard to follow. Rated: 2/5 Jul 3, 2018 Full Review Valerie Complex Black Girl Nerds I have never seen a group of A-list actors look and act so disinterested. Rated: 1.5/5 Jan 19, 2017 Full Review Donald Clarke Irish Times One is left wracking brains as to why these talented people wasted so much time. It's not even the best videogame adaptation released in the past 12 months. Come back, Angry Birds. All is forgiven. Rated: 2/5 Jan 10, 2017 Full Review Zach Pope Zach Pope Reviews The worst way to adapt a video game Aug 7, 2023 Full Review Keith Garlington Keith & the Movies I had fun with “Assassin’s Creed” particularly with its wildly unique (and admittedly wacky) story. It also doesn’t hurt to have this level of acting talent in front of the camera. Rated: 3/5 Aug 19, 2022 Full Review Brian Eggert Deep Focus Review Kurzel's brooding, internalized work often appears through a literal or figurative haze, which doesn't help matters. Rated: 1.5/4 Apr 5, 2022 Full Review Read all reviews Audience Reviews View All (1000+) audience reviews Jade Coyote good acting good action weak writing and story telling Rated 3.5/5 Stars • Rated 3.5 out of 5 stars 01/07/22 Full Review R 3 Very good action scenes, almost like in the game. In short, it fulfills the objective of a movie: having a good time watching an action movie. Rated 4/5 Stars • Rated 4 out of 5 stars 04/26/25 Full Review Paul S Despite its visual flare, the story made no sense to me, and it felt really disconnected from the games. This movie can definitely be avoided, whether you're an Assassin's Creed fan or not. Rated 1.5/5 Stars • Rated 1.5 out of 5 stars 04/23/25 Full Review Audience Member The only thing wrong with this film is that they had to try and tell an entire Assassins Creed story in under 2 hours. I wish they would have used a limited series for it. That being said, I liked the movie a lot. Rated 3.5/5 Stars • Rated 3.5 out of 5 stars 04/14/25 Full Review Ian K For a film made from a computer game, it started pretty strongly - and went well up to about 2/3 of the way through. The "Apple of Eden contains the key to free will" plotline was always total bollocks, but the action sequences and some sub-plots (father/son, father/daughter, potential being realised) were not bad. Then the ending was so gob-smackingly awful: the assassins... assassinated everyone in about 2 minutes and the film just ended. Game over. Rated 2.5/5 Stars • Rated 2.5 out of 5 stars 04/11/25 Full Review D P No. Rewrite this, please. I am not even familiar with the video game, but my son chose the film because he knew about the video game. They probably would have written a more interesting story if they had just stayed in the past.
