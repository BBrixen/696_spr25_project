He was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York. Best known as the co-founder and CEO of Facebook (now Meta Platforms, Inc.), Zuckerberg played a pivotal role in revolutionizing the way people connect and communicate around the globe.  His journey from a Harvard dorm room to the helm of a multi-billion-dollar tech empire is a modern tale of innovation, controversy, and ambition. Early Life and Education Zuckerberg was raised in the nearby village of Dobbs Ferry, New York, in a well-educated household.  His father, Edward Zuckerberg, is a dentist, and his mother, Karen, worked as a psychiatrist before becoming a stay-at-home mom.  Mark demonstrated an early interest in computers and programming.  At the age of 12, he developed a messaging program called “ZuckNet” for his father’s dental office, enabling communication between the house and the practice. He attended Ardsley High School and later transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy, a prestigious prep school in New Hampshire.  There, he excelled in the classics and won prizes in science and math.  Zuckerberg also developed games and software when he was younger, including Synapse Media Player, a music player that used artificial intelligence to learn user preferences. Companies like Microsoft and AOL showed interest in the software, but Zuckerberg declined their offers. Harvard and the Birth of Facebook In 2002, Zuckerberg enrolled at Harvard University, where he studied computer science and psychology.  At Harvard, he quickly gained a reputation as a programming prodigy.  Zuckerberg launched "TheFacebook" from his dorm room with his college roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes during his sophomore year in 2004. The idea was to create an online directory for Harvard students to connect with each other. The platform quickly spread across other Ivy League schools and eventually to universities across the U.S. and Canada.  In June 2004, Zuckerberg moved the operation to Palo Alto, California, and dropped out of Harvard to focus full-time on the growing company.  That summer, Facebook secured its first significant investment from Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal. Rise of Facebook and Expansion Over the next few years, Facebook exploded in popularity.  By 2006, it opened registration to anyone over the age of 13 with a valid email address.  Facebook's transformation from a college networking tool to a global social platform was marked by this decision. Features like the News Feed, Timeline, and “Like” button became integral to online interaction. Zuckerberg steered Facebook through multiple stages of growth, including acquisitions of Instagram (2012), WhatsApp (2014), and Oculus VR (2014), solidifying the company’s dominance in social media, messaging, and virtual reality. Meta and the Future In October 2021, Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would be rebranded as Meta Platforms, Inc., reflecting the company’s growing focus on building the metaverse—a virtual, interconnected space where users can interact using avatars and immersive technologies.  The rebrand signaled a shift toward long-term innovation in virtual and augmented reality. Despite criticism and skepticism from some quarters, Zuckerberg has remained steadfast in his vision, investing billions into developing technologies that may define the next era of the internet. Controversies and Challenges Zuckerberg's career has not been without controversy.  From privacy concerns to misinformation, Facebook has faced numerous challenges under his leadership.  The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, where user data was improperly harvested, drew widespread condemnation and led to congressional hearings.  Zuckerberg testified before the U.S.  Congress, defending the company’s data practices and pledging to make improvements. Other criticisms have revolved around Facebook’s handling of hate speech, election interference, and the mental health impacts of social media.  These issues have sparked global debates about the responsibilities of tech companies and the regulation of digital platforms. Personal Life Mark Zuckerberg married Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician and philanthropist, in 2012.  The couple met at Harvard and have two daughters.  Together, they founded the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), a philanthropic organization committed to advancing science, education, and justice.  CZI has pledged billions toward goals such as curing diseases and improving access to education. Despite his wealth—often ranking among the richest people in the world—Zuckerberg is known for his relatively modest lifestyle, famously wearing the same gray t-shirt every day to minimize decision fatigue. Legacy Mark Zuckerberg’s impact on the digital age is undeniable.  He helped redefine how people communicate, share, and interact, influencing not only technology but also politics, culture, and business.  Whether admired as a visionary or criticized for Facebook’s societal impact, Zuckerberg's role in shaping the modern internet ensures his place in the history of innovation. Zuckerberg continues to be at the forefront of a digital world that is constantly changing as Meta invests in building the internet's future by pushing boundaries, igniting debate, and remaining true to his original mission of connecting people. college interview student teacher high school About the Creator RA RAJ ADHIKARI Reader insights Be the first to share your insights about this piece.

The behavioral approach includes that autism and other learning disabilities involve behavioral deficits and excesses that can be treated with specific treatments. These treatments focus on teaching small, measurable units of behavior systematically. Every skill a child does not demonstrate, from simple to complex acts, is broken into specific steps (American Psychological Association, 1994 and Lovaas, 1993, 1996 & 1997).
