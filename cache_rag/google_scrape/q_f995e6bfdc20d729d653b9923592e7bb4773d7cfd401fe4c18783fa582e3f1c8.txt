Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. While a superstar quarterback at Texas A&M , Johnny Manziel hit rock-bottom at one point during his collegiate career. However, if the former Heisman Trophy winner never experienced being arrested prior to the 2012 season, he believes his success never would have came. During the first episode of his " Ball Don’t Lie " podcast, Manziel said that his June 2012 arrest impacted his redshirt freshman year.

I outrushed Todd Gurley in the SEC. Nuts. My redshirt freshman year, the year I won the Heisman," Manziel explained. He continued: "I believe all that was directly correlated to me running those sprints at the beginning of the year and being in the dumbest shape on the team. ... Without a doubt. I got punished and I won a Heisman for it. It's crazy. The bad doesn't always turn out so bad down the line."
