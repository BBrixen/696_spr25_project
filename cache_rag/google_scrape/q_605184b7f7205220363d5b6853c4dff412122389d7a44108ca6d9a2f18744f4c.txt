Fernandes clipped the ball into the net in the 52nd minute, ending Spain's run of 12 consecutive wins and handing the Spanish team its second loss in 50 games. Spain's only other loss during the stretch was to the United States at the Confederations Cup in South Africa last year. Spain outshot the Swiss 24-8 and held the ball 63 percent of the time, but it could find no way through Switzerland's determined defense. It was Switzerland's first win over Spain. Need a break?
