I received an email notifying me about the price increase. YouTube is cheaper than Netflix, and there isn‚Äôt a real competitor, so I decided to stick with it because my dad hates watching ads during the news. I, on the other hand, enjoy the ads. üôÉ  Anyway, the email said "Action Required" but there was no CTA for me to action on.   So, I went on with my life.  A couple of days before the renewal date, they sent me a notification via Google Play Store (not in the YouTube app!) that I needed to agree to the new payment. Otherwise, it was a default opt-out. Yikes.   I almost missed the notification but eventually opened the app and opted in.  Then, they asked me to reverify my payment method, so I took a few minutes to do that too.  Phew. I thought I was all set.  But I wasn‚Äôt.  My dad asked, ‚ÄúHey Khushi, why am I seeing ads on YouTube? I thought we paid them, right?‚Äù  I thought so too. I wondered if there was a bug where my payment was deducted but the subscription didn‚Äôt renew.  I checked my bank account, and the payment hadn‚Äôt been deducted‚Äîit was a ‚Äòfailed payment.‚Äô  Again, no emails, no in-app messages, no paywalls.  We had to restart our subscription with YouTube as if we were first-time customers. Was the additional 20% revenue worth the trouble for YouTube?   Google Play Store handles subscriptions for millions of apps. This is the livelihood of so many people. They need to do better. A 5% monthly churn means you lose half of your customers annually.  Voluntary churn happens when users actively cancel a subscription. They leave feedback, and you can try to retain them with clever segmentation.  Involuntary churn, however, is silent. These users likely want to stay.  Payments fail for two reasons: hard declines and soft declines.  Hard declines, like expired cards, mean you can‚Äôt retry the payment, and the customer must enter a new card.  Soft declines, such as insufficient funds or ‚Äúdo not honor,‚Äù can be retried within certain limits. Mastercard allows 35 attempts, and Visa allows 15 within 30 days. Exceeding these limits can lead to fines as high as $15,000.  There's a better way to handle involuntary churn: - Dunning emails and SMS: YouTube should have sent notifications about the failed payment and next steps. - Precision retries: For soft declines, they should have retried the payment a few times. - In-app walls: The YouTube app should display payment failure messages or paywalls, but I saw none. - In-line card updates: YouTube should allow the same card on multiple accounts and make updating card details easier. Don‚Äôt make users jump through hoops. - Default opt-in: Don‚Äôt cancel subscriptions just because prices go up.  Churnkey has a free Churn Metrics product that shows what percentage of your churn is due to involuntary churn. It works with Stripe, Paddle, and Chargebee.

I feel like this glaring oversight probably happened because the PMs at such huge corporates usually work in silos, and for immediate changes such as this, bureaucratic processes within the org can lead to delayed communication between the Product Team handling subscriptions and the rest of company Like Reply 1¬†Reaction 2¬†Reactions See more comments To view or add a comment, sign in More Relevant Posts Jagadeesh J.

Usually reported in - Google Others-, it was $5.13Bn in Q2 2020.   In the latest quarterly earnings report, this number was reported under the "Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices." This number is $9.31Bn.  Interestingly, this number is more than the revenue from YouTube ads reported by Google for the last quarter.  Here is the interesting math on this number.  YouTube premium costs between $1 and $18 monthly in different countries.  Let's take a modest $5 average monthly subscription per user.  If we divide this number by Google YouTube subscription revenue($9.31Bn) from last quarter, we get 620 million active YouTube subscriptions.  62 Crores users.   YouTube has approximately 250 Crores and active users.  This means one in four YouTube users is a premium user today.  They are probably the people who do other online purchases, too.

It made me wonder: is Google ‚Äì a company that has conditioned us to expect everything for free ‚Äì becoming a subscription business? It's a pretty robust part of Google's balance sheet these days, and one that execs have started talking more about, especially as they hope to get you all to pay subs for their flashy new AI features... #google #alphabet #subscriptions #ads Google is becoming a subscription company businessinsider.com 42 2 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Kelsey McCormick I help creative service providers superbloom their sales with marketing campaigns + Launch Consultant for D2C brands + Keynote Speaker and Host üéôÔ∏è @cominguproses.co 6mo Report this post YouTube's first launch was a total flop, but it led to creating the world's largest video platform.  Back in 2005, three PayPal employees launched a video dating site called 'Tune In Hook Up'. Spoiler alert: it bombed.  Instead of giving up, they paid attention to how people were actually using their platform. Turns out, folks were uploading all sorts of videos, not just dating profiles.  They pivoted to general video sharing, & within a year, Google bought YouTube for $1.65b. Now, it has over 2 billion monthly active users.  For service providers looking to launch their offers, this shows the power of launching. Even if the first one doesn't hit ‚Äî it's still a massive win.  Why? Because it gives you SO MUCH INSIGHT into what your audience actually needs / desires that you simply will not get otherwise.  Every single brand you know has had a launch or marketing campaign ‚Äúfail"  But the truth is...  The only real failure is not launching at all. 4 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Glenn Gabe President of G-Squared Interactive LLC 12mo Report this post $80.5B -> Alphabet Q1 earnings: Revenue up 15% YoY to $80.5B, net income up 57% to $23.7B, YouTube revenue of $8B, Google Cloud revenue up 28% to $9.6B, and headcount down 5%+; GOOG up 13%+ after hours  And YouTube is a beast -> YouTube's Q1 ad revenue climbs 21% YoY to $8.1B, vs. $7.72B estimated, its highest Q1 total to date  "That figure doesn‚Äôt include subscription revenue generated by YouTube.

(Stock up ~20% YTD)  The wins:   1. Record Cloud Revenues: Google Cloud made over $10 billion in quarterly revenues for the first time, with $1 billion quarterly operating profit. This marks a 29% year-on-year increase in cloud revenues.  2. AI Innovation:  More than 2 million developers are using Google's AI tools, contributing billions in AI-related revenues. The Gemini AI model family, used in products like Search and Workspace, has enhanced capabilities with 2 million tokens, the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model.  3. YouTube Growth: YouTube ads revenue grew by 13% year-on-year, reaching $8.7 billion, driven by strong brand advertising and a significant rise in YouTube Shorts and Connected TV views. YouTube remains the No. 1 streaming platform in the U.S.   4. Search Momentum: Google's search capabilities, enhanced by AI Overviews, saw increased engagement, particularly among younger users aged 18-24. Search and other advertising revenues grew by 14%, hitting $48.5 billion, with retail and financial services leading the growth.  5. Tech Infrastructure Investments: Google is heavily investing in its AI and cloud infrastructure. The launch of the sixth-generation TPU, Trillium, offers a near 5x increase in peak compute performance and 67% more energy efficiency compared to previous versions. Google also announced new data centers and cloud regions in Malaysia, Iowa, Virginia, and Ohio.  6. Subscription Strength: YouTube saw a 14% increase in subscription, platforms, and devices revenues, totaling $9.3 billion. This growth was driven by YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium, along with Google One.  The challenges:   1. Network Revenues Decline: Network advertising revenues fell by 5% year-on-year.   2. Increased Expenses: Total cost of revenues increased by 11% to $35.5 billion, driven by higher content acquisition costs, depreciation, and the impact of the Canadian Digital Services Tax.  3. Operating Expenses: Operating expenses rose by 5% to $21.8 billion, with significant increases in R&D costs primarily due to compensation and depreciation.  4. Real Estate and Technical Infrastructure Costs: Ongoing strategic investments in technical infrastructure and real estate are adding to expenses.  5. Subscription Growth Deceleration: Although subscription revenues grew, the year-on-year growth rate decelerated due to the anniversary of a YouTube TV price increase, suggesting that sustaining high growth rates in this segment may be challenging.  6. Cloud Profitability and Seasonal Patterns: Despite reaching a $1 billion quarterly operating profit, Google Cloud's margins are expected to follow a seasonal pattern with potential declines in Q3 due to increased expenses associated with technical infrastructure investments. 7 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Gabriel Wolff Sales Enablement & Performance Marketing | Managing Director @ Everything Bagel 10mo Report this post ROAS = WRONG üò¢   Most users DO NOT üî¥ see your ad, and immediately buy from you:  They'll see 1 ad from you, then another from a competitor, then your organic social, then talk to a friend, then go to the store, then go to Amazon, then see a Youtube video, then read a review, then sign up for your email, then see another ad from you, then....üòµ   And this is the point - ROAS is a guess as to which ad had the most contribution to a user becoming a customer, and is only confined to the platform or model you are using (they're all flawed).

On Wiza 's 5th birthday everything changed.  9/10 SaaS founders will say facebook ads are a waste of money, and they‚Äôre right.  But the truth is, we didn‚Äôt stop spending on Facebook.  In fact, we are spending 4x more.  The only difference is, now I am also contributing to my own piggy bank.  But how did we get here?  This path wasn‚Äôt clear from the beginning; I was HYPER skeptical But looking back on the last 6 months, I connected the dots.  Here‚Äôs the 3 things we did to; ‚Ä¢ Increase SQL‚Äôs by 620% ‚Ä¢ Decrease our CAC payback by 30% ‚Ä¢ Increase our conversion rate of free-trial signups by 22%  Focused on creative more than tactics  We decided to obsess about our ad creative. For months I would scroll through Foreplay.co every morning and every night.  This triggered an impactful chain reaction.  We had more ad ideas then we could execute on, backed by performance metrics. We went from testing 3-5 new ads a month to 10-20 new ads a week. (Throwing sh*t at the wall is where the froth is - but we didn‚Äôt have ideas)  ‚ÄúOptimized‚Äù our Mobile Funnel 99% of the Facebook ad inventory is on mobile ‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt really use our product on mobile and you still can‚Äôt.  The simple fix wasn‚Äôt to build a mobile app - no one does real prospecting from their iPhone. We simply communicated and managed expectations through the signup flow.  We also added a specific email to our welcome series for those who signed up on mobile.  And most importantly‚Ä¶  Hired a captain to steer the ship.  6 months ago Michael Kilcullen joined our team as a VP of marketing. Looking back on past failures many of them come back to focus and attention.  We used to sling, spray and pray.  Now with someone at the helm we are getting better every day - not simply making mistakes but learning from them and turning the learnings into action. That‚Äôs about it, we turned our Zuck Tax into an investment with a healthy payback.  I hope you can do the same. 46 5 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in 3,087 followers 43 Posts View Profile Connect Explore topics Sales Marketing IT Services Business Administration HR Management Engineering Soft Skills See All LinkedIn ¬© 2025 About Accessibility User Agreement Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Choices Cookie Policy Copyright Policy Brand Policy Guest Controls Community Guidelines ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© (Arabic) ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ (Bangla) ƒåe≈°tina (Czech) Dansk (Danish) Deutsch (German) ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ (Greek) English (English) Espa√±ol (Spanish) ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å (Persian) Suomi (Finnish) Fran√ßais (French) ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä (Hindi) Magyar (Hungarian) Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) Italiano (Italian) ◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ (Hebrew) Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (Japanese) ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (Korean) ‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§†‡•Ä (Marathi) Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) Nederlands (Dutch) Norsk (Norwegian) ‡®™‡©∞‡®ú‡®æ‡®¨‡©Ä (Punjabi) Polski (Polish) Portugu√™s (Portuguese) Rom√¢nƒÉ (Romanian) –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (Russian) Svenska (Swedish) ‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±Å (Telugu) ‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ (Thai) Tagalog (Tagalog) T√ºrk√ße (Turkish) –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ (Ukrainian) Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát (Vietnamese) ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Simplified)) Ê≠£È´î‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Traditional)) Language Sign in to view more content Create your free account or sign in to continue your search Sign in Welcome back Email or phone Password Show Forgot password?
