He invested $30 million into Tesla, became the chairman of its Board of Directors, and helped raise money from Google’s founders several years later. The prototype for the Tesla Roadster, the company’s first electric car, was unveiled in 2006 and entered production in 2008.  Through June 2009, 500 Roadsters were sold for $98,000 apiece . In 2017, Tesla tapped into the mainstream market by launching its Model 3 vehicle, which became the world’s most popular plug-in electric car in 2020, with worldwide unit sales of roughly 501,000 in 2021. Between January and March 2022, Tesla broke its own delivery record, when its car deliveries crossed the 310,000-unit threshold. Tesla Earnings 💰💹 Interested to see how Tesla is currently performing?

Tesla Q2 2024 Deliveries Report Copied Copy To Clipboard Tesla shares jumped by more than 7% on Tuesday, July 2, after the electric vehicle giant reported its latest quarterly delivery numbers, topping consensus expectations. In the second quarter, Tesla produced approximately 410,831 vehicles and delivered approximately 443,956 vehicles, above the analyst consensus expectation of 439,302 deliveries. The quarter saw Tesla produce 386,576 Model 3/Y vehicles, delivering 422,405. Tesla shares hit a high of $226.66 on the news. “The better-than-expected Q2 deliveries are not only a breath of fresh air for Tesla’s margins but also for the EV market as a whole,” said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. “Although these numbers were naturally buoyed by strong auto demand in the US in general — GM’s sales, out just a few moments ago, are another testament to that — the fact that the biggest EV maker in the world managed to deliver 15% more cars in Q2 than in Q1 indicates that the EV play is not dead at all, as several analysts were quick to point out a few months ago. “Still, deliveries only did enough to support the ongoing rally. Although they remain far from being the main catalyst for the company at this point,” he continued. “The real story here for investors is on the technology front, with both the humanoid robot and the Robotaxi stories developing at an exciting pace. Both, particularly when combined, have the potential to become absolute game-changers for the company’s margins, leading to the type of sales Tesla shareholders expect.” What Is Tesla’s Annual Revenue? Copied Copy To Clipboard Tesla earned $53.8 billion in sales revenue in 2021. This was up from $31.5 billion earned in 2020, with a 70.64% growth in sales during 2021. In 2022, Tesla remains the largest EV manufacturer in terms of revenue and market share, followed by Volkswagen. Tesla sold more than 310,000 vehicles in Q1, 2022, and its vehicle deliveries amounted to 254,700 units in Q2, 2022. Tesla’s revenue for the quarter ending June 30, 2022, was $16.934 billion, a 41.61% increase year-over-year. Tesla’s revenue for the twelve months ending June 30, 2022, was $67.166 billion , a 60.45% increase year-over-year. Tesla’s revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $21.454 billion, while in the fourth quarter year it earned $24.32 billion, constituting an increase of 37.24% year-over-year. Its revenue for the twelve months ending December 31, 2022, was $81.462 billion, which amounts to a 51.35% growth year-over-year. In 2022, the company’s hourly revenue amounted to $8,703,704; in 2012, it made ‘only’ $13,981 per hour. Year (since 2009) Annual Revenue (Millions of US $) 2009 $112 2010 $117 2011 $204 2012 $413 2013 $2,013 2014 $3,198 2015 $4,046 2016 $7,000 2017 $11,759 2018 $21,461 2019 $24,578 2020 $31,536 2021 $53,823 2022 $81,462 Tesla Q3 2024 Earnings Copied Copy To Clipboard Tesla reported its 2024 third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, October 23, with EPS of $0.72, $0.12 better than the analyst estimate of $0.60. Revenue for the quarter came in at $25.18B versus the consensus estimate of $25.4B. “It’s great to see Tesla getting down to business when it really matters. Although macro factors such as improving demand in China and a resilient US consumer undoubtedly contributed to the positive report, they do not tell the whole story here; in fact, the improving numbers across the board signal the company may have finally found a nice sweet spot for the pricing vs. production costs equation, which has been the main issue for stock performance since last year,” said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. “While automotive regulatory credit revenue certainly played a significant role in boosting margins, it’s important to note that several other factors, such as sales and energy generation, are contributing to a more diversified revenue base. “Against this backdrop, the market got the message it needed to hear: Tesla’s margins are improving right when they needed to – that is, ahead of a better interest environment globally. This means the company may have more firepower to get the innovation it desperately needs both on the production and product sides faster and better than the competition,” he continued. “Overall, the report also diminishes the urgency for a cheaper model as Musk and Co seem to have – at least for now – found a nice solution for some of the more pressing issues in the core business.” Source: InvestingPro Tesla’s Achievements in 2022 Copied Copy To Clipboard While other automakers delivered their worst sales figures in a decade, Tesla’s delivery statistics were praiseworthy in 2022. The company delivered 1,313,851 vehicles to customers worldwide and, in so doing, increased its deliveries by 40% in comparison to the previous year. It also produced 47% more cars in 2022 compared to 2021. By selling 491,000 vehicles in America, Tesla won the US luxury sales leader title. It left behind BMW, which had worn this crown for the last three years but sold only 332,388 cars in the United States in 2022 and was thus relegated to second place. With 286,764 cars sold, Mercedez-Benz came third, followed by Lexus, whose sales totaled 258,704 vehicles in 2022. And not only did Tesla outshine these brands, but it also became the first American automaker to top the list in a quarter century. There is also another point to Tesla’s credit. Because Tesla produces its cars on American soil, in California and Texas, it strengthens American automaking. With Elon Musk, American car manufacturing has made a spectacular comeback. In 2022, Tesla also expanded its international factories. In March, the first Tesla vehicles were produced in Germany at the newly opened Giga Berlin. Musk’s idea is to turn Giga Berlin into a European crown jewel. The factory in China was also updated to manufacture as many as 750,000 Model 3 and Model Y electric cars annually. During 2022, Tesla installed the capacity, across all of its factories, to produce 100,000 Model S and X vehicles per year, together with 1.8 million Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. In late 2022, Tesla cut prices on its cars around the world. Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom became less expensive. By enabling more people to purchase its cars, Tesla accelerated the world’s transition to sustainable energy.

Analysts predict that Tesla’s rapid growth can accelerate in the third quarter and beyond. Speaking at the annual shareholder meeting, Elon Musk mentioned the company’s future production plans, saying that by the end of 2022, Tesla might reach an annual production run rate of 2 million vehicles : “We’re aiming to achieve a 2 million vehicle run-rate by the end of the year… Thanks to the hard work of the Tesla team, we’ve already been able to achieve a 1.5 million unit annualized run rate. And depending on how the rest of this year goes, I think we might get close to, or will get approximately at the 1.5 million mark, and will be exiting the year at a 2 million-unit run-rate,” Musk said. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Tesla delivered nearly 405,300 units. Its quarterly deliveries grew by 17.87% during this quarter, compared to the same quarter of 2021. Between November and December 2022, Tesla’s deliveries crossed the 405,000 unit mark, setting a new record. The deliveries in the third quarter of 2022 totaled 343,000.

The company also said that the factory in Shanghai allows it to manufacture 750,000 Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles a year. The production capacity of Tesla’s factory in California lets it annually make 100,000 more expensive Model S and Model X cars together with 550,000 of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. The company’s Texas factory can produce 250,000 Model Y vehicles annually, and so can its factory in Germany. Tesla’s 2022 Year-End Vehicle Production and Delivery Copied Copy To Clipboard Tesla opened the new year by publishing its fourth-quarter vehicle production and 2022 delivery report on January 3, 2023. Total annual deliveries reached a new record of 1.31 million, increasing by 47% compared to the last year. Total annual production hit 1.37 million. The most popular vehicle of the year proved Model 3s, comprising over 95% of produced and delivered cars. The Q4 deliveries and production could have been more impressive. Their numbers fell short of analysts’ consensus, who expected Tesla to deliver around 427,000 cars. Contrary to analysts’ predictions, Tesla delivered 405,278 vehicles and produced 439,000 cars in the fourth quarter. The period ending December 31, 2022, was challenging for the company because of Covid outbreaks in China, leading to reduced production at its Shanghai factory. Yet Elon Musk sounded optimistic when he said he expected to achieve “50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon.” How Many Tesla Vehicles Are Sold by Country?

Considering that in 2011, TSLA shares cost a mere $4.92 , the company has done exceptionally well since its inception. Although Tesla faces tough competition from other automakers, some of its EVs are on top of the electric vehicle market. It is the only company that simultaneously has several top-selling cars, such as Tesla Model Y ( 32.9% market share) and Tesla Model 3 ( 22.6% ) and, therefore, might easily outclass and outsell other producers of electric vehicles.
