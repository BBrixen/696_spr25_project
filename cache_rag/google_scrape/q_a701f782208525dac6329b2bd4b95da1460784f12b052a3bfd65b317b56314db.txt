It wasn’t a great final, but Djokovic won’t care. He’s back and it’s unlikely he’s going to stop here. Expect him to go on a big run during the US hardcourt season. Watch out! The US Open comes next. But Wimbledon 2018 is over. Thanks for reading and emailing over the past fortnight. Bye! Novak Djokovic seals fourth Wimbledon title in final stroll over Kevin Anderson Read more Share Updated at 12.05 EDT 15 Jul 2018 11.43 EDT A grinning Novak Djokovic starts by paying tribute to his young son, Stefan. “It feels amazing because for the first time in my life I have someone screaming ‘daddy, daddy’ and it’s a little boy right there. He’s under five years old, so he couldn’t watch the matches live but we hoped if I lifted the trophy he could be there. I’m very emotional and happy for my wife and my whole team. He was by far the best sparring partner I had in the last couple of weeks. But I would just like to congratulate Kevin. He has had quite a few hours in quarter-finals and semi-finals. In his first Wimbledon final he didn’t play well in the first two sets, but he was a better player in the third set and I was happy to come through. I owe a great thanks to my team. The last couple of years haven’t been easy. I had surgery and was absent from the tour for six months. This was my first grand slam final after a couple of years. There was no better place to make my comeback. This is a sacred place for tennis. I always dreamed of holding this trophy when I was a young boy. The grass tasted really good. I had a double portion this year.” Share 15 Jul 2018 11.38 EDT Novak Djokovic walks up to collect his trophy. “Playing against Novak isn’t easy,” Kevin Anderson says. “Congratulations to him. I’m not feeling as fresh now as I was coming into the week. But this is an amazing tournament for all of us. That’s what it had to take for me to get here. I would have given another 21 hours to have the opportunity to play out here.” Share 15 Jul 2018 11.34 EDT Small consolation for Anderson, but he'll break into the top 5 for the first time in his career. Great tournament for him but that Isner-epic really did destroy his chances.

Djokovic’s mentality isn’t good at the moment, while Anderson’s desperately fighting. He charges forward and dinks a backhand past Djokovic for 0-30. Djokovic responds with a pinpoint serve down the middle. But then he pulls a forehand wide. It’s 15-40! Two set points! Anderson nets a forehand return on the first. Another serve down the middle allows Djokovic to move forward and punch a forehand into the left corner for deuce. Brilliant serving. But Anderson’s forehand is causing problems. A howitzer brings up another set point. Djokovic stays calm. He takes 32.7 seconds to serve. Then he sends one down the middle and Anderson nets his forehand. Eventually Djokovic holds with an ace. Share 15 Jul 2018 11.13 EDT Third set: Djokovic 6-2, 6-2, 5-6 Anderson* (*denotes server): Anderson’s serving much better now, holding to love. It might be too late.

Share 15 Jul 2018 11.10 EDT Third set: Djokovic* 6-2, 6-2, 5-5 Anderson (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, Djokovic double-faults at 15-0. He’s choking. He’s definitely choking. Sort of. More realistically, it’s more that Anderson has become more aggressive. At 30-15, he charges forward and pressurises Djokovic, who nets a backhand. Moments later Djokovic double-faults, handing Anderson a set point! They rally. A miscued Djokovic forehand looks like it’s dropping long. But it falls in time and Djokovic eventually moves forward to prod the ball over the net for deuce. The punters were cheering when it looked like that forehand was going long. “Shut the fuck up!” Djokovic shouts. He’s edgy. Another double-fault gives Anderson a second chance. Djokovic whips a stinging forehand into the right corner for deuce. Anderson loses the point when he wallops a forehand wide. He uses up his last challenge. Djokovic holds. “No!” Anderson cries.

He has a bit of a spring in his step at the moment. Djokovic serves well to make it 30-15, but Anderson finds the line with a fine forehand. It’s called out, but the umpire overrules it. Djokovic challenges in vain. 30-all. Moments later Anderson benefits from a lucky net cord with a backhand. He has a break point! He ... knocks a backhand long! Oh Kevin! How could you? Eventually Djokovic holds. He roars, a sign he wants to keep his intensity as high as possible. Share 15 Jul 2018 10.51 EDT Third set: Djokovic 6-2, 6-2, 3-4 Anderson* (*denotes server): Anderson bangs an ace down the middle for 15-0. Someone in the crowd swigs from a bottle of champagne. Give that person a racket and let them play a few games. Anderson holds to 15. Another hold. Suddenly I’m worried we’re still going to be here at 11pm. Share 15 Jul 2018 10.47 EDT Third set: Djokovic* 6-2, 6-2, 3-3 Anderson (*denotes server): Djokovic drills a backhand down the line to move to 30-0. Good shot, Novak. He holds to love. “There have been plenty of one-sided finals down the years,” Craig McEwan. “Jimmy Connors crushing Ken Rosewall 6-1 6-1 6-4 in 1974 is the first I remember. There have been others.” Hewitt v Nalbandian in 2002 was bad.

Nope? This is painful to watch. — Monk The Monkey (@B01_1Ya) July 15, 2018 Share 15 Jul 2018 10.36 EDT Third set: Djokovic 6-2, 6-2, 1-2 Anderson* (*denotes server): The first two points are shared. Djokovic has just dipped a little. He sends a forehand long to hand Anderson a 40-15 lead and hangs his head. Anderson clobbers a forehand into the right corner to hold. These are baby steps. Very painful baby steps. Share 15 Jul 2018 10.33 EDT Third set: Djokovic* 6-2, 6-2, 1-1 Anderson (*denotes server): Djokovic holds easily. The only way to salvage this now is to get it done before the football starts. Share 15 Jul 2018 10.30 EDT Third set: Djokovic 6-2, 6-2, 0-1 Anderson* (*denotes server): My colleague Sean Ingle has just walked in from Centre Court. “Not exactly a classic, is it?” he says. Sean is also bias against Djokovic. Get him, Paul and Cassandra! Share 15 Jul 2018 10.24 EDT Novak Djokovic wins the second set 6-2; he leads 6-2, 6-2! Djokovic is serving for the set. He makes it 30-0 when Anderson wonks another sad forehand wide. There’s some brief light entertainment when Djokovic returns a smash and Anderson wins the point with a lovely drop volley for 30-15. Suddenly Anderson’s moving like Usain Bolt! He wrongfoots Djokovic with a backhand behind him for 30-all! The comeback’s on! Moments later Djokovic fires a forehand down the line wide and Anderson has his first break point! After 70 minutes, the final has started! Sort of. Anderson drifts a slice long. Deuce. Djokovic rams a backhand down the line to earn a set point. He pings a big serve out wide and Anderson’s backhand return goes wide. Will this be over before the World Cup final starts? “The unending final set is the tennis version of natural selection,” Adam Hirst says. “The way to weed out all the big servers to prevent them from actually winning the thing. We should all be thankful.” View image in fullscreen Djokovic wins the second set 6-2. Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images Share Updated at 10.26 EDT 15 Jul 2018 10.17 EDT Second set: Djokovic 6-2, 5-2 Anderson* (*denotes server): Anderson knocks a forehand down the line to hold to 15. Djokovic will serve for a two-set lead. “Shame, but it was obvious this was going to happen to the winner of Anderson-Isner,” Gregory Phillips. “Even with an extra day’s rest, Anderson had still played almost an entire match worth of games more than Djokovic in his semi. I had always been against fifth-set tiebreakers but this year has made a believer out of me. Question is, should it at 6-6 or a higher number in a fifth set? I’m thinking 9-9.” Anderson and Isner both suggested 12-12 would be a good compromise on Friday night. That’s another set. If it’s not settled by then, anything more seems unnecessary. Share 15 Jul 2018 10.13 EDT Second set: Djokovic* 6-2, 5-1 Anderson (*denotes server): Anderson beat the blessed Roger and went through a marathon semi-final just to treat us to this. I’m proposing a life-time ban from the All England Club, even though he’s a lovely guy and a good tennis player when his feet aren’t made out of lead and his legs aren’t made out of jelly. “This is indeed the worst Wimbledon final I’ve ever seen,” Adithya says. “Federer vs Cilic last year was equally one-sided, but at least Federer was hitting a good number of clean winners. All Djokovic has to do here is move Anderson from side to side and watch him miss make-able shots by a mile. The only consolation is that this might not even clash with the World Cup final, which will hopefully be a lot better.” Share 15 Jul 2018 10.06 EDT Second set: Djokovic 6-2, 4-1 Anderson* (*denotes server): An Anderson backhand’s called long on the first point. A challenge shows it clipped the line. But 15-0 becomes 15-30 after two more errors. Anderson double-faults. Two break points. Anderson whacks a forehand miles long. Djokovic breaks again. Is Federer still in London? Can he come and play an exhibition when this is done in 20 minutes? View image in fullscreen Djokovic breaks serve. Photograph: Tony O'Brien/Reuters Share Updated at 10.09 EDT 15 Jul 2018 10.02 EDT Second set: Djokovic* 6-2, 3-1 Anderson (*denotes server): “ I take it that you missed Nadal’s brutal beating up of Federer in 2008 Roland Garros?” Sachin Paul says. “Or last year when Saint Roger beat up a man with blisters on his feet? Have some respect for Djokovic, who has been through a lot to get here.” Oh good, another person who wants to see non-existent bias at every turn. Don’t you ever get bored with this carry-on? The fact this is a bad final has nothing to do with Djokovic. I haven’t criticised Djokovic. It’s a bad final because one of the guys just played the longest ever semi-final and can’t move his feet. Share 15 Jul 2018 09.57 EDT Second set: Djokovic 6-2, 2-1 Anderson* (*denotes server): Anderson looks in control in 40-30. Then come a couple of wobbles; a dismal forehand makes it 40-30. Djokovic perks up. Anderson dumps another backhand long to bring it to deuce. They rally for a while and a ball falls out of Anderson’s pocket. It’s a let the first time it happens, so they replay the rally and Djokovic surprisingly nets a forehand. Anderson holds with a delightful volley and gets a big cheer from the crowd. Share 15 Jul 2018 09.50 EDT Second set: Djokovic* 6-2, 2-0 Anderson (*denotes server): This might be the worst final I’ve ever seen. Call it off. Share 15 Jul 2018 09.47 EDT Second set: Djokovic 6-2, 1-0 Anderson* (*denotes server): Anderson nets a backhand at the end of a long baseline rally. Two break points. This is a joke. Djokovic knocks a backhand long and the ball spurts off the baseline, forcing Anderson to send his riposte miles long. Djokovic pumps his fist. No mercy. He leads this final by a set and a break. Anderson has nothing in the tank. Share 15 Jul 2018 09.41 EDT Novak Djokovic wins the first set 6-2! S erving for the set, Djokovic moves into a 15-0 lead with a smash at the net. Then a fine defensive backhand forces Anderson to net a backhand slice. Two set points. Anderson slashes a forehand long and that’s that. They return to their seats and Anderson calls for the trainer, who immediately gets to work on the South African’s heavy right arm. View image in fullscreen Djokovic wins the first set 6-2. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters Share Updated at 09.43 EDT 15 Jul 2018 09.36 EDT First set: Djokovic 5-2 Anderson* (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, Anderson slaps a desperate forehand into the crowd after being given the runaround by Djokovic again. A man in one of the front rows has to duck as the ball flies towards his head. That’s quicker than Anderson’s moved so far. However, the South African steadies himself at 15-all, finding his serve to hold to 15, closing it out with an ace. Djokovic will serve for the set. Share 15 Jul 2018 09.33 EDT First set: Djokovic* 5-1 Anderson (*denotes server): Which Djokovic was better: the 2011-12 version or the 2015-16 version? The 2018 version is a game from the first set. Share 15 Jul 2018 09.31 EDT First set: Djokovic 4-1 Anderson* (*denotes server): Djokovic’s movement’s brilliant. At 0-15, he scrambles around the baseline to force Anderson to play one more short. Anderson bangs a forehand wide. He’s in trouble at 0-30. His sixth unforced forehand error hands Djokovic two break points. Anderson’s on the ropes every time they’re in a baseline rally. He slaps a forehand deep and approaches the net. Djokovic pings a low backhand from left to right, down by Anderson’s feet, and the South African can’t lower his creaking frame in time to do anything with his volley. This set could be over soon.

What a guy! I see what Cassandra Gyamsto means now. He holds to 15 and then he starts a trust fund for the duckling. Share 15 Jul 2018 09.21 EDT First set: Djokovic 2-1 Anderson* (*denotes server): Anderson crashes a 137mph past Djokovic to take a 40-0 lead. That’s better. Another big serve gets the big man on the scoreboard. “We know you dislike Novak, but try and keep your bias to yourself and give us factual live updates,” Cassandra Gyamsto says. “It’s unpleasant how you show your obvious hatred for him. You can be better than that.” Thank you, Cassandra. Do you have any life advice you’d like to hand down from your high horse? Share 15 Jul 2018 09.19 EDT First set: Djokovic* 2-0 Anderson (*denotes server): There’s quite a low-key atmosphere on Centre Court. Perhaps they fear this is going to be a rout. Not that it would bother them if it was the blessed Roger doing the routing. Djokovic consolidates the break with a hold to 15. Anderson isn’t moving well enough. He’s trying to gee himself up. He knows he’s passive. Share 15 Jul 2018 09.15 EDT First set: Djokovic 1-0 Anderson* (*denotes server): “Sit back and enjoy it,” Sue Barker says on the BBC. “As we join Andrew Castle.” Sue, how could we possibly not enjoy listening to one of LBC’s finest? You spoil us. Just when we thought things couldn’t get better. Now the final can begin! Kevin Anderson, the eighth seed, opens the serving in his first Wimbledon final and he moves into a 30-15 lead with a deft volley. But two bad shots hand Novak Djokovic an early break point. This is a nervy start from the South African. Djokovic is getting those serves back and that’s unsettled Anderson, who finds himself a break down after three minutes when he double-faults. Oh dear. View image in fullscreen Djokovic returns. Photograph: John Walton/PA Share Updated at 09.22 EDT 15 Jul 2018 09.07 EDT “Do you think Anderson can make a good contest of the match today?” David Wall says. “Often in recent years at Wimbledon when there has been a surprise finalist against one of the ‘big four’, they have capitulated in the final (often despite having beaten another of that foursome in getting there). I think the finals involving cilic, raonic, berdych, etc were all anti climactic straight set victories for Federer, Murray, and Nadal respectively, weren’t they? Is there good reason to think Anderson won’t go the same way so we will get a good final?” If he’s not completely knackered, I think Anderson has shown he has the serve to inconvenience anyone. He’s 32, he’s level-headed and he’s been in a final before. Djokovic is the massive favourite, but there’s reason to be hopeful. Share 15 Jul 2018 09.05 EDT Time for the coin toss, some pictures and a warm-up . Tok! Tok! Tok! We’ll have some tennis soon. I wonder who the crowd will be supporting today. Novak Djokovic has never really felt the love here – they wanted Rafa Nadal to win yesterday - and Kevin Anderson is the underdog. Anderson is hard not to like. The man slipped and played a left-handed forehand in his win over John Isner! Share 15 Jul 2018 09.03 EDT The players are going on that long, winding walk through the corridors of Centre Court. They pass so many reminders of history on their journey. It must feel like it goes on for ever. What must go through their minds? The nerves must be huge, especially for Kevin Anderson, who’s never done this before. Novak Djokovic , mind you, has a big grin on his face as he strides out. He must be pleased to see William and Kate in the Royal Box. That’ll explain his sunny mood. Share 15 Jul 2018 08.54 EDT Share 15 Jul 2018 08.46 EDT This is the first time since beating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the 2008 Australian Open that Novak Djokovic hasn’t faced a member of the Big Four or Stan Wawrinka in a grand slam final. He’s played Roger Federer four times, Andy Murray seven times, Rafael Nadal seven times and Wawrinka twice. He’s won those 12 titles the hard way. Share 15 Jul 2018 08.37 EDT Kevin Anderson might take encouragement from the second of his two previous meetings with Novak Djokovic here. That was in the fourth round back in 2015. He was on the verge of causing one hell of a shock when he took a two-set lead. Yet Djokovic did his Djokovic thing, clambering back into the match before darkness fell and returning the next day to finish it off in five sets. He would go on to beat Federer in the final. Share 15 Jul 2018 08.35 EDT Novak Djokovic has won 68 titles throughout his career. Kevin Anderson has won four. Djokovic’s career earnings are $111,165,585. Anderson’s are $11,658,256.

Usually people talk about the weather when they have nothing interesting to say. But bloody hell, it’s hot at Wimbledon today. London’s heatwave has returned with a vengeance and the sun will be beating down on Centre Court when Novak Djokovic and Kevin Anderson drag their weary bodies on to the grass in an hour. Chances are they’re both going to sleep for the next month once this is all done and dusted. I’m not sure it’s been this scorching for a men’s final since Andy Murray beat Djokovic in 2013 and the conditions are bound to play a part given that both players have not had long to recover from their epic semi-finals. Anderson reached his first Wimbledon final after beating John Isner in six hours and 36 minutes - it was the second longest grand slam singles match of all time - and Djokovic sealed his spot after edging out Rafael Nadal yesterday. They’ve both got a lot of miles on the clock; most of us wouldn’t be able to pick up a racket after what they’ve put their bodies through in the past 48 hours. “My feet are sore, they’re swollen,” the 32-year-old Anderson said, speaking late on Friday night after winning his serve-off with Isner 7-6 (6), 6-7 (5), 6-7 (9), 6-4, 26-24. “The legs are jelly-like.” If they’re still wobbling this afternoon, the eighth seed probably stands no chance of claiming his first grand slam title, even though Djokovic must be drained after taking two days to beat Nadal 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (9), 3-6, 10-8. Djokovic hasn’t had long to recover from outlasting the world No1, but the Serbian is one of the fittest players around and in total has only spent 15 hours and 34 minutes on court over the fortnight. Anderson, whose thrilling comeback from two sets and match point down in his quarter-final against Roger Federer took four hours and 14 minutes, has clocked up 21 hours and 1 minute in six matches. After the scheduling issues that have dominated the conversation since Anderson and Isner went deep into a fifth set that eventually began to resemble Superman punching himself in the face for three hours, let’s just hope that this doesn’t fall flat. These championships could do with a good ending given how many of the top seeds fell early. Encouragingly, the 6ft 8in Anderson has been playing well enough to trouble anyone over the past year. The affable power server has hit 172 aces over the past fortnight and reached his first grand slam final at last year’s US Open final, losing in straight sets to Nadal. He’s grown in belief. His return game has improved and he is striking the ball with venomous intent. He could become the first South African to win the men’s title and the second African to win it since Jaroslav Drobny, who represented Egypt when he beat Ken Rosewall in 1954. He would also be the first man to win the Wimbledon title since saving match point since 1960. Anderson will require a monumental effort, though, because he’s taking on arguably the greatest returner in the history of the sport. He has a 6-1 losing record against Djokovic and the Serbian’s performance against Nadal suggests that he’s back to his fearsome best after two troubled years. Djokovic hasn’t always exuded happiness over the past two weeks - there came a point when he looked like he might flick the Vs at Kate and Meghan in the Royal Box yesterday – and it’s strange to think he’s the 12th seed given that he’s lifted this title three times. He slumped spiritually and physically after completing the career slam at Roland Garros in 2016, his aching elbow gave up on him here last year and he looked like a busted flush at the start of 2018; defeats to Hyeon Chung, Taro Daniel, Benoit Paire and Martin Klizan followed his elbow surgery and he even suggested that he might skip the grass after crashing out of the French Open to Marco Cecchinato. Yet Djokovic’s ferocious will to win, sprightly movement, stubborn defence and brilliant efficiency have all returned at SW19. Murray saw it coming, tipping Djokovic to beat Nadal during his appearance in the BBC studio on Tuesday, and it will be a huge surprise if the three-time champion, who’s back in a major final for the first time since the 2016 US Open, doesn’t claim his 13th grand slam title. Anderson is going to have to play the match of his life on Centre Court. Again. Play begins at 2pm BST.
