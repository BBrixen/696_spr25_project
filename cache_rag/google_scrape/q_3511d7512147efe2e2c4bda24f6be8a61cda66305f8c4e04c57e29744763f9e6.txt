Members Online • ChiefWatchesYouPee I hate how I feel about the USMNT recently. I feel apathetic. I should be excited about a real test for our team with a chance to make it to the knockout round. I should be thinking of different formations and strategies we can use players in if we need a goal. Instead Im not excited, I feel stuck between rooting for a win and this team advancing, or this team losing and the team getting a new coach. I hate that I feel this way but I genuinely feel a loss tonight would be better for this team in the long run and their hopes of putting on a good show in the 2026 WC. I hate what the US Soccer federation has done to this team and my excitement for US Soccer. Anyone else have similar feelings? Sorry for the downer post, hoping a few beers closer to game time will bring back some excitement and I can enjoy the game. Read more New to Reddit?
