Valhalla will be joined by other Ubisoft titles such as city-building strategy Anno 1800 and free-to-play 3v3 sports game Roller Champions. The confirmation means Ubisoft is the latest publisher to make its return to Steam after striking out on its own - or elsewhere, such as the rival Epic Games Store. We're constantly evaluating how to bring our games to different audiences wherever they are, while providing a consistent player ecosystem through Ubisoft Connect," a Ubisoft spokespeson told Eurogamer today. "Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Anno 1800 and Roller Champions are among the Ubisoft titles that will be releasing on Steam." Click to expand... Click to shrink...

People still double dip on steam even if they can play on gamepass. It's free money for Microsoft. People want to play on steam deck, or stream something, or use remote play together. pink The Fallen Oct 27, 2017 8,457 Nov 21, 2022 #30 SpartaNNNN Member Nov 12, 2020 1,495 Nov 21, 2022 #31 I am happy, EA and Ubisoft Stores run like trash Arsene no Kiseki Member Oct 25, 2017 5,581 Canada Nov 21, 2022 #32 Now release Mirage on Steam day 1 AImalexia Prophet of Truth Member Aug 31, 2021 2,426 Nov 21, 2022 #33 View: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_PPdjD6mg Lothars Banned Oct 25, 2017 9,765 Nov 21, 2022 #34 I'm happy they are finally coming back.

If Epic stopped paying they have nothing to lose by coming back to Steam.
