Founded in September 1998, Google has grown tremendously in just over 20 years. Among many factors of its success, acquiring as many as 224 companies has been extremely effective. If every business area had to be approached by starting from scratch with research and development, it would take too long. Instead, Google was able to accelerate its growth by evaluating and acquiring startups and SMEs that had already completed their R&D. Whether large or small, each company has its own organizational culture, making such acquisitions challenging. From left: YouTube founders — Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, Jawed Karim Nate Nead of the U.S. discusses Google’s relatively successful acquisition strategy: First, the most important consideration for Google when acquiring is whether the target company fits with what Google aims to achieve, meaning whether the directions of the two companies align. Second, Google tends to look for founders or managers with a strong entrepreneurial spirit. What matters here is whether there is a cultural fit and whether mutual values can be maximized. Third, one out of every three companies acquired by Google did not turn out as planned. Nonetheless, Google’s organizational culture, which embraces such risks and moves forward, has played a crucial role. This means they are willing to undertake acquisitions despite the possibility of failure and do their best. One of the successful acquisitions by Google has been YouTube. As of 2022, YouTube accounted for 11 percent of Alphabet’s $191 billion revenue. Google announced the acquisition of YouTube on October 9, 2006, and the deal was finalized on November 13 of that year. The purchase price was $1.65 billion, making it the second-largest acquisition Google had made at the time. Currently, YouTube is estimated to be worth about $230 billion. Founded on February 14, 2005, YouTube was acquired by the giant Google in just one year. At the time, Microsoft, Viacom, Yahoo, and News Corporation were also in the running to acquire YouTube, but YouTube chose Google. Sequoia Capital, a well-known American venture capital firm that had recognized Google’s value early on, also invested early in YouTube, contributing $11.5 million and owning about 30% of the company. Sequoia was the only venture capital firm to invest in YouTube initially, and its stake was valued at $495 million following Google’s acquisition. The founders of YouTube emphasized ‘independence,’ ‘identity,’ and ‘preservation of organizational culture’ upon accepting Google’s deal. Although Google had undergone many acquisitions, YouTube also strongly believed in maintaining its entrepreneurial spirit and unique corporate culture and characteristics for success. That is, Google could not come in and disrupt YouTube just because it had been acquired. The YouTube founders believed that to continue their successful formula from the early days, they needed to maintain their unique DNA, which proved to be correct. Google trusted and respected their convictions, leading to the great success we see today. However, merging two different companies is never easy, emphasizing the importance of corporate culture. In cultures that perceive acquisitions as hierarchical, the acquiring company becomes the dominant party, often trying to impose its will on the acquired company. In South Korea, there have been cases where a medium-sized company acquired a small startup, but due to oppressive behavior from the larger company, the startup’s founders and key talents resigned, leaving only a shell of the original company. Logically, if a startup is believed to be performing well and is then acquired, only for all key personnel to resign, the acquisition becomes meaningless. Of course, if the acquired startup faces internal issues post-acquisition that require intervention from the acquiring company, some level of ‘internal interference’ is inevitable. If not, it is generally better to respect the culture and methods of the acquired company as much as possible. This allows the company to grow on its terms, though it is not easy. Therefore, like in a relationship, it is essential for companies that seem compatible to take time to get to know each other well. Finding a Merger Partner Is Similar to Finding a Marriage Partner The process of finding a merger partner is similar to finding a marriage partner, as discussed in an article in GQ magazine titled ‘Eight Secrets to Finding the Right Marriage Partner.’ The points mentioned in the article are surprisingly similar to those considered during mergers and acquisitions: 1. Thoroughly examine the history of the company to be acquired or merged. 2. Be prepared for the merger or acquisition. 3. The compatibility of the leaders is crucial — it is too difficult to collaborate purely for profit if being together is disagreeable. 4. Focus should be on what can be achieved together. 5. Deeply understand each other, and if it seems increasingly unsuitable as discussions progress, be prepared to stop and abandon the process at any time. 6. Do not have excessive expectations — high expectations can lead to significant disappointments. 7. Ensure good communication — if communication fails, the likelihood of failure increases, regardless of other matching conditions. 8. Have a trial period — instead of jumping in immediately, it is better to gradually understand through partnership. Was the merger between Germany’s Daimler-Benz and America’s Chrysler a failure? Logically, the merger between Germany’s Daimler-Benz and America’s Chrysler seemed like it would generate tremendous synergy. However, the more the negotiations proceeded, the more apparent the vast differences in corporate and national cultures between Germany and the U.S. became. A purely numerical and resource-based hypothetical merger scenario was quickly revealed to be merely idealistic. Before the merger, Daimler-Benz appointed Andreas Renschler, a seasoned executive with extensive experience in both the U.S. and Germany, to oversee the merger and assess whether it could truly be win-win. His findings highlighted several issues: 1. The communication styles between Americans and Germans are very different, posing a problem. 2. Americans tend to speak very forcefully and are overly optimistic, expressing themselves directly based on facts, while Germans are generally more cautious and often consider the worst-case scenario. 3. Americans like to ‘paint the big picture’ and work out the details later, whereas Germans prefer to include details from the beginning. This difference makes misunderstandings and conflicts in conversations more likely. 4. Americans enjoy jokes and have a casual style, quickly addressing others by their first names, whereas Germans are more serious and dislike excessive jokes or talk. 5. The relatively relaxed attitude of Americans can cause discomfort among Germans of certain ranks. 6. Americans view charismatic speaking as a sign of confidence, while Germans may perceive speaking loudly or too assertively as rude or overly familiar if it occurs too soon in a relationship. 7. In discussions or meetings, Americans may strongly contradict or express their opinions, whereas Germans are less confrontational, especially towards superiors. While these differences alone are not enough to deem the merger a failure, various other factors were involved. However, the importance of communication and organizational culture cannot be overstated. Those who have experienced difficulties working with colleagues or superiors from the same cultural background due to differences in communication styles understand how crucial organizational communication and culture are. Ultimately, the $36 billion merger between Chrysler and Daimler-Benz ended in a divorce worth just $7 billion after nine years. The divorce between Daimler-Benz and Chrysler, while influenced by national cultural differences, also underscores how crucial it is for corporate cultures to align. While leadership plays a significant role in shaping an organization’s culture, the communication style and mindset of a strong leader often become embedded in the culture. That’s why the importance of leadership is emphasized. An organization led by a leader who encourages open discussion will naturally develop a culture of communication, whereas a culture where everyone is expected to figure things out themselves based on documents or data will likely lead everyone to adopt that communication style. Understanding and aligning corporate culture and direction in mergers and acquisitions increases the chances of success; failing to do so increases the likelihood of failure. -- -- Follow Written by David SEHYEON Baek 372 Followers · 357 Following Entrepreneur at heart / Head of Policy & Analysis Division at APO / Columnist / Book Author/ Email: focus1on1@gmail.com Follow No responses yet Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech
