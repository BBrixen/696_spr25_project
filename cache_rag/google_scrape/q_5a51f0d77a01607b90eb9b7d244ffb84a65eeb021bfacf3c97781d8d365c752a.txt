Heisman Trophy winners of past 25 years power rankings Skip to main content Advertising NFL Photos | NFL Photography Gallery | NFL.com Heisman Trophy winners of past 25 years power rankings This is a ranking of the last 25 Heisman Trophy winners (going back to 1990), not based just on what they accomplished in the NFL, but also taking into account the college football achievements of each award winner. The Cleveland Browns' decision to move on from Johnny Manziel after just two seasons highlights just how the NFL performances of Heisman winners varies tremendously. While Manziel's NFL career is in jeopardy, the two players who followed him as Heisman winners -- Jameis Winston and Marcus Mariota -- seem to have promising NFL careers ahead of them. It also should be noted that in this exercise we are not excluding Reggie Bush, who won the Heisman Trophy in 2005 but voluntarily forfeited his trophy in 2010 . While records can be vacated years after the fact, you can't take away the memories. Copied! 1 / 25 25. Jason White (2003) College: Oklahoma National championships: 0 NFL draft: Undrafted NFL seasons: 0 | Pro Bowls: 0 More Heisman Trophy winners have gone undrafted (15) than have made the Pro Football Hall of Fame (9, with the induction of Tim Brown this year). White is the last Heisman winner to go undrafted. After winning the award in 2003, White was also a finalist in 2004, but finished third behind winner Matt Leinart and Adrian Peterson. White took OU to consecutive BCS title games, but lost both games (including a 55-19 dump trucking against Leinart-led USC). Despite his college success, White was not picked in the 2005 draft, had a tryout with the Kansas City Chiefs and eventually landed a free-agent contract with the Tennessee Titans, but retired from football, citing weak knees. Associated Press 2 / 25 24. Eric Crouch (2001) College: Nebraska National championships: 0 NFL draft: 2002, Round 3, No. 95 overall to St. Louis Rams NFL seasons: 0 | Pro Bowls: 0 Crouch was a wonder to watch running Nebraska's option offense, but was considered too short (6-foot-0) to play quarterback at the next level. However, teams were intrigued by his athleticism (he is just one of three quarterbacks in FBS history to have 3,000-plus yards rushing and 4,000-plus yards passing in a career). The Rams took a chance on Crouch -- the wide receiver -- in the third round of the 2002 draft . Injuries kept Crouch from ever playing a down in the NFL. For a few years, he bounced around leagues (NFL Europe, CFL, UFL) and positions, switching to safety while in NFL Europe. Associated Press 3 / 25 23. Johnny Manziel (2012) College: Texas A&M National championships: 0 NFL draft: 2014, Round 1, No. 22 overall to Cleveland Browns NFL seasons: 2 | Pro Bowls: 0 Manziel won the Heisman as a redshirt freshman, becoming the first freshman ever to win the Heisman Trophy. "Johnny Football" played just two seasons of college ball before moving on to the NFL, where his career has gotten off to a rocky start. His first NFL start, a 30-0 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 14 last season, was dreadful. He followed up his rookie season with a 10-week stay in rehab. Promise of a personal turnaround in Year 2 didn't exactly materialize, and off-field issues finally forced the Browns to move on after just two seasons. Associated Press 4 / 25 22. Troy Smith (2006) College: Ohio State National championships: 0 NFL draft: 2007, Round 5, No. 174 overall to Baltimore Ravens NFL seasons: 4 | Pro Bowls: 0 Smith won the Heisman by a healthy margin over Darren McFadden and Brady Quinn, and then had his college career conclude in a national title game nightmare against Florida. Smith completed just four of 14 passes for 35 yards, had an interception and a fumble, and was sacked five times as OSU fell 41-14 to Florida. Smith's draft stock dropped considerably as a result. Smith played sparingly in three seasons with the Ravens, and made six starts while with the San Francisco 49ers in 2010, his last season in the NFL. Associated Press 5 / 25 21. Charlie Ward (1993) College: Florida State National championships: 1 (1993) NFL draft: Undrafted NFL seasons: N/A | Pro Bowls: N/A In 1993, Florida State finally got over the hump. After a series of heartbreaking defeats against the Hurricanes, FSU finally beat in-state rival Miami, ending a 31-game regular-season win streak for "The U". Ward delivered Florida State's first national title and became the school's first Heisman winner (it's also notable that he beat Pro Football Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk in the Heisman voting). Had Ward been born 20 years later, he might have been considered a stronger NFL prospect. Instead, Ward was a first-round pick of the NBA's New York Knicks. He helped the team reach the 1999 NBA Finals and ultimately played 12 seasons in the league. Associated Press 6 / 25 20. Gino Torretta (1992) College: Miami (Fla.) National championships: 2 (1989, 1991) NFL draft: 1993, Round 7, No. 192 overall to Minnesota Vikings NFL seasons: 2 | Pro Bowls: 0 As Miami's starting quarterback in 1991 and 1992, Torretta led the Hurricanes to 23 consecutive wins before falling to Alabama in the de facto national title game, the 1993 Sugar Bowl. Despite all the collegiate accolades, Torretta was a late-round draft pick and bounced around the NFL, only seeing on-field action with the Vikings and Seattle Seahawks, attempting just 16 pro passes in the process. Associated Press 7 / 25 19. Chris Weinke (2000) College: Florida State National championships: 1 (1999) NFL draft: 2001, Round 4, No. 106 overall to Carolina Panthers NFL seasons: 5 | Pro Bowls: 0 Weinke took Florida State to consecutive national title games, winning one against Michael Vick-led Virginia Tech but losing the next year to Josh Heupel-led Oklahoma. With the Panthers, Weinke was the primary starting quarterback during the team's disastrous 1-15 season in 2001 (that debacle of a season did, however, net the team Julius Peppers in the 2002 NFL Draft). That 2001 season was Weinke's only NFL season as a starter; he made just five more NFL starts over the next six seasons. Associated Press 8 / 25 18. Rashaan Salaam (1994) College: Colorado National championships: 0 NFL draft: 1995, Round 1, No. 21 overall to Chicago Bears NFL seasons: 4 | Pro Bowls: 0 This is the year Steve McNair probably should have won the Heisman Trophy. However, coming out of tiny Alcorn State hindered McNair's chances, despite the backing of a well-known sports publication . Salaam led the nation with 2,055 yards and 24 touchdowns rushing for a Colorado team that finished 11-1. Salaam did rush for 1,074 yards as a rookie with the Bears, but his favorite play was the fumble (he had 9 that season). Turnovers and injuries derailed Salaam's NFL career, and he was last seen playing for the Memphis Maniax of the XFL in 2001 (he was the league's fourth-leading rusher , so there's that). Associated Press 9 / 25 17. Ty Detmer (1990) College: BYU National championships: 0 NFL draft: 1992, Round 9, No. 230 overall to Green Bay Packers NFL seasons: 8 | Pro Bowls: 0 Detmer's Heisman-winning season ranks as one of the greatest ever put together by a quarterback, throwing for 5,188 yards and 41 touchdowns in 12 games. During that epic campaign, Detmer led a 28-21 upset of top-ranked Miami, throwing for 406 yards and three touchdowns in the process. Detmer finished his career at BYU with 15,031 yards and 121 touchdowns passing. However, his 6-foot-1 stature meant a profound fall in the 1992 draft. Detmer's arrival in Green Bay coincided with that of Brett Favre. With Favre embarking on a run that saw him start every game for the Packers for the next 16 years, Detmer was relegated to a backup role before going to the Philadelphia Eagles. He started 11 games in 1996, including a playoff game. Associated Press 10 / 25 16. Danny Wuerffel (1996) College: Florida National championships: 1 (1996) NFL draft: 1997, Round 4, No. 99 overall to New Orleans Saints NFL seasons: 6 | Pro Bowls: 0 Wuerffel enjoyed a decorated career with the Gators, guiding the team to four consecutive SEC titles. Wuerffel capped his college career with a Heisman Trophy and a victory in the 1996 national championship game, an authoritative 52-20 win over in-state rival Florida State in the 1997 Sugar Bowl. Wuerffel bounced around in the NFL, spending four seasons with the New Orleans Saints, one with the Green Bay Packers, one with the Chicago Bears and his final season (2002) with the Washington Redskins (who were coached by Wuerffel's college coach, Steve Spurrier). While playing for the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe in 2000, Wuerffel earned World Bowl MVP honors after defeating the Scottish Claymores in the league's championship game. Associated Press 11 / 25 15. Marcus Mariota (2014) College: Oregon National championships: 0 NFL draft: 2015, Round 1, No. 2 overall to Tennessee Titans NFL seasons: 1 | Pro Bowls: N/A After becoming the first Oregon player -- as well as Hawaii-born athlete -- to win the Heisman Trophy, Mariota directed the Ducks to the first College Football Playoff championship game, where it was defeated by Ohio State. While the Titans have struggled to attain victories in his first NFL season, Mariota is developing into the familiar high-octane offensive threat that characterized his career at Oregon. In Week 9, Mariota became the first rookie QB with two games with at least four touchdown passes. In Week 13, Mariota became the only player in NFL history to pass for at least 250 yards with three touchdowns and rush for more than 100 yards in the same game. Associated Press 12 / 25 14. Jameis Winston (2013) College: Florida State National championships: 1 (2013) NFL draft: 2015, Round 1, No. 1 overall to Tampa Bay Buccaneers NFL seasons: 1 | Pro Bowls: 1 Winston delivered a national title to Florida State and won the Heisman Trophy in the process, and then followed that up by getting the Seminoles into the first-ever College Football Playoff. Winston became the 20th Heisman Trophy winner (and eighth Heisman-winning quarterback) to become a No. 1 overall selection in the NFL draft. After a slow start to his rookie season, Winston improved his play and earned a Pro Bowl nod as an injury replacement. Winston's 4,042 passing yards are the third-most by a rookie in NFL history and his 22 touchdown passes are tied for the fourth-most by a rookie in NFL history. . In Week 11, Winston threw five touchdowns with no interceptions and joined Ray Buivid (Dec. 5, 1937) as the only rookie quarterbacks in NFL history to accomplish the feat. Associated Press 13 / 25 13. Sam Bradford (2008) College: Oklahoma National championships: 0 NFL draft: 2010, Round 1, No. 1 overall to St. Louis Rams NFL seasons: 6 | Pro Bowls: 0 Bradford won the Heisman as a redshirt sophomore, becoming just the second sophomore (after Tim Tebow) to win the award. Then, he had his Heisman season conclude with a loss to Tebow and Florida in the BCS title game. Rather than enter the 2009 draft, Bradford returned for a third season at OU, but in a sign of things to come, he played in just three games during an injury-riddled season. Bradford did start every game in two of his five seasons with the Rams (2010 -- when he earned NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors -- and 2012). An ACL tear in the third preseason game of 2014 effectively ended Bradford's tenure in St. Louis, precipitating an offseason trade to the Philadelphia Eagles. Entering Week 14, Bradford has started 10 games -- his highest total since 2012. Associated Press 14 / 25 12. Mark Ingram (2009) College: Alabama National championships: 1 (2009) NFL draft: 2011, Round 1, No. 28 overall to New Orleans Saints NFL seasons: 5 | Pro Bowls: 1 Ingram has the honor of being the last non-quarterback to win the Heisman Trophy, doing so in the closest vote in the award's history, edging Stanford's Toby Gerhart. He was also the first Heisman winner for Alabama, which went on to win the national title that season. Ingram had a breakthrough season for the Saints in 2014, rushing for a career-high 964 yards and nine touchdowns en route to earning a Pro Bowl nod. Associated Press 15 / 25 11. Matt Leinart (2004) College: USC National championships: 2 (2003, 2004) NFL draft: 2006, Round 1, No. 10 overall to Arizona Cardinals NFL seasons: 6 | Pro Bowls: 0 Leinart earned his Heisman on a ballot that included such notables as Adrian Peterson, Alex Smith, Reggie Bush and Aaron Rodgers. After having led USC to consecutive national titles, Leinart returned for a shot at a third. However, he -- and 2005 Heisman winner Reggie Bush -- were defeated in an epic title game showdown by Texas and the heroics of quarterback Vince Young . When the Cardinals reached Super Bowl XLIII, it was veteran Kurt Warner, not Leinart, who directed the team's offense. Associated Press 16 / 25 10. Ron Dayne (1999) College: Wisconsin National championships: 0 NFL draft: 2000, Round 1, No. 11 overall to New York Giants NFL seasons: 7 | Pro Bowls: 0 Dayne's brilliant career in Madison included two Rose Bowl wins and finishing with 6,397 yards rushing, an FBS record that still stands. In 2000, Dayne was "Thunder" to Tiki Barber's "Lightning" as the New York Giants reached Super Bowl XXXV. Overall, Dayne had a disappointing NFL career, but did have a moment in the spotlight in the Denver Broncos' win over the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day 2005, rushing for 98 yards and a touchdown in a 24-21 win. Associated Press 17 / 25 9. Robert Griffin III (2011) College: Baylor National championships: 0 NFL draft: 2012, Round 1, No. 2 overall to Washington Redskins NFL seasons: 4 | Pro Bowls: 1 RGIII's dual-threat capabilities netted him 47 total TDs during his Heisman-winning season (37 by air, 10 by ground). His electric style of play prompted the Redskins to make a blockbuster trade with the St. Louis Rams to move up in the 2012 NFL Draft and into the No. 2 spot. In his rookie season, RGIII did not disappoint, earning NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors, becoming a Pro Bowl selection and leading the Redskins to the playoffs. However, all that immediate glory came at a huge price. RGIII's style of play made him injury-prone. During the Redskins' playoff loss to the Seattle Seahawks, RGIII suffered a major knee injury. He hasn't been the same since, starting just 20 games in the next two-plus seasons. Associated Press/National Football League 18 / 25 8. Tim Tebow (2007) College: Florida National championships: 2 (2006, 2008) NFL draft: 2010, Round 1, No. 25 overall to Denver Broncos NFL seasons: 4 | Pro Bowls: 0 Tebow is one of the most decorated college football players in the game's history. He was a starter in Florida's 2009 national championship win and a major contributor in the 2007 title-winning season as a freshman.  In 2011, Tebow's penchant for late-game heroics inspired the phrase "Tebow Time." After a 1-4 start, the Broncos inserted Tebow as the starter and the team finished 8-8, winning the AFC West. Tebow then delivered a dramatic wild-card playoff win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. When the Broncos signed Peyton Manning in the 2012 offseason, Tebow was expendable and traded to the New York Jets, for whom he played sparingly. Associated Press 19 / 25 7. Desmond Howard (1991) College: Michigan National championships: 0 NFL draft: 1992, Round 1, No. 4 overall to Washington Redskins NFL seasons: 11 | Pro Bowls: 1 Howard won the Heisman in large part due to his dynamic talents as a receiver and return specialist. He ultimately capped the award-winning season by producing one of the seminal moments in Michigan football history. He scored 23 touchdowns in 1991 for the Wolverines, including 19 receiving. Howard's NFL career wasn't quite as productive. However, he did enjoy one season as an virtually unstoppable force on kickoff and punt returns during the Green Bay Packers' run to victory in Super Bowl XXXI, a game in which Howard earned MVP honors. Associated Press/National Football League 20 / 25 6. Reggie Bush (2005) College: USC National championships: 2 (2003, 2004) NFL draft: 2006, Round 1, No. 2 overall to New Orleans Saints NFL seasons: 10 | Pro Bowls: 0 Despite being the first Heisman Trophy winner to have to forfeit his award, Bush's accomplishments on the field at both USC and in the NFL are worthy of a lofty place on this list. Bush was part one of the greatest runs of success in college football history while at USC, and then went on to win a Super Bowl with the New Orleans Saints. Associated Press 21 / 25 5. Ricky Williams (1998) College: Texas National championships: 0 NFL draft: 1999, Round 1, No. 5 overall to New Orleans Saints NFL seasons: 11 | Pro Bowls: 1 Williams rushed for 2,327 yards and 29 touchdowns during his Heisman Trophy-winning season. The next spring, the Saints traded all of their remaining 1999 draft selections in order to move into position to pick Williams. His career in New Orleans wasn't what was expected (though, he did have two 1,000-yard rushing seasons) and he was traded to the Miami Dolphins, for whom he led the NFL in rushing yards (1,853) in 2002. In all, Williams spent 11 seasons in the NFL, rushing for 10,009 yards and 66 touchdowns. Associated Press 22 / 25 4. Carson Palmer (2002) College: USC National championships: 0 NFL draft: 2003, Round 1, No. 1 overall to Cincinnati Bengals NFL seasons: 12 | Pro Bowls: 3 Palmer parlayed his successful college career -- during which he helped turn USC into a national powerhouse -- into a productive career in the NFL. Palmer was provided with a great (and nowadays very rare) luxury as an NFL rookie, he took a "redshirt" season and was allowed to develop for a year while Jon Kitna took every snap for the Bengals in 2003. In 2005, Palmer delivered the team's first playoff appearance in 15 years. Much like he did at USC, Palmer helped turn the fortunes of the Bengals around. He's done much the same in Arizona, where the Cardinals have made consecutive playoff appearances. Among Heisman-winning QBs, Palmer has the second-most career passing yards (40,036); behind Vinny Testaverde (46,233) but ahead of Hall of Famer Roger Staubach (22,700). Associated Press 23 / 25 3. Cam Newton (2010) College: Auburn National championships: 1 (2010) NFL draft: 2011, Round 1, No. 1 overall to Carolina Panthers NFL seasons: 5 | Pro Bowls: 3 Newton initially went to Florida, but got suspended from the team. He then transferred to Binn College in Texas, where he led the team to the 2009 NJCAA National Football Championship. A year later, he was guiding Auburn to the national championship after winning the Heisman Trophy. As a rookie, Newton earned NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. Newton also has guided the Panthers to consecutive playoff appearances in 2013 and 2014, helping the team become the first from the NFC South to win back-to-back division crowns. In 2015, Newton led the Panthers to a third consecutive NFC South title, a 15-1 finish and the second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. Associated Press 24 / 25 2. Eddie George (1995) College: Ohio State National championships: 0 NFL draft: 1996, Round 1, No. 14 overall to Houston Oilers NFL seasons: 9 | Pro Bowls: 4 George's school-record 1,927 yards and 24 TDs rushing earned him the Heisman, just barely beating Nebraska QB Tommie Frazier (this is noteworthy, because Frazier was awesome ). In the NFL, George was a workhorse. In eight of his nine seasons, George toted the ball 300 or more times. He posted seven 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He is probably best known for his efforts in helping lead the Tennessee Titans to Super Bowl XXXIV. George is only the second NFL running back to get to 10,000 yards rushing while never missing a start . The other? Jim Brown. Associated Press 25 / 25 1. Charles Woodson (1997) College: Michigan National championships: 1 (1997) NFL draft: 1998, Round 1, No. 4 overall to Oakland Raiders NFL seasons: 18 | Pro Bowls: 9 When Tim Brown was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame over the summer, he became the ninth Heisman winner to be enshrined in Canton. Five years after he retires, Woodson will make it an even 10. Woodson was the first -- and still only -- primarily defensive player to win the Heisman. With 65 career NFL interceptions, Woodson is tied for fifth on the NFL's all-time list. He's returned 11 of those interceptions for TDs, just one short of Rod Woodson's NFL record. During his career rebirth in Green Bay, Woodson earned NFL Defensive POY honors in 2009, one of two seasons in which he led the NFL in interceptions as a Packer. In 2010, Woodson was a member of the Packers' Super Bowl XLV-winning team.
