Manage Topics News Nintendo Switch Hardware Splatoon 2 Bundles Colourful Nintendo Switch Splatoon 2 Edition Bundle is Heading to North America Soon It's pretty fresh by Thomas Whitehead Thu 17th Aug 2017 Share: 19 Splatoon 2 has already emerged as an important year one hit for the Nintendo Switch, and the big N has been looking to utilise the IP to promote the hardware. Now Nintendo of America is joining in with a neat hardware bundle to build demand further. The Nintendo Switch Splatoon 2 Edition bundle will be a Walmart exclusive in North America and is set to arrive on 8th September; it'll be the first chance to get the Splatoon-coloured Joy-Con in the territory. It'll cost $379.99USD (up from the standard $299.99), and will include the console, a Splatoon 2 download code, a Splatoon-themed carry case and those colourful Joy-Con. Are any of you planning to target this bundle when it's released?

Author Profile Reply Comments 83 1 tamantayoshi Thu 17th Aug 2017 So you save no money buying this bundle? 8 2 Pokefanmum82 Thu 17th Aug 2017 Probably not since it's going to be crazy expensive here. 0 3 olrodlegacy Thu 17th Aug 2017 Makes no sense that the UK got this with the red and blue joy-con.. I have all three UK editions nonetheless, though. Collecting goals... 0 4 Azooooz Thu 17th Aug 2017 Strange. Usually, when you buy a bundle, you save some money. But this bundle doesn't save money at all: 1- Switch console ($300) 2- Splatoon 2: ($60) 3- Carrying Case: ($10-15) Edit: Never mind, it save a little amount of money. 5 5 Illusion Thu 17th Aug 2017 If only people who waited for Splatoon 2 to buy a Switch had known about this bundle.  Timing is everything. 1 6 ECMIM Thu 17th Aug 2017 This is a little late, no? 6 7 WhiteTrashGuy Thu 17th Aug 2017 Just release those joy-con here Nintendo!!! 6 8 SLIGEACH_EIRE Thu 17th Aug 2017 EUROPE? Walmart exclusive? That's really crappy. 0 9 thesilverbrick Thu 17th Aug 2017 The MSRP is a joke. You don't save any money on the bundle, which is what I thought the point of a bundle was in the first place. The game and console separately cost $20 less than this, and getting a carrying case for $20 isn't exactly consolation, seeing as such a case isn't expensive to produce at all. The game isn't even a physical copy, for crying out loud, saving Nintendo the material costs outright. This should be $350 at most to make any fiscal sense for the consumer. 18 10 mowerdude Thu 17th Aug 2017 I still need to pick up a Nintendo Switch, but I thought the point of having bundles were to save some money but this one doesn't. So I will just wait closer to the holiday times and see what kind of bundle comes out around Black Friday time and see if I can't save some money then. 1 11 gatorboi352 Thu 17th Aug 2017 lol wtf is this?  this isn't even a bundle.  bundles save people on the retail cost of the individual items. 7 12 Anti-Matter Thu 17th Aug 2017 The Switch tablet is still BLACK !! I want WHITE / BLUE / SILVER , Nintendo. 1 13 sketchturner Thu 17th Aug 2017 In this day and age bundles are less about saving money. It's about a unique system with special controllers and a special box. Slap some unique artwork on there and Nintendo could charge a premium for it... Collectors will eat it up. 9 14 FX102A Thu 17th Aug 2017 Can understand the views that a bundle should be cheaper overall, but with sales going so well any company would try to ensure maximum returns. This just makes it easier to get all the items together and means if you don't own a Switch, you can get the Splatoon 2 Joycons with the console rather than paying extra. The download code for the game is a disappointment for those who like physical media but this is becoming an industry norm. 4 15 Anti-Matter Thu 17th Aug 2017 @thesilverbrick I think it is funny and weird. New 2DS XL can comes in White + Orange and Black + Turquoise, and both of them has been arrived on my country Indonesia in Asian region (The box has Green and Blue Circle symbol, still counted as NTSC-U) but Switch body tablet still Black ? No White Option ? I know if Switch mainly focused on young adult gamers but it doesn't means every young adult audiences agree with Black color for electronic devices as a Common color. They think Black is Common or Cool looking color, I adore White color as the Opposition 100% (I saw Black color for electronic devices as a Boring, Unattractive, Cheap color while White I saw as an Expensive, Rare, Luxury, Innocent, Jack of All Trades color) Eh... sorry for my complains. 0 16 Bunkerneath Thu 17th Aug 2017 It doesn't even come with the proper game, its a download code? Man anyone who buys this is a massive chump 4 17 thesilverbrick Thu 17th Aug 2017 @Anti-Matter I kind of understand where you're coming from. I love myself a green console, but Nintendo almost never makes them. I did get the lime green New 3DS XL last year and I love it, but I don't think I will be able to get a green console again for a long time. I do honestly think that in the future there will be other color options for the Switch, but this is way too early. Since they have had trouble keeping up with the demand for the Switch, it's going to take a while until they can satisfy that demand enough to start producing two different colors. As far as your example of the New 2DS XL, please note that in North America Nintendo only released it in one color. The reason for that is probably because North America is Nintendo's largest market and trying to produce a large amount of consoles in more than one color would have been difficult, especially given the stock shortages they had with the Switch and the need to satisfy demand for the upcoming SNES Classic Edition. Nintendo typically waits before launching alternate colors of a console. This is usually when demand starts to die down. New colors tend to attract new people and reignite interest. I expect a Switch of a different body color will eventually arrive, but not for at least another year or so. 2 18 ChuJelly Thu 17th Aug 2017 Oh hey, it's the pink and green joycon! Those have yet to be released over here. Nintendo better release them separately stateside and not make them exclusive to the (admittedly rather meh for how late it is) bundle. I've been holding back on buying other joycons just for the hope of getting them. 1 19 Spoony_Tech Thu 17th Aug 2017 For that price it should have a hard copy of the game..... 1 20 Sinton Thu 17th Aug 2017 Love those Joy-Con colors. 1 21 aaronsullivan Thu 17th Aug 2017 Hmm... this is actually very appealing as a second Switch console for a family that wants to play Splatoon 2 together. I mean, we already have a hard copy of Splatoon 2 so a digital copy feels convenient. We definitely want different color JoyCon than the other types (both of which we already have) and really, a case is very useful, and we love Splatoon. Timing is bad for us, but the temptation will be there. 2 22 Zander1992 Thu 17th Aug 2017 I literally got my new one 2 days ago lol thanks alot Wal-Mart !!! 0 23 LexKitteh Thu 17th Aug 2017 I only want the controller! Let me buy the controller XD 1 24 TheBigK Thu 17th Aug 2017 If it hits Canada, be prepared to pay around $499.99. $399.99 for the system, $79.99 for the game, and $20 for the case. 1 25 Yasaal Thu 17th Aug 2017 Wow. Finally? That's great news! Let's just hope they have enough units to supply then. 1 26 Xyphon22 Thu 17th Aug 2017 I was so excited when I saw the headline because I have been waiting for a bundle to get a Switch, and I was sad when Europe got one and we didn't when Splatoon 2 launched.  Then I read the article.  I guess I am going to wait some more.  Hopefully Mario Odyseey will have one that is actually a deal. 0 27 Fred13 Thu 17th Aug 2017 I was hoping this would come here. I would have bought it for my Wife's birthday, but her birthday was almost a month ago. Since it didn't come in time I just bought a regular Switch and a copy of the game. She would have loved those Joy cons and that case, but it is what it is. I wish they'd sell the case separate, but I doubt they will. 0 28 abbyhitter Thu 17th Aug 2017 So glad I don't have a Switch yet. I'm getting this bundle ASAP! 2 29 Fred13 Thu 17th Aug 2017 @gatorboi352 @thesilverbrick @Azooooz @tamantayoshi Why would they make it cheaper when it's been impossible to keep up with demand. The purpose of this bundle is to get the special colored Joy Cons and the special case for those that are into that sort of thing. If my wife and I didn't BOTH already have our own Switch I'd grab this bundle! 1 30 Xyphon22 Thu 17th Aug 2017 @Azooooz Your prices add up to $370-375.  The bundle costs $380.  This bundle costs $5-10 more than buying each item individually, and you don't get the physical game.  This is the worst bundle ever, and that's saying something given all of the ones Gamestop offers. 1 31 thesilverbrick Thu 17th Aug 2017 @Fred13 Why would they make it cheaper? Because of something called business ethics. It only makes sense to reward customers buying more with a lower price. That's the point of a bundle to begin with. What they're doing here is tantamount to scalping, which shouldn't be done by the manufacturer of a product. Leave that to the lowlifes on eBay. Sure, they have the right to do it and will likely get away with it, but it doesn't erase the fact that it's a low move and runs counter to every bundle they've ever released in their 30+ years of selling video games. 2 32 Octane Thu 17th Aug 2017 $380!? lol 1 33 Fred13 Thu 17th Aug 2017 @thesilverbrick Scalping would be if the bundle was priced at $450. It would be them charging MORE for the bundle, but in this case they're leaving the price alone and giving you a cool new option that YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE. If you don't like this bundle you can buy the system and then select the game you want. Besides that THERE IS NOTHING in Business Ethics against what they're doing with this bundle. You guys whine and cry about everything. Yes it would be cool it if was cheaper, but you don't drop the price on your product before you can even meet demand that would be economic stupidity. 3 34 YANDMAN Thu 17th Aug 2017 Why dont they actualy do something wityh the system dock, its totally lame. You can just buy these joycons now from new with the system, making this absolutely not a special edition. 0 35 thesilverbrick Thu 17th Aug 2017 @Fred13 You don't have to bark at me in caps. We can have a civil discussion without resorting to that. I will reiterate: they have a right to charge whatever they want for their products, and I have a right to purchase them or not. That much we can agree on. I think the reason why you are seeing people up in arms about this is because it is not typical for Nintendo to ever do something like this. They have never in their 30+ years of selling video games sold a bundle for the exact sum if its individual parts. They have always created a monetary incentive to buy something like this (i.e. a marginally smaller price point). This is a symptom of a much larger trend among Nintendo that I don't particularly care for. The Wii sold better than the Switch is selling but Nintendo never made artificially padded Wii bundles and sold them for more than the collective MSRP of their items. I, like you, I am entitled to my opinion and as long as I can deliver it in a civil, logical way, I should be able to post it in the comments section of an article on the topic without someone snapping at me in all caps. I hate to say it, but you are likely in the minority of people that think this is completely par for the course for Nintendo. This is not something they have ever done, and it represents a shift in the company that many people are disappointed in and I think they are completely valid in expressing that disappointment. 1 36 AirElephant Thu 17th Aug 2017 I don't know why everyone is getting so upset.  It's not like you'll ACTUALLY be able to walk in to Walmart and buy one. 4 37 redd214 Thu 17th Aug 2017 My goodness so much whining, it's ridiculous! "Scalping" really? You guys need to relax, it's not that serious. Anyways, wish we could just have the customization options like in Japan. Would make things so much easier 2 38 abbyhitter Thu 17th Aug 2017 Can someone give us a heads up when pre-orders open? I want to snag one before they're all gone. 0 39 JaxonH Thu 17th Aug 2017 @Bunkerneath It doesn't even come with the proper game, its a download code? Man anyone who buys this is a massive chump Ah, I see. So people who like digital and want those splatcons... They're real chumps huh... Cause buying what you want is the telltale sign of a "chump" apparently Love how people on this site are all about knocking, insulting and belittling those who don't do and behave exactly as they do 3 40 justin233 Thu 17th Aug 2017 I want those joy cons. Are they available outside this bundle in the US? 0 41 PanurgeJr Thu 17th Aug 2017 @thesilverbrick Then people are expressing disappointment in fundamental business, and are ignorant of basic economics.  You are correct that cheaper bundles are designed to create a financial incentive for people who wouldn't purchase otherwise, but you fail to follow that concept to its logical conclusion.  When there are enough people who are willing to purchase at the standard price, there is no need to create any further incentive.  The opposite is true, in fact--maximizing revenue requires not offering discounts at all, because all they'd be doing is lowering their profits with no additional sales gained.  Once manufacturing catches up to demand and demand itself levels off, you will see bundle discounts.  But not yet. 5 42 WindWakerLink Thu 17th Aug 2017 @Azooooz No. No. you're right. We are not saving with this bundle. If we buy these things separately it will be under $400 with taxes. If we buy this bundle it's over $400 with taxes. That's a little silly. Is it because the joycons are green and pink that we are not really saving with this bundle? Buy beware perhaps? Hmmm.... 0 43 Agramonte Thu 17th Aug 2017 379? Err, better off just getting it regular. You even get the physical copy of the game. You can also find S2 "like new" on Amazon for 45-47 dollars. 0 44 Jimsbo Thu 17th Aug 2017 Ah, there's not much point in comparing the asking price of this bundle compared to the individual items. It's not like anyone's going to find one at those prices. You'll have to wait and see what the resellers are going to try to charge. 0 45 needmorecowbell Thu 17th Aug 2017 The "mistake" is an economic analysis of bundles that actually includes the company embracing a humanistic bent and celebrating the consumer for their brand loyalty. However I'm surprised no one is backing Fred up here. It is painfully obvious that Nintendo has gotten more money hungry (I know, it's a business, that's the frickin' point). I guess I should be praising Nintendo for their business savy? Or perhaps marveling at the extent of our brand loyalty : ). Hey, all I know is this, playing Breath of the Wild in March after attending the midnight launch (my first) at Best Buy was ******* transcendent. 1 46 thesilverbrick Thu 17th Aug 2017 @PanurgeJr I certainly understand why economically they could make the decision they did, but it slaps in the face of everything they have done in the past. Like I said, the Wii sold better than the Switch is currently doing, and Nintendo never released a bundle that cost the sum of its collective parts. They have never done this in their history of selling video games, no matter how successful or in demand  their product was. I would never deign to contest that Nintendo doesn't have a right to charge whatever they want for their products, but I sure can justifiably feel disappointed to see them shifting in a direction that is less beneficial for the consumer and runs contrary and counter to everything they have done in the past. 1 47 Refurin Thu 17th Aug 2017 Oh Nintendo PLEASE don't give Walmart exclusives.  I refuse to spend money with that morally bankrupt corporation. 1 48 needmorecowbell Thu 17th Aug 2017 Oops I meant backing good ol silverback, my b 1 49 needmorecowbell Thu 17th Aug 2017 Silverbrick I meant...**evaporates into floor** 1 50 Supadav03 Thu 17th Aug 2017 The fact that it's exclusive to Walmart makes it an automatic pass. 1 51 Fred13 Thu 17th Aug 2017 @thesilverbrick First of all, small misunderstanding. When I capitolize 2-4 words it's just to emphasize them not to yell. It's something that happens because of the way we do things where I work so while I recognize that the internet as a whole understands that as yelling that's not what i meant. Beyond that, you're right in that you can have the opinion that they should charge less and you can choose not to buy it, but you specifically said it was against business ethic which is straight up false. 1 52 Jeronan Thu 17th Aug 2017 @olrodlegacy Yeah absolutely ridiculous that the European Splatoon2 bundle comes with the standard Neo joy-cons and not the Splatoon ones! Isn't that the whole point of the bundle?! /facepalm 0 53 westman98 Thu 17th Aug 2017 By the looks of it, unless you really want the Splatoon-colored JoyCons, Nintendo won't be making any worthwhile bundles until Christmas. 0 54 JaxonH Thu 17th Aug 2017 Btw, I imported these Splatcons and they are so beautiful. Perfect for getting in the Splatoon spirit. Surprised they're actually bringing them to NA finally, even if it's in a bundle. 0 55 PanurgeJr Thu 17th Aug 2017 @JaxonH I'd be jealous of the splatcons, except that I prefer the Pro Controller and have the Splatoon edition, so I'm already representing. 0 56 thesilverbrick Thu 17th Aug 2017 @Fred13 I apologize for misunderstanding your use of caps. I appreciate you clearing that up, and I apologize if I imputed more aggression to your comment than was intended That said, I don't want you to misunderstand where I am coming from, either. In the end, it's not about me being angry with Nintendo for what they're doing or even demanding anything, but just being plain disappointed. This is not the same Nintendo I grew up with. I get how economics works, and clearly you do, too. I fully acknowledge that they will sell all of these bundles in such a short time that the average consumer will never even realize they were ever in stores to begin with. But they could have released a Wii bundle back 2006 with a similar pricing structure, and that would have sold out, as well. But they never did such a thing. In fact, they included a free game with every console they sold. Could they have made more money selling Wii Sports separately? Absolutely. But they didn't, instead opting to give the consumer a little bit more value with their product, which I have always appreciated. It seems those days are gone, and I fully understand that there is nothing I can do about it. But it just feels odd that I am made to feel ridiculous for even being disappointed. 0 57 JaxonH Thu 17th Aug 2017 @PanurgeJr Represent! lol I had the Pro Controller preordered but... I rarely use the Pro because I like split joycon (I will use it for MHXX on the TV though). I may still buy it though. It's slick. But man, those joycon are lit. Have grey, red, yellow, blue and green/pink. Love using them as a fashion statement 0 58 Tingle_The_Great Thu 17th Aug 2017 Sounds good to me 0 59 JJ286 Thu 17th Aug 2017 @ECMIM yes it is!! Makes me super mad. I was waiting for this to gift it to my GF but I caved and I bought her a regular one with the ARMS joy-cons so she could mix it up plus a Splatoon case. 1 60 SnowFox Thu 17th Aug 2017 Still hoping they release a right green Joycon so i can have a blue and green Switch. 0 61 Wolfgabe Thu 17th Aug 2017 so much whine here 2 62 UboaNoticedYou Thu 17th Aug 2017 Honestly a decent enough bundle, as Nintendo's carrying cases are top notch and I wouldn't recommend carrying the system around without one. However, you really aren't saving anything with this bundle. This should have been $350, especially considering the game is only a digital copy. 0 63 Deege Thu 17th Aug 2017 Download code? As much as I like the Pink and Green Joycons, I just can't bring myself to go all digital. 0 64 Fooligan Thu 17th Aug 2017 I don't know. If I can find this I'll probably buy it but who knows. I already passed on a Switch a couple of weeks ago when I saw one at Wal-Mart. ðŸ¤” 0 65 Altaria_97 Thu 17th Aug 2017 Yep, I agree with everyone; this bundle is pretty pointless. The system is already in such high demand that creating a bundle doesn't help, let alone you don't save any money whatsoever (possibly losing some if you plan on using a different travel case). It's not BAD that this bundle exists, it just doesn't make any sense given the demand for the system and lack of savings. 1 66 dkxcalibur Thu 17th Aug 2017 No!!!!!!!  We just got our Switch when Splatoon 2 came out! Oh well, I think I like the neon joy-cons better anyways.  Maybe they'll make more of the special edition color joy-cons. 0 67 Ogre Thu 17th Aug 2017 Waiting until like a month after a game launches to even announce the special edition console to go with it. Oh boy, I can't even pretend to be surprised anymore. But that leaves a major unknown to us consumers. 1. Nintendo of America is so inept and backwards that it can't release its own products in line with the rest of the company worldwide?? Or 2. they intentionally held back, hoping to entice Splatoon fans who already invested to double dip on the Switch?? Poor timing either way...Nintendo just release the green/pink joycon ala cart and call it a day. 2 68 KinneKted Thu 17th Aug 2017 Even though you're not saving any money I will still be lining up out front on release day. Splatoon 2 is a must buy and it's worth it to me for the controllers while carrying case is a little cool. Disappointed it only comes with a dl code because I prefer physical media. Haven't been able to get a switch yet so I'll be holding out until this releases. 0 69 iammikegaines Thu 17th Aug 2017 Already sold out. *hopefully you sense my sarcasm 1 70 KinneKted Thu 17th Aug 2017 @DarkmarkUnited its actually retailing at 500 in Canada I'm still going to pick it up though. Also apparently its releasing on the 14th instead of 8th for some reason. 0 71 JaxonH Thu 17th Aug 2017 @Fooligan It's up for order right now https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-Hardware-with-Splatoon-2-Neon-Green-Neon-Pink-Joy-Cons-Nintendo-Switch/394092847 0 72 HAL9000 Fri 18th Aug 2017 Oh NOOOOO!!!  A Walmart exclusive!  Good luck with their horrible history of pre-order mess ups!  I lost out on Neon Squid amiibo thanks to their screw up... and don't even mention SNES mini. 0 73 Ichiban Fri 18th Aug 2017 Waiting on a $400 1-2 Switch bundle myself 1 74 DTfearTheBEARD Fri 18th Aug 2017 Looks ok but no physical copy of the game with it kinda sucks. I finally got my switch bundle in the mail today, it came with mario kart 8 deluxe and splatoon 2 both (physical) and so far i am very happy with my purchase:) I paid around $460 after tax and 1 day shipping, i have been trying to get a switch since launch and didn't wanna wait any longer haha. I still need to try splatoon 2 tho and see if i like it...... 0 75 Fooligan Fri 18th Aug 2017 @JaxonH Thanks Jaxon. You're a good guy. 0 76 electrolite77 Fri 18th Aug 2017 That's a joke of a price 1 77 cosmicc Fri 18th Aug 2017 Pre-orders have been open since yesterday @abbyhitter 0 78 abbyhitter Fri 18th Aug 2017 @bits Yeah. I got it pre-ordered. Someone on GameFAQs told me. I'm really excited about it. 1 79 cosmicc Fri 18th Aug 2017 @abbyhitter Awesome! I just checked and it looks like Walmart took down the page already. 1 80 abbyhitter Fri 18th Aug 2017 @bits https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-Hardware-with-Splatoon-2-Neon-Green-Neon-Pink-Joy-Cons-Nintendo-Switch/394092847 It says the bundle is out of stock on my end. But I was lucky enough to place the order yesterday a few hours after the order page went live. 1 81 cosmicc Fri 18th Aug 2017 @abbyhitter Oh the page is back now. Glad you were able to get one as well! I was waiting for a color variation to come out that I knew my Daughter would like. This is definitely the one! 1 82 Henmii Sat 19th Aug 2017 Sooooo, a bundle that doesn't save you any money? And a download code instead of the retail-version, of course. Man, even the Switch bundles are terrible. If they are also doing such a "deal" on the new Mario, then you definitely don't have to wait for that! 0 83 Ryu_Niiyama Sun 20th Aug 2017 I just want two green joycon. 0 Show Comments Leave A Comment Hold on there, you need to login to post a comment...
