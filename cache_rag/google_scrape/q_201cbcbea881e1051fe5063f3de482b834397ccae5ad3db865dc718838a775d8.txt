Did it pull it off? Read on, and we’ll go over everything that lead up to that (exclamation) point, then you can weigh in in the comments. Grey’s Anatomy Season 17 Photos View Gallery 141 Images ‘THAT’S THE FOURTH PATIENT I’VE LOST TODAY, AND THEY’RE ALL DYING ALONE… WELCOME BACK, RICHARD!’ | As “All Tomorrow’s Parties” began, it was April 2020 — in other words, mid-pandemic. To Bailey’s surprise, Richard, now happily cobalt-free, reported back to work. He especially wanted to say hello to DeLuca. (In a flashback, we learned that he had struggled mightily after Richard’s surgery — and Carina blamed Meredith for having pushed him.) Webber also wanted to know whether it was true that a whole OR had heard Teddy having sex with Koracick in a voicemail. Nearby, Jackson accidentally overheard Winston tell Maggie that he loved her at the end of a FaceTime call. WTH was that? said her expression. Later, Winston would explain it away in a manner that didn’t freak her out but did kinda make her heart flutter. Oh, and as for Jackson, in a flashback, we saw that Vic had misunderstood a text from her hot doctor lover and showed up at his place with nothing on under her puffy coat… only to be greeted by Harriet in his arms. “I’m not a stepmom,” the incident made her realize. Mm-hmm, except maybe one day to Pru.

When Tom ran into Richard, he explained in his inimitable style that he was carrying around a golf club to keep anyone from getting within six feet. He’d soon snap and use his nine iron on boxes of what were supposed to be PPEs but were actually only booties. Treating Kaden, the burn victim from Station 19 ’s Season 4 premiere ( recapped here ), Jackson had a capital-M moment upon seeing Jo. Apparently, they had hooked up!!! (OK, that qualified for at least one OMG!) Alone with her shortly thereafter, she suggested that “people do stupid things.” Had the hookup been a letdown? In a subsequent flashback, Jo asked Jackson for a “sexual favor” — a bridge over the river of the husband who left her. A one-night bridge to not being a sad sack. And he was “a human male that I kinda trust,” she added, the flatterer. When she showed up for their rendezvous, she hadn’t even bothered to wear pants. He, meanwhile, had set up his place for a date. A bad, bad date. “No girl wants to take her clothes off after eating cheese and cured meat,” she laughed. And certainly not to Kenny G music. Still, they kissed. “I really want to have sex with you,” she said. But she kept crying. Hilarious. ‘WHAT SEEMS LIKE A WEAKNESS IS ACTUALLY A STRENGTH… IF YOU GET HELP’ | In another pre-COVID flashback, we saw that, since DeLuca was resting in an on-call room — Mer hadn’t wanted to leave him home alone in his state — Bailey was able to inform him that Cindy was there asking for him. He had been right, Miranda told him; the girl had been being trafficked. When she’d continued getting sicker, Opal had said that she was useless and dumped her. At that point, she’d made her way back to Grey Sloan. While being treated by DeLuca, she confessed that her real name was Erin. She’d been abducted at 14 after falling for a “photographer’s” scam. Later, Bailey, Mer, Carina and Richard united to stage a kind of intervention for Andrew. “I would give up every life I ever saved to not feel like this,” he cried. He’d even give up having known Mer. He’d only had one goal in life: to not be like his father, and he’d failed. “All we’re asking you to do,” Grey told him, “is fight as hard for yourself as you do for everyone else.” Back in the “present,” as we neared the end of the first episode, Mer, strong as she is, lost it after yet another patient neared death. No sooner had she trashed a supply closet than who should walk in but DeLuca. “Hey,” he said. She was in no mood for “Hey,” though. She was pissed that he’d turned off his cell phone and panicked her. “I’m glad you’re OK,” she said angrily. In one last Cindy flashback — sorry, Erin — she was reunited with her sister, who assured her, “It’s not your fault.” In the “present,” Richard broke the rules to allow Kaden’s mother to see him. “If Bailey asks, I’ll tell her I didn’t get to that part of the manual,” he told Jackson. Oh, that’d go well! When he tried to do exactly that, she started to fuss, but he diverted her by revealing that he’d found a way to sanitize PPEs without deteriorating the masks. She only got on him so much, she said, because she cared. She didn’t want him to put himself at risk. In response, he explained that every one of his relationships had failed. He couldn’t walk away from the one that he has with the hospital, too. Finally, Jo apologized to Jackson for the way she’d behaved toward him. “I’m pretty sure I snotted in your mouth,” she recalled. He wasn’t upset, though; they were friends, they were cool. Bumping into Nico, Levi said that he hoped his ex was doing fine, because he himself wasn’t. He’d just lost his 100th patient. Nico was about as caring and responsive as ever. Ugh. ‘HOW IS NEXT WEEK ALREADY OVER?’ | In “The Center Won’t Hold,” the second of our two episodes, Richard and Catherine crossed paths for apparently the first time since his surgery. When she snarked that he’d better be careful post-op, he wouldn’t want to get hurt again, he shot back, “The only pain I’m feeling right now is square in my ass.” At Mer’s, Amelia was stunned to learn that she’d misplaced a week and missed Link’s birthday. In a flashback, the new parents struggled to name their son. Scout was out, per Amelia. Tony was out, per Link. Maybe they could name him after something they dreamed of? “Snake in a vest” didn’t have a great ring, though, Link noted. In the “present,” Amelia tried to make it up to Link for missing his birthday by occupying the kids with a movie and modeling her birthday suit. Upstairs, the couple partook in a brilliantly naughty, socially-distanced love scene. In the “present,” Owen asked Teddy to talk after work. It seemed they hadn’t really since… since presumably their wedding was postponed. In a flashback, he told Teddy that he should’ve left his mom a voicemail (ha) to let her know they weren’t tying the knot that day. But no, he didn’t wanna cancel. Did she? Oh, Owen. What are you up to? Back in the now, he told his would-be wife that if he died, she’d get Alison, of course. But maybe if she couldn’t handle Leo, too, Amelia and Link could take him. “I’m not OK with you dying,” she said. And that wasn’t what they were supposed to be talking about, anyway — clearly. Before the conversation went any further, she was paged, leaving Owen alone and forlorn. “Let’s talk later then,” he said. When “later” arrived, Teddy challenged Owen to tell her what was wrong. In response, he beseeched her to come clean with him. He loved her. She was his best friend. So spit it out. “No,” she insisted. “There’s nothing.” So he played her the telltale voicemail message that he’d heard on what was supposed to have been their wedding day. “So much for love,” he said. “So much for friendship. So much for trust. So much for us.” ‘SO THAT’S YOUR REPORT? THAT THE WORLD IS ON FIRE?’ | In a meeting with Maggie, Catherine balked at Pierce’s requests. Loudly. But really, they were both just furious that they were faced with a problem that they couldn’t solve. “I hate that everyone is dying!” Catherine yelled. Eventually, they wore themselves out, and Catherine admitted that she hated that Richard hadn’t come back to her. In a flashback, Jackson found his stepfather watching his medical-conference “speech” online. But he couldn’t blame all of his mistakes on cobalt. He’d advised Maggie to operate on her cousin. He’d spent time with Gemma. “I have no one to blame but myself,” said Richard. Later, Jackson acknowledged that his mother could be impossible. But “when she loves, it’s hard.” So Richard needed to choke down his ego and forgive Catherine already. Take her call and hear her out — for Jackson if not himself. In the “present,” Maggie challenged Catherine to woman up and keep fighting for Richard. As the episode drew to a close, Catherine told Tom that she was accepting a resignation that he hadn’t offered as chief of chiefs but would keep him on as neuro chief. She then offered Richard the COC position — and an apology for everything she’d done that had hurt him. Aw, those crazy kids were back together again. Meredith was downright gleeful when she was called in by Cormac to help him save a kid named Frankie’s kidney. (He fell on a spike on Station 19 , you may recall.) The teen’s pal Kaden, meanwhile, turned out to have been burned so badly that even his insides were fried. After Cormac told Frankie’s dad that he’d pulled through surgery, Maggie and DeLuca broke it to Kaden’s father that he… had not. Suddenly, both dads had to feel pretty stupid about the fight they’d had that had injured Bailey’s leg. Reeling from the heartache, Teddy wound up clashing with Jo, who was eager to judge her. “You had a beautiful life,” said Jo, “and you blew it up with a butt-dial.” When Teddy welcomed Jo to judge her as harshly as she wanted — it still wouldn’t be as harshly as she was judging herself — the former Mrs. Karev asked if she’d told Owen that. She’d tried. Well, concluded Jo, “try harder.” Mer got a text from Cormac inviting her for a drink in his office just as it appeared that she and DeLuca had gone back to being just friends. And Nico locked Levi in a storage closet to offer him some “stress relief.” Oh, Schmitt, you deserve better! In the final moments of the episode, Maggie got home to find a tent in the backyard — a gift from Winston so she could get her sleep and see her family whenever she wanted. “I know you don’t like camping,” he joked. But she loved it — and him. Link told Amelia that he’d savored his birthday. “I got sex and a donut” — gluten-free but still. Oh, and they’d decided to name the baby Scout after all — Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln. Leaving Grey Sloan, Teddy approached Owen to apologize and profess her love. What had he done to make her hate him so much that she’d cheat on him? he wanted to know. She hadn’t even said that she wouldn’t run away with Tom, she’d just said that she was marrying Owen, as if it was some fate that she’d accepted. Sorry, nope. He couldn’t forgive her. (For once, I was totally Team Owen.) When Cormac left Grey Sloan for the evening, he found Meredith collapsed in the parking lot. At the same time, apparently hovering between life and death on a beach in her mind, Meredith was reunited with Derek. The Derek. For real. The show had snuck in a guest appearance by Patrick Dempsey! So, what did you think of the Season 17 premiere? Grade it in the poll below, then hit the comments.

So we will see three more scenes of Patrick Dempsey in Grey’s Anatomy this Thursday in epsiode 3.  Then he will be gone.

Reply Sha sha says: November 14, 2020 at 3:13 PM I jumped  up when I seen Derek on the beach. I just love him and mer together  🖤 The two hour premier was definitely an OMG #KEEPTHESEASONSCOMING🖤 Reply Anthony Dedrick says: November 12, 2020 at 8:06 PM I let out a “Holy S-word”. After all that went down beforehand, I was not expecting that so soon. Maybe series finale. But that was a shocking, but pleasant surprise Reply Anthony Dedrick says: November 12, 2020 at 8:08 PM And while Derek wasn’t perfect, I do miss him. My wife and I have been rewatching the series and I’m reminded almost everyday on why Reply Erin says: November 12, 2020 at 8:07 PM I haven’t been that surprised in a long time.  Very good episodes overall! Reply Jessie says: November 12, 2020 at 8:08 PM My jaw hit the floor with that ending. OMG! I can’t wait for next week! Reply Gina says: November 13, 2020 at 11:31 AM Omg Derek’s bk plz i hope.Actually jumped off my seat.Luved it.Can’t wait for the next episode Reply Mike says: November 12, 2020 at 8:09 PM Has this show hired fan fiction writers to replace the writer’s room? Jackson and Jo..seriously? None of Jackson’s hookups post April have worked, the actor seems to lack chemistry with everyone else which is unfortunate because he’s so pretty. Bring back April for him or get rid of him, he’s dead weight and just being thrown around in pairings to see what works and nothings working. Amelia and Link are cute, could care less about Owen, Teddy and Tom. Now that ending…is Mer on deaths door again? Shout out to the cast and crew for keeping Patrick’s cameo? Return? under wraps! Never ever thought we’d seen him back although this is very soap opera-ish. 2.6/5 stars for season 17 premiere Reply Nicole says: November 14, 2020 at 3:51 PM My mom says the writers have run out of storylines and Mer has Izzy’s brain tumor. Reply Matt C. says: November 12, 2020 at 8:09 PM Um, yes, that ending definitely lived up to the hype. I can’t believe they got Patrick Dempsey back! The next episode is going to be wild. Loved the premiere episodes. They did a great job at mixing the flashbacks of the unaired episodes in with the new COVID storylines. This was probably the best season opener they’ve had in years! Reply Alyson says: November 12, 2020 at 8:09 PM I was good until that last minute. Ugghhh. Reply screenname says: November 12, 2020 at 8:13 PM Did Patrick Dempsey actually film new material or is this more CGI crap like his other appearances?? Reply Meg says: November 12, 2020 at 8:18 PM He filmed new material. Ellen has pics on her social media from when they were filming together. Reply Ms. M says: November 12, 2020 at 8:32 PM It is a pleasant surprise to see an actor actually return to Grey’s after an abrupt departure.  There’s been a lot of burnt bridges between actors and this show.  Obviously this is short term but a little closure is a nice thing. Reply Meg says: November 12, 2020 at 8:41 PM Deadline has a really good article that talks about bringing Patrick back. They talked a little bit about his return after that abrupt departure. They even brought back the guy who did Patrick’s hair! Reply Bill says: November 13, 2020 at 1:01 AM Yeah.  My shock was not in seeing “Derek Shepherd”, but in seeing Patrick Dempsey return. Reply Anthony Dedrick says: November 12, 2020 at 8:37 PM It’s him. The Instagram account posted a picture of he and Ellen Pompeo together and confirmed it’s him Reply Mackenzie says: November 12, 2020 at 10:55 PM I believe he actually came back Reply TESSA LINDSEY says: November 12, 2020 at 11:44 PM Yes he is really there for an episode or two Reply Sam S says: November 17, 2020 at 8:16 AM According to Showrunner Krista Vernoff they got Patrick Dempsey for a day and they made the most of it.  Four scenes in all, one scene episode 2 and the remaining three in episode 3 this coming THursday.  It is not CGI. Reply Denise Neicy says: November 12, 2020 at 8:23 PM So glad the show followed up on the human trafficking storyline from S16.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised that Grey’s handling of Covid is so realistic.  But please stop trying to couple up Jackson with anyone (Jo WTF).  Glad Deluca got the help he needed.  Teddy & Owen….that’s a wrap.  Korasick’s demotion was overdue.  Maggie & Winston budding romance should be interesting.  The ending with Meredith & Derek…OMG!!! Reply Anthony Dedrick says: November 12, 2020 at 8:39 PM I was too in regards to the human trafficking story. That story left a bad taste in my mouth with it’s lack of resolution. So I’m glad we got that Reply JP says: November 12, 2020 at 8:24 PM So what’s wrong with Meredith?  Is this going to be like Izzy and a brain tumor?  I was surprised and happy to see Derick but I don’t want Meredith to leave.  I believe she is supposed to stay until at least the end of the season but look what happened to Alex.  I can’t wait for next week. Reply lisa says: November 12, 2020 at 8:37 PM Most likely she has covid Reply JP says: November 12, 2020 at 9:07 PM I guess I didn’t think of COVID because she got so bad so quickly but I should have.  And she does have a history herself of seeing dead people when she is in peril. Reply Annie says: November 12, 2020 at 8:25 PM Seeing Derek was as good as when George Clooney snuck back for ER Reply reree says: November 13, 2020 at 8:52 AM That’s exactly what I thought. Reply wvugirl2007 says: November 12, 2020 at 8:27 PM They surprised me for the first time in years. I was expecting a lot of things. Some happened, some didn’t. I did not expect Derek. That one had me silent screaming with my hands pointing at the tv so I wouldn’t scare my dogs. Reply AMCh says: November 12, 2020 at 8:30 PM Yes. Absolutely. I clutched my heart and  it sent me off! Both episodes were amazing and satisfying and left me happy crying mostly …. and now I’m shocked and scared and AHHHH!!! Reply Colette says: November 12, 2020 at 8:52 PM I recently just finished season 16 so this was the first episode I’ve seen live, and  it was incredible! I love their take on the pandemic, and I WAS SHOCKED when I saw Derek! God I miss him so much!!!!!! Reply B. Barned says: November 12, 2020 at 9:06 PM It was boring to say the least! A real let down. They all seemed to be trying too hard. Redundant run of the mill stuff. How did Meredith’s kids grow up years in a few months???? Meredith lying on the ground in parking lot was anti climactic. Better if Owen had backed out in his usual rage and run her down!! Reply JP says: November 12, 2020 at 9:10 PM Grow years in a few months?  That’s how old they are supposed to be.  We don’t see them that often but I’m pretty sure they were around the same age last season. Reply Diana Prallon says: November 13, 2020 at 11:18 AM They literally have had the same actors (a part of identical twins) playing Bailey since 2016 – so, you know, they can’t be growing faster than reality. Reply MLB16 says: November 13, 2020 at 11:49 AM It only seems that way because we rarely see the kids. In fact, it took me 20 minutes to realize he was Meredith’s son. I was trying to figure out how Amelia had an older kid. Reply JP says: November 12, 2020 at 9:11 PM It’s funny because so many people were talking about Derek the entire second hour because they wanted Amelia to name her son after him and then he shows up at the end.  I bet the writers did that on purpose. Reply Carol says: November 12, 2020 at 9:31 PM Mostly excellent premiere. The first half felt disjointed, like scenes were out of sequence. First we see Richard talking to Kaden’s mom, the next thing he’s at the intervention for Andrew, next he’s back with Kaden’s mom. Thankfully, the second half flowed better. And that ending! OMG! Yes! Reply JL says: November 13, 2020 at 2:41 AM They were using scenes from the episodes that were partially filmed but not done from the spring as flashbacks, so that they could finish those storylines. But they flashed the date so big once, it would have been nice to have more date cues. I finally realized I had to watch for masks or no masks to figure out what was happening when. Reply Diana Prallon says: November 13, 2020 at 11:14 AM Well, it also has an auditory rewind sound effect when they start flashback scenes… Reply Antwon303 says: November 12, 2020 at 9:34 PM What a wonderful surprise. Derek. Mer has reunited with her McDreamy. I know she’s only dreaming but it was so good to see him and it continues next week :-) This premiere was a bit exhausting. I do applaud them for the realism. But man oh man we def need to applaud and appreciate our medical professionals. I am sure what we saw in this episode is just the tip of the iceberg. I hope it makes people think more and make better decisions because this pandemic has us on in a vice grip. I am glad they picked up on the story of Andrew and the human trafficking story. I also like the bi-polar story. Giacomo is acting his butt off. I am still team Meluca.  I don’t want her with the other doctor. His personality is not something Mer would go for. Sure Derek was an arrogant prick at times but he also knew how to be charming. I haven’t seen what’s his name exhibit even an ounce of charm. I wonder if they are going to go there with Jo and Jackson. I can’t believe she flat-out asked him to hit the sheets with her. Not the best premiere but I was not bored. It was just a lot but they said that the pandemic would be written into the show. I am okay with it. I’m sure it won’t be the entire season but on a medical show–I think they would be remiss to ignore COVID. I missed my show. So glad to have new episodes. Reply Bill says: November 13, 2020 at 1:13 AM If Jo and Jackson become a thing, it would be the first time two long-running characters on the show became an item after several years of platonic friendship (not even close), with neither one of them secretly pining for the other during much of that time (e.g. Teddy for Owen).  I wouldn’t guess whether they become a couple.  However, I could see the scheduled hookup turning into a less-embarrassing George O’Malley/Meredith Grey season 2 situation as soon as Jo and Jackson agreed to it.  It’s probably for the best that it didn’t go beyond kissing. Reply Karen says: November 12, 2020 at 9:40 PM These Grey’s episodes were great. I have watched with my daughter since the beginning and tonight I was yelling it’s Derek!!!! Reply bob marley's ghost says: November 12, 2020 at 9:49 PM It think COVID saved Grey’s! Last season was beyond awful and so was the one before that. I haven’t enjoyed grey’s in years before these two episodes. They were actually watchable. Hopefully the keep it up, and it doesn’t go downhill from here. The Teddy and Owen storyline needs to wrap up once and for all. That’s my only issue. Put Teddy with a woman! Last season showed she’s at least bi, right? Reply Katie says: November 12, 2020 at 9:53 PM Excellent recap. Can you consider removing the word “powwow” from it? Reply Lola says: November 13, 2020 at 12:46 AM This episode was way too confusing with all the flashbacks and missing pieces. It’s been what, seven months since we saw the last episode. I’m still trying to bring back to memory how we left off, and then I have to deal with this confusing mishmash of events. Like, I forgot what Teddy decided after her up-against-the-lockers sex with Tom, for starters. Meh. Reply Angela says: November 13, 2020 at 1:31 AM They shouldn’t have killed Derek.. and he shouldn’t have left the show.. The chemistry between Patrick and Ellen is unbelievable.. And they were the core of the show..
