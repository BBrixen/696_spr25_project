He works primarily for the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) and has officiated six major finals. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) certified him as a gold badge umpire in 2007. Known for his baritone voice, Nouni is sometimes called the " Barry White of tennis". Early life [ edit ] Nouni was born to Algerian-French immigrants on 23 February 1976. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] He grew up in the Haut Vernet quarter of Perpignan , in southern France. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Nouni and his older brother were raised in public housing by a single mother after his father died when he was two. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Nouni and his brother took up tennis in the wake of Frenchman Yannick Noah 's victory at the 1983 French Open . [ 4 ] Costs associated with tennis (lessons, court rental, etc.) meant Nouni needed to work from a young age; by age nine, he strung rackets, swept the court lines, and did other jobs at a local tennis club. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Local tournaments hired him to officiate adult matches from age 12. [ 5 ] Nouni recalled that despite his youth, early on he got positive feedback from players for his umpiring skills. [ 4 ] Nouni developed his trademark deep voice by his mid-teens; he recalled an incident when a girlfriend's father did not believe that he was only sixteen because of his voice over the phone. [ 5 ] Career [ edit ] As a 16-year-old, Nouni got his first major umpiring experience as a line judge at the 1992 French Open , after having been recognized for good officiating at a junior tennis event held the previous year at the Roland Garros stadium complex in Paris. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Before dedicating himself to officiating, Nouni briefly studied sociology at the university level. [ 4 ] Nouni worked his way as a chair umpire from qualifying competitions, to the main draws of WTA and Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) events, to Grand Slams . [ 6 ] He became a full-time umpire in 2005; in off-seasons past, Nouni sometimes supplemented his income by working in bars in his hometown of Perpignan. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] He earned ITF accreditation over time: his white badge (Level 2) in 1998, bronze badge (Level 3) in 2002, silver badge in 2004, and gold badge (highest level) in 2007. [ 4 ] He joined the WTA Tour exclusively in 2008, but still sometimes officiates men's matches at Grand Slams. [ 2 ] [ 4 ] Nouni has umpired five women's singles finals at the French Open: in 2007 , 2009 , 2013 , 2014 , and 2021 . Outside of Roland Garros, the only other major final he has officiated was the 2018 Wimbledon Championships . [ 5 ] [ 4 ] His other high-profile matches on the WTA Tour include presiding over four season-ending WTA Finals finals. [ 4 ] Nouni has been involved in several notable moments of controversy. [ 5 ] At the 2012 Australian Open , after Nouni overruled a line judge to award John Isner an ace and declined to allow a late Hawk-Eye challenge, David Nalbandian argued at length with Nouni and said postmatch that the umpire had mismanaged that moment. [ 5 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] At the 2015 French Open , Victoria Azarenka thought she had saved a set point after a miss by Serena Williams , but because a line judge made a late incorrect call on Azarenka's previous shot, Nouni had the players replay the point (instead of awarding it to Azarenka outright). [ 9 ] At the 2023 French Open , Nouni missed a double bounce on Holger Rune 's side and then penalised Francisco Cerúndolo for stopping mid-court as a ball kid began to run on, also thinking the point was over. [ 10 ] Recognition [ edit ] Nouni's deep baritone voice, fashion sense, and personality have helped make him one of the most famous tennis umpires today. [ 2 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The Guardian writes, "With his smoky tones, he's been praised for having the best voice in tennis". [ 11 ] Other sources describe his tone as "honeyed", "resonant and melodic", "seductive", and "soothing", and note his thick French accent. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Nouni's pronunciation of " deuce " is especially striking to some fans. [ 6 ] [ 13 ] John McEnroe once joked, "[Nouni]'s got the great voice, I'll give him that ... He's an argument for smoking cigarettes if you're an umpire". [ 6 ] Nouni used to worry that his voice could distract from his job, noting "We always say that a good official is someone that we don't talk about", but has since come to appreciate the fan interest. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Because of his deep voice, he is sometimes referred to as the " Barry White of tennis". [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Personal life [ edit ] Nouni met his wife, Melanie Conesa, in 2010. They have two children. [ 4 ] As of 2018 [update] , when Nouni is not traveling, he lives with his family in Perpignan. [ 1 ] References [ edit ] ^ a b c Gomes, Alaric (22 February 2018).
