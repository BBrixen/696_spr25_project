Jan 10, 2025 · Updated on Why GPT-4 is leagues ahead of GPT-3, from model size to multimodality. Botpress What’s with all the new models these days? If you’re trying to figure out which ChatGPT model to use for your project, it can be tough to understand all the differences. When GPT-4 was released, it blew its predecessor out of the water. Here’s everything you need to know about how GPT-4 stacks up against GPT-3. What is ChatGPT? ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) and developed by OpenAI. It uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to understand input and provide relevant output – just like a human conversation. GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer is a sophisticated neural network architecture used to train LLMs. It makes use of large amounts of publicly-available Internet data to simulate human communication.

Feature GPT-3 GPT-4 Model Size 175 billion parameters 1.8 trillion parameters Modality Text Text and image (+ voice and audio capabilities in GPT-4o) Content Window 2048 tokens 128k tokens Reasoning Bottom 10% of successful test-takers Top 10% of successful test-takers Price Free Free 1. 10x Bigger model size GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, whereas GPT-4 has 1.8 trillion parameters. How? The GPT-4 architecture consists of 8 models, each of which is made up of 220 billion parameters. 2. Addition of multimodality GPT-3 is unimodal, so it can only process and generate text. GPT-4, on the other hand, has the ability to process both text and images. And GPT-4o introduced a combination of text, audio, image, and video formats – much more multimodal than its predecessor! 3. Much bigger context window GPT-3 has a context window size of 2048 tokens. GPT-4 has a context window size of 128k tokens. The context window refers to how many tokens of text that a model can process – the bigger the context window, the more input it can handle. 4. Better reasoning and problem-solving On a number of standardized tests, GPT-3.5 was in the bottom 10% of passing candidates. But according to OpenAI’s tests , GPT-4 ranks in the top 10% of passing candidates. 5. Same pricing Both the GPT-3 and GPT-4 models are free to use via ChatGPT. What can I use GPT for? With some imagination and technical know-how, there's no limit to the applications of GPT in your work or personal life. Companies are using the GPT engine to power sales chatbots , HR software , and even as personal therapists. Here are a few of the most common ways users are making the most of ChatGPT: Personal assistant Need someone to handle your daily tasks without the small talk? GPT can help draft emails, set reminders, plan trips, or even come up with dinner ideas. It’s like having a personal assistant that’s never late and doesn’t need coffee breaks. Customer service Tired of answering the same questions over and over? More organizations are using GPT-powered customer support chatbots to handle customer inquiries and troubleshoot issues. Think of it as a 24/7 support agent that always has the right answer. Content creation From blog posts to social media captions, GPT can help you write faster and better. Stuck on ideas? It’ll brainstorm. Need a full draft? It’s got you covered. It won’t replace your voice, but it can definitely speed things up. Data Analysis GPT can summarize reports, pull insights from spreadsheets, or even help you make sense of complex data sets. It’s like having an analyst who cuts through the noise and gives you the highlights. Coding Help Stuck on a coding problem? GPT can help debug your code, suggest improvements, or even write entire scripts. Code review and code generation bots have become mainstream for devs of all industries. History of ChatGPT Models While OpenAI produced LLMs GPT-2 and GPT-3, it wasn’t until GPT-3.5 that these models began to power ChatGPT. GPT-3.5 Released in November of 2022, GPT-3.5 was the world’s first introduction to ChatGPT. GPT-3.5 Turbo The 2023 Turbo model updated improved the accuracy of ChatGPT’s responses, although it used a similar model to 3.5. GPT-4 March of 2023 saw the release of a more advanced model. Compared to GPT-3, GPT-4 was more powerful and better optimized. It also introduced ChatGPT Plus to paying users. GPT-4 Turbo Released in November 2023, OpenAI launched a version of GPT-4 that included a far larger context window than its predecessor. GPT-4o GPT-4o was released in May 2024, the first truly multimodal LLM from OpenAI. The ‘o’ stood for ‘omni’, a nod to the model’s ability to analyze and generate text, images, and sound. Notably, the 4o model was twice as fast and half the cost of GPT-4 Turbo, and was made available to all ChatGPT users (with a usage limit). GPT-4o Mini The Mini version of GPT-4o was released in July the same year. Its API costs were even lower than the original 4o model, and it replaced GPT-3.5 Turbo as the standard model for ChatGPT users. OpenAI o1-preview Building OpenAI o1 ‍The latest release from OpenAI was the new o1 series , debuted September 12, 2024 after a highly-anticipated launch lead-up. The preview model became immediately available on ChatGPT, albeit with low usage limits. The o1 models are the first LLMs that claim to reason. If the o1 model is given a prompt, it won’t answer immediately – hence the long wait time. Instead, it will reason through each of the steps, carefully considering each piece of information and its implications before deciding on the next course of action. It won't provide an answer until it has thought through the entire series of steps required. OpenAI o1-mini The o1-mini is smaller than o1-preview and 80% cheaper. It’s built for everyday tasks that require advanced reasoning, like coding or mathematics. GPT-5 Users are unsure whether the latest o1 launch is the replacement or the predecessor for the long-awaited GPT-5 model . It may be until the next OpenAI launch that they receive confirmation. What does it mean for users and businesses? GPT-4 can generate vast amounts of content at a blinding speed, allowing companies to operate various aspects of their business with the help of artificial intelligence. Businesses that get a hold of GPT-4 gain the capacity to generate content automatically, saving time and money while increasing their outreach. Since the technology can work with any kind of text, the practical applications of GTP-4 are practically limitless. How can GPT grow my business? GPT-4's focus on functionality translates into an increase in operational efficiency. Businesses can use AI to upscale their customer support efforts, their content generation strategies, and even to improve sales and marketing activities. GPT-4 empowers businesses to: Create large volumes of content Next-generation, advanced language models enable businesses to create high-quality content at a very quick pace. For example, a company can rely on artificial intelligence to generate social media content on a consistent basis. This helps a business keep a good online presence without having to put much thought into it. Enhance customer support capabilities AIs capable of producing human-like responses are incredibly useful for customer support. By producing clear responses to customer queries, AI solutions can handle the vast majority of common customer support situations. This helps reduce the amount of support tickets while also providing customers with a more direct method of getting answers. ‍ Personalize the marketing experience Thanks to GPT-4, it will be easier to create advertisement content that caters to varied demographics. AI can generate targeted content and ads that are more relevant to the people who will consume them. This strategy can help increase conversion rates among online users.
