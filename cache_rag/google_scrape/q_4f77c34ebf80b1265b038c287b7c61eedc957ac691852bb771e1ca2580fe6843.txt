In early 2020, when the pandemic began, I was relegated to being homebound and was soon restless. It was my love for photography and a necessity to break the boredom of isolation that gave me the idea of photographing my neighbor. I was happy to be shooting again. I applied the same process I was accustomed to for my commercial projects to the neighborhood portrait workflow: meet, location scout, plan, shoot. I had a skeleton crew which was myself and sometimes my wife, Susan, one camera, and one light. Once I posted my first portrait on social media, others began contacting me, asking to be included. The initial portrait was evolving to become bigger than my original intention. Being immersed in this growing project for myself as well others now had more meaning. It was having a positive impact with others on a personal level, introducing people to each other.  Conversations were being initiated between neighbors who had not previously met, referencing each other’s portrait. On walks through the canyon, at the café or market, people came up to me asking to be photographed or to refer a friend who wanted to be included. This was now our collaborative neighborhood project. The series, first titled, 19 Stories, as a reference to Covid-19, grew beyond the single image to a tribute that celebrates the Centennial of Hollywoodland: 100 Years/100 Stories. This body of work is dedicated to the wonderful families and individuals that are part of this special place in Los Angeles that we call home, an area that is brimming with wildlife, flora, and creativity that collectively make Hollywoodland all that it is. xo jim View fullsize In this photo, these residents of Hollywoodland are celebrating their neighborhood's Centennial, marking a hundred years since its inception in the same spot where the visionaries and developers posed for its inaugural historic photo. Surrounded by the vibrant energy of LA, Hollywoodland still feels like a peaceful getaway tucked away in the canyon surrounded by natural beauty. View fullsize Kelly Kathleen -       "I live in an enchanted turn-of-the-century building that serves as an unofficial artist enclave. Life here is wrapped in raspberry-colored bougainvillea and tendril-climbing emerald vines. Coyotes howl, and French doors creek while stained glass stares on like a voyeur. Quirky neighbors point out portals to other dimensions and tell stories about the resident ghost cat that I have yet to encounter at the time of print. Beachwood Canyon is a bizarre beauty; it's hard not to fall under its spell." View fullsize Alex Papalexis -       "The thoughtful intention that went into designing this hillside community one hundred years ago has stood the test of time well,  from the architectural style of its initial homes to the inclusion of a central business and commercial center, which was made more easily accessible to many of the upper streets by the presence of numerous stairways which link upper streets to lower streets. As Hollywoodland marks its one-hundredth year, the Beachwood Market marks its ninetieth year. It's a privilege to continue the tradition of being the local market and serving the fine and diverse people that make up this neighborhood and community. A tradition started by relatives so long ago." View fullsize Jacqui and Aldo King with Gunther -       Jacqueline and Aldo have lived in Beachwood Canyon since 2017. Jacqui is an electronic musician, and Aldo works in tech. Gunther joined the family in 2020. "He's too smart for his own good!" All three like to hike through the canyon every morning.

View fullsize Jason Matzoukas -       Jason is a much-loved comedic actor, writer, and podcaster. "I don't always like this city. In fact, some days, I fucking hate it. But then, the minute I turn onto Beachwood, my shoulders go down, there are no more muttering expletives under my breath, and I stop giving people the finger, except for that one dude, who knows what he did!" Inspo for this photograph was the Alfred Hitchcock movie Rear Window. The voyeurism, narratives, and symbolism in the movie seem a parallel for the forced isolation during the pandemic due to the virus turning the lens of our normally myopic pursuits to daily life beyond the windows and into the windows and lives within our neighborhood. Like the movie, the photoshoot had its element of suspense, as everyone was waiting for me to fall off the ladder. View fullsize Aaron and Jennifer Curry with their dog, Hashtag-        Before moving to the Canyon in 2009, I had never seen the Hollywood sign in person, even though we had lived in LA for eight years.

As these plants flourish and grow, I feel that the magic of poetry is growing into my life." View fullsize Alan Faye with Sophie -       "Residing in the first building built in Hollywoodland has a certain magic that brings people together. I've always loved to entertain, which happens organically at Beachwood's crossroads. People we know meet people who join us on the patio and soon become old friends themselves. Sophie, my dog, has become a fixture herself, greeting neighbors and tourists from the patio and upper window with her smile and signature wiggle. Hollywoodland is an amazing community of truly special souls, with each day bringing a new adventure." View fullsize Bill Reichenbach -       "Music has been a constant in my life. I was born in 1949, soon after my father, a jazz drummer, left the Tommy Dorsey Band. I started playing drums at an early age. At eleven years old, I decided to learn to play trombones. I began playing along with the 78 records my father had around the house and became interested in arranging and composing. My goal had been to play in the recording studios as a professional musician. I came to LA to record with Chuck Mangione, an experience that solidified my plans to move here, which I did in 1975. I played with several big bands. I met Jerry Hey, a great trumpet player, and arranger. We started scoring part business with composers such as John Williams, Alan Silvestri, and Michael Giacchino, to name a few. I've lived in Beachwood during this time, a wonderful place to come home to. My little corner of the bend in the road is a warm, welcoming small-town sitting above the massive city of Los Angeles. LA in the 20s is reminiscent of European architecture. You can see that influence, especially in Beachwood. This area is close to most of what happens in my business yet comfortably remote by being up in the hills. I've been very happy to live here for these many years". View fullsize Lindsey DeMay -       Costume designer, Lynds2y, describes her closets as "the window into my world, one is my personal, and the other is my work or kit closet." Lindsay moved to LA from New Orleans for work. "I was offered a job by a woman I worked with in New Orleans. While in LA, she introduced me to her friend, a photographer who lived on Beachwood Drive, and kept me busy working. That was my first experience with this magical place, and I knew instantly this was where I wanted to live someday. I walk the seemingly never-ending maze of streets with my dog, Sophia Louise. This is my form of meditation. A person can escape crazy Hollywood. The Hollywood Sign lets you sense you've entered the history of it all".

We have thirty-eight windows in our house and see the green from every one of them". Their second child, Milo, born in 2013, is a "lucky little sausage, having spent his entire life living in Beachwood Canyon. We love how close we are to the park, and with two rambunctious boys and two dogs, we need to assess to open space, especially valuable during this time of the pandemic. This place feels like home. It has from the moment we moved here. We love our neighbors, most of whom have lived here for twenty years or more. We get that. We have no intention of leaving either".

"Our family is three generations deep, living in Beachwood Cyn. We couldn’t imagine living anywhere else. The best place on Earth!

Beautiful sunny Southern California, where else would we ever want to be?"

After meeting in 2007 on a movie set, they lived in different apartments on Beachwood, developing a strong love for the area. "We used to walk the winding streets, peering into windows and gardens and marveled at how houses could be built on such extreme hillsides and dreamed of one day living in one of those stilt-balanced boxes." They married in 2019, had their son, Jude, and settled in Beachwood. "Within our first week, we'd met half the street. We love this area, primarily because of the mix of people: artists, geniuses, partiers, bookworms, even Brits." They have remained at home most of the time during covid isolation.

It's never lost on us how fortunate we are to live where we do," says Bethany, "and we feel lucky to have our teenage kids, Zane and Rex, so close for such a long duration of time.

After graduating from the Art Center College of Design, I have enjoyed working mostly as an Art Director in the entertainment industry. I've developed projects for The Directors Guild of America, Walt Disney Imagineering, and Mercedes-Benz of North America. In the late 1990s, my partner Joe, and I, began looking around for a home to buy after renting in the Cahuenga Pass. I was always attracted to living in The Hollywood Hills at an early age, inspired by the Bob Segar son Hollywood Nights. I dreamt of a home where I could stare down at the light of LA. Hillside homes are always unique. They require architects to create a functional home, working with the natural terrain. There are often mysterious decisions made that we homeowners are left to interpret. My home, built in 1926, had a puzzling room on the entry-level. A small bedroom with its own bathroom and a side door leading to the garage. I was told by a realtor it might have been a chauffeur's quarters. So, channeling Dorothy Draper, I turned it into what I call my Hollywood Regency-style library with blue walls and white furnishings. It's a quiet room with great morning light. I use it mostly for meditation. It's also a popular room with friends when I'm entertaining.

Many of us have been here for a long time, and our canyon community, with all its characters and quirks, reminds me of living in a small town.

That still holds true today. My home was one of the first to be built on Beachwood. To me, it exemplifies everything about this neighborhood: simple, tasteful, and timeless. A relaxing refuge. I told everyone I bought it because my dogs had a yard, so my cars had a driveway. And that was true. But sixteen years in, I can't imagine living anywhere else in Los Angeles.'

Nature and awareness can welcome you. I like that." In Beachwood, Geoffrey is recognized as The Barefooted Man. "It was after a long stay at the beach, where no one wears shoes, and it's summer all the time here in LA, that I decided to walk here barefoot in Beachwood. I started hiking almost as soon as I got here, first alone and then with friends. I've always been a runner, even as a musician, and I adjusted to long hikes in the hills. I was happy to end up in an area recognized by the great psychics back in the 20s and 30s. In fact, the Besant Lodge on Beachwood Drive remains to hold that consciousness. I'm attracted to those who are attracted to this creativity, consciously or not.
