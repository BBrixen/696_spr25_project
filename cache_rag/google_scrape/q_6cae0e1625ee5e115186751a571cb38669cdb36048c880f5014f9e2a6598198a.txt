Members Online • SexyBlueTiger Repurchasing AC Valhalla on Steam // Question I'm wondering if anyone who owned AC Valhalla on Ubisoft Connect originally, repurchased it on Steam? If so could you share your experience? Did your gear purchased with opals get shared across the 2 copies? Achievements? Save file? Was there any issues? I know this is stupid, but now that AC Valhalla has Steam achievements, I want to have AC Origins, AC Odyssey, and AC Valhalla all in Steam with my Steam achievements. Ubisoft support has been absolutely useless in giving me a straight answer, seems like they only give templated responses and won't/can't answer the finer details of the question. They also tend to give contradicting responses as it never seems the same support person responds to the ticket twice. Read more New to Reddit?
