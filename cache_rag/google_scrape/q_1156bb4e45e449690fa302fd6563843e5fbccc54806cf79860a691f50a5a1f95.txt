Enter at your own risk… best to stay clear of the fog. Members Online • [deleted] There is absolutely no way del Torro said that without being scripted to. I am completely convinced that Kojima is involved in a Silent Hill project now. News Kojima announced Guillermo del Toro’s latest movie… then Guillermo del Toro responded by saying Silent Hill had great art direction and that he hopes to see another Silent Hill someday. Whilst clearly reading from a script. They worked together in the past to create PT, a Silent Hill entry and the latest rumours suggest Kojima and del Toro are again working on a Silent Hill entry. That comment was entirely intentional. Del Toro has voiced his disappointment in PT never coming to fruition and neither Kojima or himself have discussed it to any real capacity in years. Now he acknowledges Silent Hill when it has no relation to the given context and was entirely unprompted… whilst reading from a script… at The Game Awards 2021… If Kojima was still on bad terms with Konami and their Silent Hill project was doomed to go unreleased… then why bring it up at all unless it’s a teaser for an actual revitalised project? For better or worse… I am completely convinced that Silent Hill will return helmed by Kojima and del Toro. Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
