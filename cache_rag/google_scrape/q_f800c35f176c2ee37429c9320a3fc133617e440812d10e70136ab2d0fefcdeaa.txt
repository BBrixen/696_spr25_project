By ATP Staff The ATP today published the 2023 year-end Pepperstone ATP Rankings on ATPTour.com with Novak Djokovic finishing as ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by Pepperstone for a record-extending eighth time. After a back-and-forth battle with Carlos Alcaraz throughout the season, Djokovic clinched the honour at the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin. The Serbian is now two year-end No. 1 finishes clear of the player with the second-most year-end No. 1 finishes, Pete Sampras (6). The 36-year-old now owns the three oldest ATP Year-End No. 1 honours in history (since 1973) after accomplishing the feat as a 33-year-old in 2020 and a 34-year-old in 2021. The Monday after winning his seventh Nitto ATP Finals , Djokovic began his historic 400th week atop the Pepperstone ATP Rankings. Only Roger Federer (310 weeks) has also eclipsed the 300-weeks milestone. Djokovic tied Federer for the most year-end finishes in the Top 3 with 15. This is Djokovic's 402nd week atop the Pepperstone ATP Rankings and he is guaranteed to remain No. 1 through the week of 22 January. The winner of a Tour-leading seven titles this season, Djokovic held the top spot for 28 weeks across four stints. He first returned to No. 1 after winning the Australian Open , less than three months after falling to No. 8. The top spot switched seven times in 2023 between Djokovic and Alcaraz, the most No. 1 changes since 2018, when there were also seven. The only years in which it switched more often were 1983 (10) and 1999 (8). The man he exchanged No. 1 with throughout the year, Alcaraz, finished in the year-end Top 2 for the second consecutive year. Twenty-year-old Holger Rune ended the season at No. 8. It is the first time two players aged 20 or younger completed a year in the Top 10 since 20-year-old Marat Safin (No. 2) and 19-year-old Lleyton Hewitt (No. 7) in 2000. Rune is the lone new face in the year-end Top 10 after climbing to a career-high No. 4 in August. He is the first Danish player in Pepperstone ATP Rankings history (since 1973) to finish in the year-end Top 10. Frances Tiafoe was the only player in 2023 who cracked the Top 10 for the first time when he ascended to No. 10 in June. It is the second consecutive season in which an American made his Top 10 debut. Taylor Fritz did so last year and has now finished in the Top 10 for two consecutive years. Nine of the players in the year-end Top 10 are aged 27 or under, with an average age of just older than 25. The 22-year-old Jannik Sinner , at a career-high No. 4, joins Alcaraz and Rune to make a trio of Top 10 players aged 22 and under. It is the first time three 22-and-under players have finished in the year-end Top 10 since 2009, when 22-year-old Djokovic (No. 3), 22-year-old Andy Murray (No. 4) and 21-year-old Juan Martin del Potro (No. 5) did it. 2023 YEAR-END PEPPERSTONE ATP RANKINGS TOP 10 1) Novak Djokovic – Earns record-extending eighth ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by Pepperstone and leads ATP Tour with seven titles. 2) Carlos Alcaraz – Finishes in the Top 2 for the second consecutive year, wins second major title at Wimbledon . 3) Daniil Medvedev – Finishes in year-end Top 3 for the second time in three years. 4) Jannik Sinner – Climbs to career-high No. 4, claimed maiden ATP Masters 1000 trophy in Toronto. 5) Andrey Rublev – Finishes in Top 5 after winning first ATP Masters 1000 title in Monte-Carlo. 6) Stefanos Tsitsipas – Earns fifth straight year-end Top 10 finish. 7) Alexander Zverev – Returns to the Top 10 after suffering a devastating ankle injury in June 2022. 8) Holger Rune – After reaching career-high No. 4, qualified for Nitto ATP Finals for the first time. 9) Hubert Hurkacz – Finishes in year-end Top 10 for third straight year after leading the Tour in aces (1,031). 10) Taylor Fritz – No. 1 American won both finals played, secures second Top 10 finish. 2023 Year-End Pepperstone ATP Rankings Quick Facts 504 spots jumped by Alex Michelsen – most in year-end Top 100 (No. 601 in 2022 to No. 97 in 2023). 213 spots jumped by Arthur Fils – most in year-end Top 50 (No. 249 in 2022 to No. 36 in 2023). 38-year-old Stan Wawrinka is oldest player in year-end Top 100 at No. 50.

With Fils and Van Assche, it is the first time two French teens have ended a year in the Top 100 since Richard Gasquet and Gael Monfils , both then 19, in 2005.

Nine players in year-end Top 10 have competed in or qualified for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by NEOM in their careers. 10 players from the United States in year-end Top 100 – the most of any country.
