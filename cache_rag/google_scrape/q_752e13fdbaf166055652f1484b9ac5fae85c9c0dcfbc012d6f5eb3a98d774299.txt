Each panel of analysts comprises one left-leaning, one right-leaning, and one center-leaning analyst. The team considers a variety of factors when rating content.

We add each of these scores to the chart on a weighted scale, with the average of those creating the sample content’s overall reliability score.

The bias rating, demonstrated on the Media Bias Chart ®️ on the horizontal axis, ranges from most extreme left to middle to most extreme right. The reliability rating, demonstrated on the chart’s vertical axis, rates sources on a scale from original fact reporting to analysis, opinion, propaganda and inaccurate/fabricated information. Reliability scores for articles and shows are on a scale of 0-64. Scores above 40 are generally good; scores below 24 are generally problematic. Scores between 24-40 indicate a range of possibilities, with some sources falling there because they are heavy in opinion and analysis, and some because they have a high variation in reliability between articles.
