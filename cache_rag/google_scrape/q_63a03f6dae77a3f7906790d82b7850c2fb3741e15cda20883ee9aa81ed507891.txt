It's never too early for speculation and predictions - and Collider has just published some. 12 Movies That Could Be in Next Year’s Oscar Race Quote: The Irishman Much like Roma last year, The Irishman is the “heavy hitter” at this early stage. It’s a passion project gangster drama for Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese that chronicles the life of a hitman and his associates over the course of a number of decades. Cutting-edge de-aging technology will allow Oscar winners Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino to play their characters at various ages, which also makes this an early frontrunner for that Best Visual Effects Oscar if the quality is there. Oh yeah, and it boasts a screenplay by Oscar-winning Schindler’s List writer Steven Zaillian. The one big question mark with regards to The Irishman is its distributor, which is Netflix. Roma failed to clinch the big prize this year, and one wonders if there still exists an “anti-Netflix” sentiment in the Academy. Netflix has already committed to a theatrical release for The Irishman, and in contrast to the harder sell of Roma, one imagines this one could be a bona fide box office hit if given the platform. A lot of question marks on this one, but given the pedigree involved I’m expecting this to be a major player. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood This one checks a whole lot of Academy boxes. It’s a new Quentin Tarantino movie, it’s about Hollywood, it has an absolutely stacked ensemble cast, and it’s led by two of the biggest movie stars on the planet. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as a famous Western TV show star and Brad Pitt is his stunt double, and together the two confront a rapidly evolving Hollywood landscape in 1969. While Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained both earned Best Picture nominations, Tarantino’s last film—the contained Western The Hateful Eight—failed to earn notice in the big category. So there are no guarantees, and Sony Pictures will have to be in this for the long haul since Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a summer release, but if the film has the goods it could score a number of nominations. Us Writer/director Jordan Peele burst onto the scene with his brilliant horror thriller Get Out, which earned him an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay as well as nominations for Best Picture and Best Director. So even though his next social thriller Us comes out in March—which isn’t traditionally “awards season”—we’d be dumb not to consider it a potential contender. The film’s twists and turns are under wraps, but it’ll be interesting to see if it earns similar acclaim and can also stay the course though the long haul of Oscar season. Little Women The same year Jordan Peele earned Oscar nominations for Best Director, Original Screenplay, and Best Picture, Greta Gerwig did as well for her own directorial debut Lady Bird. She’s back this year with an A-list adaptation of the classic novel Little Women, starring Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Timothée Chalamet, and oh yeah Meryl Streep. The film has a prime holiday release date set up, so it’s definitely one to watch out for. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood The Mister Rogers documentary Won’t You Be My Neighbor? was famously snubbed a Best Documentary Feature nomination this year, but it could be a different story with the fictional take on the iconic TV host. Can You Ever Forgive Me? filmmaker Marielle Heller directs A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, which stars Matthew Rhys as a jaded journalist who’s assigned a profile of Mister Rogers. None other than Tom Hanks fills the sweater in this biopic, and he could earn his first Oscar nomination since 2000’s Cast Away. The Woman in the Window While the author of the source material for The Woman in the Window has come under a bit of fire recently, the film adaptation has pedigree to spare. Director Joe Wright is just coming off his big Oscar contender Darkest Hour, acclaimed playwright Tracy Letts wrote the script, and six-time Oscar nominee Amy Adams is in the lead role of an agoraphobic woman with a penchant for spying on her neighbors. Could this finally be Adams’ year? Rocketman/Yesterday/Blinded by the Light Bohemian Rhapsody shocked many with its impressive performance on the awards circuit last year, so it stands to reason a couple of this year’s music-centric films could be in the mix next year. The closest comparison comes by way of Rocketman, a biopic of Elton John directed by Dexter Fletcher, who finished out Bohemian Rhapsody after Bryan Singer was fired. And unlike Oscar-winner Rami Malek, Taron Egerton does his own singing! Then there’s Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire filmmaker Danny Boyle’s Yesterday, in which a man suffers head trauma only to wake up in a world in which he’s the only person who remembers The Beatles. Finally, there’s the Sundance hit Blinded by the Light, a heartwarming true story about a British-Pakistani teenager who discovers the music of Bruce Springsteen and decides to lead his life according to Springsteen’s lyrics. It’s an out-and-out crowdpleaser. The Report In the realm of political dramas, The Report seems primed to be a major contender. Contagion and Side Effects screenwriter Scott Z. Burns’ directorial debut chronicles the report commissioned by Dianne Feinstein to investigate the CIA’s use of torture in the wake of 9/11. The film was a massive hit at Sundance, with Adam Driver’s lead performance drawing raves alongside Annette Bening’s portrayal of Feinstein. This is a no-nonsense procedural with zero fluff or fat, and could very well be this year’s Spotlight. Untitled James Mangold Film The starpower of Christian Bale and Matt Damon will give the DiCaprio/Pitt team-up a run for their money. Bale and Damon lead Logan and Walk the Line director James Mangold’s drama about the race for Ford to build a vehicle to compete with Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France. 20th Century Fox recently moved the film out of a summer release into November, which is a sign they may be bullish on the film’s awards prospects. Star Wars: Episode IX Star Wars: A New Hope remains the only Star Wars movie nominated for Best Picture, but it feels prudent to at least address the possibility that J.J. Abrams’ closing chapter on this new trilogy could find itself in the Best Picture mix—again in the wake of blockbusters like Bohemian Rhapsody and Black Panther landing nods. The Force Awakens was well-received and The Last Jedi was downright critically acclaimed, so if Abrams sticks the landing, could there be enough goodwill to honor the entire trilogy with a nod for Episode IX? It’s unclear, but keep in mind Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King swept the Oscars back in 2003… Other Potential Contenders: The Last Thing He Wanted, Ad Astra, The Goldfinch, Late Night, The Kitchen, The Farewell, Knives Out Thanks given by: gkolb (03-01-2019), LordoftheRings (03-02-2019) Cremildo View Public Profile Send a private message to Cremildo Visit Cremildo's homepage!

Also, Spielberg said this week he plans to start shooting West Side Story in June, so I think that could be a potential year end contender (Munich and The Post were made in even tighter schedules). xbs2034 View Public Profile Send a private message to xbs2034 Find More Posts by xbs2034 03-01-2019, 03:29 PM # 3 Cremildo Blu-ray Archduke Member since: Jul 2011 Location: Brazil 4K collection: 150 Blu-ray collection: 1023 Trading Score: 49 I keep thinking about WSS , too. Spielberg is known for being a quick shooter ( ) and awards-hungry. That Collider article was a nice excuse to create this thread, but it's poorly researched.

Obviously Irishman and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood are right at the top of my list for this year (or at least only below Avengers: Endgame), and Us looks very good (just hoping Peele doesn't suffer a sophomore slump). Lots of potentially great mainstream releases this year, but of course I think the real contenders are going to be indies that we probably haven't even heard of yet.

They never actually cancelled it, they just postponed it pending further consideration. If there aren't any commercial hits that look like contenders by the time awards season starts, we might start hearing more about it. imsounoriginal View Public Profile Send a private message to imsounoriginal Find More Posts by imsounoriginal 03-01-2019, 03:57 PM # 11 Britnasty Blu-ray Knight Top contributor Member since: Feb 2008 Location: Milwaukee, WI 4K collection: 705 Blu-ray collection: 1903 Trading Score: 573 Probably Guaranteed: Best Actress - Cynthia Erivo as Harriet Tubman in Harriet Maybe: Best Supporting Actress - Janelle Monae in Harriet Britnasty View Public Profile Send a private message to Britnasty Visit Britnasty's homepage!

Id also place The Goldfinch amongst them as dead certs. I think Us will wind up being too much of a genre film for the Academy, with Peele talking heavily about its mythology. Im also a little skeptical as to the ballooning budget and Netflix backing of The Irishman. Rocketman I think comes out to early in the year and has a bit of an uphill battle after a bit of the backlash Bohemian Rhapsody has received, although they may see it as a way to honour Dexter Fletcher for his work in both films. I think Yesterday will mostly fade by the time Award Season comes around, Hanks will likely get a nod for sure for Mr. Rogers but I think the film will be largely shut out in the overall race. Id also have to wait and see what tone Knives Out will take as to whether its an awards contender or not, but it would be great to see Johnson get recognised after being a fan of his work for so long.

If the movie does catch on, I'd love for Daniel Craig to be in the awards conversation (assuming his performance merits it).

I won't include obvious stuff that was mentioned already. The Farewell - A Chinese family discover their grandmother has only a short while left to live and decide to keep her in the dark, scheduling a wedding to gather before she dies. Comedy. Release date: July. Screened to rave reviews in Sundance. Distributor: A24. Dry Run (not an official title) - A corporate defense attorney takes on an environmental lawsuit against a chemical company that exposes a lengthy history of pollution. Drama. Release date unknown. Will it take a non-LGBT project for Todd Haynes to be embraced by AMPAS? Distributor: unknown. 1917 - Plot unknown. The film will be set in 1917 during World War I. Drama, war. Release date: December. Co-written and directed by Sam Mendes. Distributor: Universal. Untitled Roger Ailes Project - A few women decide to take on Fox News boss Roger Ailes and the toxic male culture he presided over at the network. Biopic, drama. Release date: unknown. Timely subject matter. Distributor: unknown. Judy - Legendary performer Judy Garland arrives in London in the winter of 1968 to perform a series of sold-out concerts. Release date: unknown. Biopic of a troubled movie star, which sounds great on paper, but can the director deliver? Distributor: Roadside Attractions. Nomadland - A woman in her sixties who, after losing everything in the Great Recession, embarks on a journey through the American West, living as a van-dwelling modern-day nomad. Drama. Release date: IMDb says 2020. No reason to think this won't be released this year, as it's not a big production. Might be Chloé Zhao's big awards breakthrough, thanks to the presence of Frances McDormand, who will help bring attention to the film even if it's small. Distributor: Fox Searchlight Pictures. The Truth - About a stormy reunion between a daughter and her actress mother, Catherine, against the backdrop of Catherine's latest role in a sci-fi picture as a mother who never grows old. Drama.

Prestige material. Distributor: Warner. The Souvenir - A young film student in the early 80s becomes romantically involved with a complicated and untrustworthy man. Drama, romance. Release date: May. Already critically acclaimed. They might want to champion a female director. Will the critical enthusiasm last all year long, though? Distributor: A24. The Glorias: A Life on the Road - A feature film based on feminist icon Gloria Steinem's best selling memoir, My Life on the Road, telling the story of her itinerant childhood's influence on her life as a writer, activist and organizer for women's rights worldwide. Biopic. Release date: IMDb says 2020, but it's filming already so it could be ready in time for a qualifying run. Julie Taymor isn't exactly an Oscar magnet, but female- and feminism-driven films might appeal to the "new" Academy. Distributor: unknown. The Personal History of David Copperfield - Based on the novel by Charles Dickens. Drama. Release date: unknown. Prestige literary material. Could be Armando Iannucci's big Oscar break. Distributor: unknown. The Good Liar - Career con artist Roy Courtnay can hardly believe his luck when he meets well-to-do widow Betty McLeish online. As Betty opens her home and life to him, Roy is surprised to find himself caring about her, turning what should be a cut-and-dry swindle into the most treacherous tightrope walk of his life. Drama.
