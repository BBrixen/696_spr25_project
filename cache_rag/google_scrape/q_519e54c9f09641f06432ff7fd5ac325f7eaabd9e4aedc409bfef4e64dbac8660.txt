Snowboarding is an Olympic sport that has been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano , Japan . [ 1 ] Snowboarding was one of five new sports or disciplines added to the Winter Olympic programme between 1990 and 2002, and was the only one not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event. [ 2 ] In 1998, four events, two for men and two for women, were held in two specialities: the giant slalom, a downhill event similar to giant slalom skiing ; and the half-pipe , in which competitors perform tricks while going from one side of a semi-circular ditch to the other. [ 2 ] Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the men's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding. [ 3 ] Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after testing positive for marijuana . However, the IOC's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association. [ 4 ] For the 2002 Winter Olympics , the giant slalom was dropped in favour of the parallel giant slalom, an event that involves head-to-head racing. [ 5 ] In 2006 , a third event, the snowboard cross, was held for the first time. In this event, competitors race against each other down a course with jumps, beams and other obstacles. [ 6 ] Eleven athletes have won three medals: Americans Shaun White , Jamie Anderson , Lindsey Jacobellis and Kelly Clark , as well as Canadians Max Parrot and Mark McMorris , Japanese Ayumu Hirano , Austrian Benjamin Karl , Slovenian Žan Košir , New Zealander Zoi Sadowski-Synnott and Russian Vic Wild . Out of these athletes, only White has won three gold medals.
