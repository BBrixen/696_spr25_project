[ 1 ] In a change to previous qualification tournaments for this confederation, [ 2 ] the first three rounds were played as knockout rounds, with both the fourth round and the final round (referred to as the " Hexagonal ") played as group stages. The first round was played during the FIFA international dates of 23–31 March 2015. [ 3 ] CONCACAF announced the full format details on 12 January 2015. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The United States failed to qualify for the World Cup finals for the first time since 1986 after a surprise defeat by Trinidad and Tobago . As a result, Panama reached the World Cup for the first time in their history. Format [ edit ] The qualification structure was as follows: [ 4 ] [ 6 ] First round : 14 teams (lowest ranked teams were assigned spots 22–35) played home-and-away over two legs . The winners advanced to the second round. Second round : 20 teams (second lowest ranked teams were assigned spots 9–21 and seven first round winners) played home-and-away over two legs. The winners advanced to the third round. Third round : 12 teams (teams ranked 7–8 by CONCACAF and ten second round winners) played home-and-away over two legs. The winners advanced to the fourth round. Fourth round : 12 teams (teams ranked 1–6 by CONCACAF and six third round winners) were divided into three groups of four teams to play home-and-away round-robin matches. The top two of each group advanced to the fifth round. Fifth round : Six teams which had advanced from the fourth round played home-and-away round-robin matches in one group (often referred to as the "Hexagonal"). The top three qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup , and the fourth-placed team advanced to the inter-confederation play-offs . Entrants [ edit ] All 35 FIFA-affiliated national teams from CONCACAF entered qualification. [ 7 ] The seeding – used to draw the first four rounds of the qualifiers – was based on the FIFA World Rankings of August 2014 (shown in parentheses).
