I mean, everybody chooses flight. You know why? Billy Batson : So they can fly away from this conversation? Freddy Freeman : No, no, 'cause heroes fly. And who doesn't want people to think they're a hero, right? But invisibility, no way. That's pervy. Spying around on people who don't even know you're there. Sneaking around everywhere. It's a total villian power, right?
