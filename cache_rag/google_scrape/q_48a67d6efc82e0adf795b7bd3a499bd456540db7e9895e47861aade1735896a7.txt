Consequently, the Spanish release of the game used the English-language ROM, bundling the cartridge with a 150-page booklet containing all of the game's text in both English and Spanish. The cumbersome nature of the guide and the potential risk of encountering spoilers while flipping through it was considered enough of an issue that Spanish advertisements for The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask heavily emphasized the inclusion of a proper localization. Despite this, the guide's Spanish-language text was not added back in for the Virtual Console re-releases of Ocarina of Time . sell Advertisement/Commercial , Bonus Content , Corporate Affairs , Development , Early Idea , Regional Difference , Release Difference , Version Difference person VinchVolt calendar_month January 19, 2025 comment Comment (0) | Source arrow_right YouTube video by Censored Gaming: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_saTwX9mKc PDF of the text guide: https://inversethought.com/jordi/guia-de-textos-ocarina-of-time.pdf ▲ 3 ▼ The Goron Tunic, meant to protect Link from heat and reduce damage taken from lava, also affords the same protection against acid and spikes due to both being coded to use the same hit detection as lava. sell Development , Glitch person raidramon0 calendar_month July 29, 2024 comment Comment (0) | link Source subdirectory_arrow_right The Legend of Zelda (Franchise) ▲ 3 ▼ While Link being able to manually jump either on his own like in Zelda II: The Adventure of Link or through the use of an item like the Roc's Feather from The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening is a recurring ability in the series, several 3D installments forgo this in favor of having Link jump automatically at the edge of a platform. There are conflicting claims by series producer Eiji Aounuma and series co-creator Shigeru Miyamoto as to who thought of the automatic jump during the development of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and why. Aonuma claimed the autojump was directly inspired by the Roc's Feather and he had it implemented due to his own poor ability at playing platform games, wishing that the game could do the jumping for him. Miyamoto on the other hand claimed that he had thought of the autojump one morning and sprung it on the development team, who were planning to add a manual jump and were previously used to making Mario games, as an intentional limitation to see if they could "do all kinds of things." Manual jumping would be incorporated into a 3D Zelda game for the first time with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild . sell Controls , Development , General , Inspiration , Unsolved Mystery person CuriousUserX90 calendar_month June 13, 2024 comment Comment (1) | Source arrow_right Video talking about the origin of the autojump: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8fBeUkaqmM Iwata Asks interviews: https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/3ds/zelda-ocarina-of-time/1/1/ https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/3ds/zelda-ocarina-of-time/4/4/ Eiji Aounuma interview: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/nov/25/eiji-aonuma-legend-zelda-interview EDGE Issue #336 (Pages 32-35): https://www.pressreader.com/australia/edge/20190815/page/32 https://nintendoeverything.com/eiji-aonuma-discusses-how-zelda-links-awakening-influenced-ocarina-of-time/ Games which feature auto jumping talked about on Zelda Wiki: https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Autojump Games which feature auto jumping talked about on Zelda Dungeon: https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Auto-Jump subdirectory_arrow_right The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask (Game) ▲ 3 ▼ If the Song of Healing in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is reversed, it sounds similar to Saria's Song from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

According to Miyamoto, the Chain Chomps would be able to capture Link and wrap him up in chains, requiring him to use the Megaton Hammer to break them and free himself. Chain Chomps were present up until the final revisions of the game; Miyamoto did not explain why they were removed. sell Development , Early Idea , Reference person VinchVolt calendar_month December 17, 2023 comment Comment (0) | link Source ▲ 2 ▼ If the game detects that its cartridge is a pirated copy, Zelda's hair will turn into a giant pentagon in cutscenes, fishing will always result in a hooked fish escaping after 51 frames of animation, and Spoiler: the exit to Ganon's Castle during the escape sequence will be blocked off to Link, as Zelda will run right through the bars, leaving Link behind and making the game impossible to finish. sell Anti-Piracy , General person MehDeletingLater calendar_month September 21, 2021 comment Comment (0) | link Source ▲ 2 ▼ Much like how Bowser's laugh in Super Mario 64 is sped up for use as the Boo's laugh, Ganondorf's laughter is sped up to create the laughter of the Poe Sisters in the Forest Temple. sell General , Music , Voice Acting person mrnintendo622 calendar_month August 3, 2015 comment Comment (0) | link Source subdirectory_arrow_right Banjo-Kazooie (Game) ▲ 1 ▼ According to two interviews with Famitsu in 1998, Shigeru Miyamoto cited Rare's exceptional graphical and technical work on Banjo-Kazooie as a factor for why The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was delayed, as Miyamoto and his team felt they needed to compete with it. He thought a 3D action platformer of its kind running that well on Nintendo 64 hardware was "so amazing that we don't want to be outdone", and "if Mario's a makunouchi bento, Banjo's a deluxe makunouchi bento." Some reviews of Ocarina of Time at its release compared its graphics, frame rate and textures with Banjo-Kazooie's, and felt Ocarina of Time did not perform as well in that field. sell Development , Inspiration , Real Life , Release Date , Reviews , Sprite/Graphical Animation , Technology person Dinoman96 calendar_month October 23, 2024 comment Comment (0) | Source arrow_right Shigeru Miyamoto Famitsu interview - April 17, 1998: https://web.archive.org/web/20090129154359/http://miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/170498.shtml Shigeru Miyamoto Famitsu interview - May 8, 1998: https://x.com/m0m0_0ssrr_/status/1847144999642890416 https://x.com/gosokkyu/status/1847465155858477459 IGN 1998 review: https://web.archive.org/web/20121009233109/http://www.ign.com/articles/1998/11/26/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-review Electronic Gaming Monthly Issue #115 (February 1999) (Page 166 in the magazine): https://archive.org/details/electronicgamingmonthlyissue115february1999/page/n179/mode/2up ▲ 1 ▼ Sheik's Spoiler: true identity as Princess Zelda is hinted at during Sheik's Theme.

However, it can only be used to break this specific kind of bombable wall and this function is never actually mentioned in the game, suggesting that it may be a glitch. sell Glitch , Mistake person MehDeletingLater calendar_month February 29, 2024 comment Comment (0) | link Source ▲ 1 ▼ Inspired by medieval architecture, Shigeru Miyamoto traveled to Germany to use half-timbered homes in Lower Franconia as reference material and spent a few weeks in Northern Bavaria when creating Hyrule Castle Town. sell Development , General , Inspiration , Real Life person Twilight Sparkle calendar_month January 22, 2024 comment Comment (0) | link Source ▲ 1 ▼ While riding Epona, it's possible to jump over the Southern, Western, and Eastern fences to exit Lon Lon Ranch, with each jump featuring a unique cutscene. sell General person MehDeletingLater calendar_month September 26, 2022 comment Comment (0) | link Source ▲ 1 ▼ In a 1999 commentary with the game's composer Koji Kondo published in the GSLA archive, he stated that when "Ocarina" became the game's title, he decided to try and build the music around one central ocarina melody. Given that the ocarina only has five notes to play, he tried to write the various background themes in different genres (bolero, serenade, etc.) where each one would evoke a "catchy, memorable 3-note ocarina melody". This was the motif around which he created various simple, but distinct melodies, and was very careful to make sure he didn't repeat himself. Kondo then commented: "Game music is different from other genres in that it exists to make the game more enjoyable. In addition, there's a lot of interactive things you can do with game music, which I think is one of its defining traits. A very simple example would be the way the tempo increases when a time limit is running out." Kondo also stated the Hyrule Field theme is the main central song, and that he wrote it so that each time you play it, the song structure unfolds in a slightly different way. He also stated that when Link stands still for a while, the song will change to a more relaxed melody, and when enemies come close, the song will get tenser. Since it is a very long game, he tried to think of ways to keep the players from getting bored, and how to make the music evolve with what's happening on-screen. He hoped to continue pursuing this idea for interactive music in future games. sell Development , Early Idea , Easter Egg , General , Music , Real Life , Secret person ProtoSnake calendar_month June 29, 2022 comment Comment (0) | link Source ▲ 1 ▼ There is a lavafall in Dodongo's Cavern that can be jumped through to find a secret room that contains one recovery heart.

It may have been cancelled because it was planned to be released for the N64 Disc Drive, which was released late in the console's lifecycle and undersold in most markets. What was known, however, was that it would have added new features to the game, such as Link's footsteps appearing in sand, having damaged trees, having bushes and grass damaged for the entire game, and changing up dungeons. In 2012, a YouTuber named ZethN64 said he was going to try and recreate URA Zelda. He and his team wanted to make their own new dungeons, story, and soundtrack for the game. It was unfortunately cancelled, as there were conflicts within the team as well as ZethN64 disappearing. sell Cancelled Release , Development , Social Media person Arachnus calendar_month March 5, 2017 comment Comment (0) | link Source ▲ 1 ▼ Early during development, the Market was originally called "Downtown". sell Unused Content person Shiny Blazeikin calendar_month September 6, 2015 comment Comment (0) | link Source ▲ 1 ▼ During early stages of the game's development, the fence at Jabu Jabu's Belly near the entrance used to be a shortcut to the Zora's Domain entrance.
