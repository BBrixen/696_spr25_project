I just got my beta invite a few days ago and have played a couple of hours as a demon hunter.  Aside from a few annoyances the game is great so far and I can't wait till May 15th.  I've been thinking though.  Diablo 3 is a lot like Diablo 2 with obviously better graphics, sound, animation, etc.  Why did it take Blizzard 12 years to release Diablo 3?  It seems to me they could have released this years and years ago.  I've been searching around for an answer, but I haven't found a good one as of yet.  I thought I'd ask here and see if someone else could offer some suggestions. Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
