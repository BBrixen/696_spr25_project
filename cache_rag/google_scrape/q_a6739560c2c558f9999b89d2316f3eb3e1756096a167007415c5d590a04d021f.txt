Stab and twist. ― Dennis Graham instructs Silas Plaskett in how to use the kill stick on a walker. [src] ” A kill stick is a multi-pronged melee weapon created by the Civic Republic Military to put down walkers. On the blunt end is a retractable metal loop to capture walkers with. Contents 1 Post-Apocalypse 1.1 TV Series 1.2 World Beyond 1.3 The Ones Who Live 2 Killed Victims 3 Trivia Post-Apocalypse [ ] TV Series [ ] On the shores of Rat Island , Rick Grimes is armed with a kill stick and wearing an Alliance of the Three jacket. After a CRM helicopter finds him, Rick angrily stabs his kill stick into the head a walker buried in the mud and surrenders. World Beyond [ ] At Civic Republic Cull Facility 1 , Dennis Graham and his workers use kill sticks in conjunction with C4 to put down large numbers of walkers. If they come across any of the CRM's test subjects, they capture them with the kill stick's metal loop and transport them back to the research facility. After Silas Plaskett arrives at the facility, Dennis hands him a kill stick and has Silas use it to put down a surviving walker. After being trained in the facility's operations, a kill stick becomes Silas' preferred weapon, replacing the large wrench that Silas had used before working at the facility. At one point, Silas seems to consider using his kill stick against Huck in revenge for framing him for murder when they meet again. Silas carries his kill stick to the research facility when he and Elton lead a massive herd there to overrun the facility as part of the Endlings' plan. Silas is holding it when he is confronted at gunpoint by Webb , one of his former colleagues from the culling facility who is now a CRM cadet. While trying to destroy the chlorine gas with C4, Huck engages Jadis in battle using a kill stick. The two women fight to the death before Jadis kills Huck by stabbing her in the side with a small knife. However, the fight buys enough time for the makeshift timer that Huck had set on the C4 to count down most of the way, forcing Jadis and her men to flee. The Ones Who Live [ ] Rick Grimes and the other CRM consignees use kill sticks to clear a herd at the Harvest Point outside of the Civic Republic of Philadelphia . After Rick struggles and falls due to his missing hand, Lieutenant Colonel Donald Okafor grabs Rick's kill stick and finishes off the walker for him. Rejecting Okafor's attempts to recruit Rick for his program, Rick goes back to work and uses the kill stick to let out his aggression by taking out a number of walkers. After becoming a consignee, Michonne replaces her katana with a kill stick as she works at the Harvest Point killing walkers. While moving bodies, consignee Cleo Cliffton discovers two non-kills - walkers that survived the culling - who attack. Although the overseeing CRM soldiers move to dispatch them, Michonne impales one in the head with her kill stick, decapitates it, and flings the head into a walker that was coming up behind Cleo, smashing the second walker's head. The move impresses Cleo and the soldiers. Rick later returns Michonne's sword to her during Michonne's escape, but Michonne stashes her sword and returns to using a kill stick after deciding not to escape. After returning to work, Michonne lets out her anger and aggression on a herd, revealing her strength as Thorne points out and risking Michonne's cover as a " B ". After recruiting Michonne to their cause, Thorne has Rick outfit her with a provisional BDU uniform, but only allows Michonne as a kill stick as a weapon. Michonne expertly wields the kill stick against a large herd outside of the Cascadia Forward Operating Base , using both ends of the weapon to dispatch walkers alongside Rick, Thorne and the Frontliners . Michonne is disarmed of her kill stick before she leaves Cascadia Base, leaving her unarmed and forced to construct makeshift weapons in Greenwood . When Rick returns to Cascadia Base, he finds Major General Beale using a kill stick to personally dispatch walkers in the woods at the perimeter fence. Killed Victims [ ] Numerous counts of zombies Trivia [ ] This is referred to as the CRM Trident in The Walking Dead: No Man's Land . However, Dennis Graham and Pearl Thorne call it a kill stick in " Foothold " and " Bye " respectively. It's also referred to as a kill stick in the closed captioning for The Ones Who Live describing the weapon's use. v • d • e Melee Weapons Blades Axe • Balisong • Bayonet • Bec de Corbin • Bush Axe • Fire Axe • Halberd • Hatchet • Kama • Katana • Knife • Kukri • Machete • Meat Cleaver • Pickaxe • Pizza Rocker • Push Dagger • Rock Pick • Saw • Scythe • Sickle • Sword Sharp Weapons Awl • Bear Trap • Boat Hook • Cane • Fire Poker • Hay Hook • Kill Stick • Lawn Edge • Morning Stars • Pitchfork • Pool Cue • Road Spikes • S-Pole • Screwdriver • Spear • Spike Strip Blunt Weapons Baseball Bat • Baton • Brass Knickles • Car Club • Crowbar • Digging Bar • Fire Extinguisher • Golf Club • Hammer • Long Handle Weeder • Monkey Wrench • Rebar • Shovel • Sledgehammer • Staff • Tire Iron • Wrench Prosthetics Aaron's Arm • Agent 46's Arm • Alicia's Arm • Amy's Arm • Davon's Leg • Hank's Hand • Hershel's Leg • Jeff's Leg • Merle's Arm • Rick's Hand • Kenny Signature Weapons Abraham's Tomahawk Axe • Alicia's Sharpened Barrel Shroud • Axel's Iron Mace • Axel's Shield • Beta's Knife • Beale's Sword • Brody's Hammer • Carol's Knife • Chairles • Clementine's Fire Axe • Clementine's Hatchet • Dakota's Knife • Daniel's Folding Straight Razor • Daryl's Knives • Daryl's Morning Star • David's Pipe Knife • Elijah's Kamas • Elton's Axe • Elton's Fisherman • Emile's Battle Axe • Ezekiel's Sword • Henry's Staff • Iris' Brambled Mace • Isabelle's Morning Stars • Javier's Baseball Bat • Javier's Hammer • Jeremiah's Crucifix • Jerry's Battle Axe • Jesus' Sword • Jiang's Spear • Josiah's Shovel • Judith's Katana • Laura's Chain Weight • Lee's Fire Axe • Lee's Hatchet • Lee's Meat Cleaver • Losang's Staff • Madison's Hammer • Magna's Warhmmaer • Matthew's Knife • Mercer's Axes • Michonne's Katana • Morgan's Shield • Morgan's Staff • Nick's Spear • Rick's Hatchet • Rosita's Macuahitl • Siddiq's Saw • Silas' Wrench • Strand's Sword • Tara's Sword • Tyreese's Hammer • Violet's Meat Cleaver • Wangfa's Sword • Hilda • Lucille • Mandy • Shiloh • Soul Cleaver • Valofax Miscellaneous Weapons Amper Serum • Cattle Prod • Compactor • Salt Lick • Shield • Street Sign • Whip Categories Categories : Weapons Melee Weapons World Beyond Civic Republic of Philadelphia The Endlings Civic Republic Military New York TV Series Television Universe The Ones Who Live No Man's Land Community content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.
