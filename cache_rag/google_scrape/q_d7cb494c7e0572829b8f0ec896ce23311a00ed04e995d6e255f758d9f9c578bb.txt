Matches take place on one of two maps that rotate every two hours. [6] During multiplayer matches, pressing the X button displays the map, which assigns each of the other three players and the home base to one of the buttons on the D-pad, allowing the player to Super Jump to that location by pressing A. [4] Splatoon 2 also supports motion aiming like in the first game, regardless of the controller being used. [4] The game features a new multiplayer mode titled Salmon Run, in which a team of four players must last as long as possible against endless waves of enemies.

Scanning the amiibo allows players to save their weapons, clothing, and gameplay settings to the amiibo; the player can also take pictures with their amiibo, and the amiibo may occasionally give the player clothing items.
