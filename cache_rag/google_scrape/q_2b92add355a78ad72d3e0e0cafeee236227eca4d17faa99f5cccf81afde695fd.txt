U.S. athletes have competed in every Summer Olympic Games in the modern era, except the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which was boycotted by the American team and 65 other countries in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . The USOC sent a total of 588 athletes to Beijing (310 men and 286 women), and competed in all Olympic sports except handball . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The USOC selected San Jose State University in San Jose, California , as the primary processing center for all Team USA members headed for Beijing 2008. [ 4 ] They flew into San Jose via San Jose International Airport or San Francisco International Airport for at least two days of document checks, health examinations, cultural briefings, portrait sittings, uniform fittings, and last-minute workout sessions. [ 5 ] The U.S. did not win the most gold medals for the first time in a Summer Games since 1992 , with China being the country that won the most golds (48–36).  The United States never led the medal table during the games. [ 6 ] However, the U.S. won its most medals ever (112) in a games not held on home soil, had the highest total medal count, and won more silver and bronze medals than any other participating nation. [ 7 ] This games also saw a gold medal record for U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps , who won 8 golds surpassing Mark Spitz 's record of 7 golds in a single Olympic event in 1972 . [ 8 ] Phelps also surpassed Spitz, Larisa Latynina of the USSR , Paavo Nurmi of Finland, and U.S. sprinter Carl Lewis to become the current record holder for the most Olympic gold medals (14). [ 9 ] The United States also saw milestones in women's swimming. Natalie Coughlin won 6 medals in Beijing, the most for a female Olympic swimmer. [ 10 ] Dara Torres , who won 3 silver medals after her eight-year absence, became the oldest Olympic swimmer to win a medal, at age 41. [ 11 ] Gymnast Nastia Liukin became the third U.S. female to win a gold medal in individual all-around event . [ 12 ] It was also a successful Olympics for U.S. team-based sports, as men's and women's basketball teams both won gold, as did men's volleyball, men and women's beach volleyball, women's soccer, women's eight in rowing, and the men's and women's 4 × 400 meter-relay teams. [ 13 ] The US won silver and bronze medals in several other team events; women's volleyball, softball, baseball, both men's and women's team gymnastics, men's fencing sabre team, women's fencing foil team, and both men's and women's water polo.

[ 23 ] This marked the return of the United States national baseball team to the Olympics after not qualifying in 2004; the United States had appeared in all three of the official baseball tournaments, and nearly all of the exhibition and demonstration events, before then. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The American team sought its second gold medal in the sport, but finished winning the bronze. [ 24 ] Baseball was open only to male amateurs in 1992 and 1996. As a result, the Americans and other nations where professional baseball is developed relied on collegiate players, while Cubans used their most experienced veterans, who technically were considered amateurs as they nominally held other jobs, but in fact trained full-time. In 2000, pros were admitted, but the MLB refused to release its players in 2000, 2004, and 2008, and the situation changed only a little: the Cubans still used their best players, while the Americans started using minor leaguers. The IOC cited the absence of the best players as the main reason for baseball being dropped from the Olympic program.

[ 82 ] On the second allocation, both Sam Sacksen and Dennis Bowsher were offered bids by the UIPM. [ 83 ] Since one man was already on the squad, only one other slot was available. The U.S. used World Cup rankings to determine who would be on the squad and who would be named alternate. Bowsher appealed the decision but his claim was denied. [ 84 ] On the men's team, U.S. Olympic Training Center residents Eli Bremer and Sam Sacksen both made their Olympic modern pentathlon debuts. They struggled early, with disappointing scores in shooting (10 m air pistol) and fencing (épée one touch). [ 85 ] For the women's team, 16-year-old Margaux Isaksen joined Sheila Taormina, the first woman to appear in the Olympics in three different sports. Like the men, Isaksen and Toarmina started off slowly, failing to rank higher than 24th in either shooting or fencing. Taormina, however, finished strongly, taking first place in riding (show jumping) and setting a modern pentathlon Olympic record in swimming (200 m freestyle).

The initial team included seven competitors and two alternates.

[ 132 ] The third slot never materialized, and the United States was not placed on the start list for the +105 event. [ 133 ] The best U.S. hope for a weightlifting medal was expected to be Melanie Roach , who set a new American record and finished in sixth place.
