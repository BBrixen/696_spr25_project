Members Online • Painting0125 Why Dexter Fletcher is a better pick for director on the next Fantastic Beasts movies Having seen Rocketman, his visual style has a magical and kinetic energy in terms of narrative and pacing, the musical numbers' for example shows that flare: from intense, flashy choreography, use of color palettes, VFX and practical effects blend well and compliment each other just look at 'Saturday Night's Alright' sequence, and he doesn't put a lot of shots and emphasize the scenery and movements. Also, the dramatic moments in the film takes you to emotion, his way of directing actors allow them to feel the scene,  you can feel every word in line delivered. You can see that Dexter Fletcher didn't only made an Elton John biopic but a human being resonating a lot of themes like love and acceptance. Fletcher directing a Fantastic Beasts movie reinvent the franchise, the same way Taiki Waititi for Thor: Ragnarok. His take in a wizarding world film that magically feels its own world and at the same time, personal. Just imagine a Dumbledore vs Grindelwald duel in Dexter's hands.
