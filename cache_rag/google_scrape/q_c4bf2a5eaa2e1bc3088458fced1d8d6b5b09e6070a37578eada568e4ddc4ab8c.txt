The actress beat out Isabelle Huppert ( Elle ), Ruth Negga ( Loving ), Natalie Portman ( Jackie ), and Meryl Streep ( Florence Foster Jenkins ) for the honor. Stone began her acceptance speech by first naming all of her fellow nominees, saying, “To the women in this category, you are all extraordinary, and I admire you. It has been the greatest honor to stand by you.” “A moment like this is a huge confluence of luck and opportunity,” she said before thanking director Damien Chazelle for giving her a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” Stone also gave co-star Ryan Gosling a shout-out at the podium, “Thank you for making me laugh and for always raising the bar.” A visibly shaken Stone ended her speech by telling the audience, “I still have a lot of growing and learning and work to do, and this [award] is a really beautiful symbol to continue on that journey, and I’m so grateful for that.” Stone has received critical acclaim for her role as an aspiring actress struggling to land her big break who falls in love with a jazz musician (Ryan Gosling) in Los Angeles in the romance musical. The first-time winner was nominated for best supporting actress for her role in Birdman at last year’s Oscars ceremony. Leading up to the show, Stone racked up three best actress wins for La La Land at the SAG Awards, BAFTA Awards and Golden Globes. La La Land ended the night with a total of six wins for best actress, directing, production design, cinematography, original score and original song. The 89th annual Academy Awards, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, took place at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on Sunday.
