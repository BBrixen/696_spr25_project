London (Great Britain) and Paris (France) were also given consideration as hosts, but Athina was elected by acclamation. 1900 Summer Olympics Paris was selected to host the 1900 Olympic Games at the Sorbonne Congress in Paris on 24 June 1894, after Athina had been selected to host the 1896 Olympic Games. 1904 Summer Olympics The host city for the 1904 Olympic Games was selected at the IOC Session in Paris on 22 May 1901. The original selection was Chicago, Illinois, the only serious bid. Three other American cities, Buffalo, New York, New York City and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania had also been considered. But, eventually, Chicago stepped aside to allow St. Louis, Missouri to host the 1904 Olympic Games. This was confirmed by a postal vote of the IOC who responded in December 1902. The vote was 14 – 2 in favor of St. Louis. 1908 Summer Olympics The 1908 Olympic Games were awarded to Roma (Italy) at the 6th IOC Session in London on 22 June 1904. The other candidates had been Berlin (Germany) and Torino (Italy). At the 8th IOC Session during the 1906 Intercalated Olympic Games in Athina, Count Eugenio Brunetta d’Usseaux , advised the IOC members that because of the erruption of Mount Vesuvius, Roma no longer had the financial resources to host the 1908 Olympics. But in reality, the decision had been taken sometime before the volcanic eruption. Baron de Coubertin then turned to London (Great Britain). On 19 November 1906, the British Olympic Council sent a letter agreeing to host the 1908 Olympic Games. 1912 Summer Olympics Stockholm was selected by acclamation at the 11th IOC Session in Berlin on 28 May 1909. Berlin (Germany) was quite interested in hosting the 1912 Olympic Games but withdrew its bid shortly before the session. 1916 Summer Olympics Berlin (Germany) was selected by acclamation at the 15th IOC Session in Stockholm on 4 July 1912. After withdrawing its bid for the 1912 Olympic Games, in favor of Stockholm, a gentlemen’s agreement had been in place which virtually promised the 1916 Olympic Games to Berlin. Al-Iskanderiya (Alexandria) (Egypt) and Budapest (Hungary) made the only serious competing bids, but both withdrew prior to the IOC Session. Amsterdam (Netherlands), Bruxelles (Belgium) and Cleveland, Ohio (United States) withdrew their bids earlier on. 1920 Summer Olympics Antwerpen (Belgium) had been promised the 1920 Olympic Games at the 17th IOC Session in Paris in 1914. But because of the ravages of World War I, which devastated Belgium, Lyon (France) made the most serious offer to step in as hosts for the Games of the VIIth Olympiad. Lyon and Amsterdam (Netherlands) formally bid for the 1920 Olympics but withdrew prior to the 18th IOC Session in Lausanne at which Antwerpen was confirmed as the host city on 5 April 1919. Other cities  made overtures but never made an official bid: Atlanta, Georgia (United States), Budapest, (Hungary), Cleveland, Ohio (United States), La Habana (Havana) (Cuba) and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (United States). 1924 Summer Olympics At the 20th IOC Session in Lausanne on 2 June 1921, Baron Pierre de Coubertin requested that the IOC formally vote for Paris (France), to host the 1924 Olympic Games and Amsterdam (Netherlands), to host the 1928 Olympic Games. This request was based on his intended retirement as IOC President shortly after the 1924 Olympic Games. The IOC voted on this matter with 14 votes for the proposal, 4 against the proposal, and 4 abstentions. Four other cities had been bidding for the 1924 Games: Barcelona (Spain), Los Angeles, California (United States), Praha (Czechoslovakia) and Roma (Italy). 1928 Summer Olympics Amsterdam (Netherlands) was chosen as the host city at the 20th IOC Session in Lausanne on 2 June 1921, in the dual vote with Paris for 1924 (see The Games of the VIIIth Olympiad ). The only other city considered was Los Angeles, California (United States). Amsterdam had been virtually promised the 1928 Olympics when it stepped aside in favor of Paris for the 1924 Olympic Games as a favor to Baron Pierre de Coubertin , founder of the IOC, who was retiring as IOC President after the 1924 Olympics and wished to have them held in his native France. 1932 Summer Olympics Los Angeles, California (United States) was awarded the Games of the Xth Olympiad by acclamation at the 22nd IOC Session in Roma on 8 April 1923. There were no other serious candidate cities. 1936 Summer Olympics By 1930, no less than 14 cities had shown interest in hosting the 1936 Summer Olympics: Berlin (Germany), Barcelona (Spain), Alexandria (Egypt), Budapest (Hungary), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Dublin (Ireland), Köln (Cologne) (Germany), Dublin (Ireland), Frankfurt am Main (Germany), Helsinki (Finland), Lausanne (Switzerland), Nürnberg (Germany), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), and Roma (Italy). By the time the 30th IOC Session in Barcelona was scheduled, all but two bids were withdrawn: Barcelona itself and Berlin. Because only 19 voting members were present at the IOC Session, a postal vote was held, which Berlin won 43 - 16. 1940 Summer Olympics Various cities were interested Al-Iskanderiya (Alexandria) (Egypt), Athina (Greece), Barcelona (Spain), Budapest (Hungary), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Dublin (Ireland), Helsinki (Finland), Lausanne (Switzerland), London (England), Montréal (Canada), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Roma (Italy), Tokyo (Japan) and Toronto (Canada), but only two bids remained at the bid voting at the 35th IOC Session in Berlin on 31 July 1936. Round 1 Tokyo Japan 36 Helsinki Finland 27 Tokyo withdrew as hosts of the Games of the XIIth Olympiad on 16 July 1938. The 1940 Olympic Games were awarded to Helsinki on 3 September 1938 at a meeting of the IOC Executive Board in Bruxelles, Belgium. After the outbreak of World War II and the Soviet invasion of Finland, Helsinki eventually also withdrew, on 23 April 1940. 1944 Summer Olympics Bid voting at the 39th IOC Session in London on 9 June 1939. No exact date has ever been published for London relinquishing the 1944 Olympic Games but the war in Europe obviously made it impossible to hold such an event, especially in London. Round 1 London Great Britain 20 Roma Italy 11 Detroit, Michigan United States 2 Lausanne Switzerland 1 At an earlier stage, Budapest (Hungary), Helsinki (Finland) and Montréal (Canada) had also shown interest. 1948 Summer Olympics Because of time constraints, and the difficulty getting IOC members to travel to a central location for voting on the 1948 Olympic Games, London (Great Britain) was confirmed as the host city by a postal vote. The vote was confirmed at the 40th IOC Session in Lausanne on 4 September 1946. The other candidates were: Baltimore, Maryland, Los Angeles, California, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (all United States) and Lausanne (Switzerland). 1952 Summer Olympics Bid voting at the 41st IOC Session in Stockholm on 21 June 1947: Round 1 Round 2 Helsinki Finland 14 15 Los Angeles, California United States 4 5 Minneapolis, Minnesota United States 4 5 Amsterdam Netherlands 3 3 Detroit, Michigan United States 2 – Chicago, Illinois United States 1 – Philadelphia, Pennsylvania United States 0 – Athina (Greece), Lausanne (Switzerland) and Stockholm (Sweden) had entered preliminary bids. 1956 Summer Olympics Bid voting at the 44th IOC Session in Roma on 28 April 1949.
