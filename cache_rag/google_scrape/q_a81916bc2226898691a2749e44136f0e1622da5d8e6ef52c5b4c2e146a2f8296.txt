However, the Rams and Chargers announced construction delays have pushed the opening of the venue from 2019 to 2020. That time frame would've meant putting the Super Bowl in a stadium that isn't even a year old. According to the Orange County Register 's Rich Hammond , NFL rules stipulate a stadium must be open for two full regular seasons to be considered for Super Bowl hosting duties. Opting for Tampa as a replacement host in 2021 makes sense. The city bid for the Super Bowl in 2020, losing out to Miami Gardens, Florida. Tampa is also familiar with the infrastructure needs of a Super Bowl, having hosted the event in 1984, 1991, 2001 and 2009. 03:20 Palmer's NFL Draft Takeawaysüìù TOP NEWS Post-Draft NFL Power Rankings Bleacher Report 13h NFL Draft Picks We Wanted to See üëÄ Bleacher Report 13h Ranking Top 10 Free Agents Post-Draft Bleacher Report 13h Way-Too-Early 2026 Mock Draft Bleacher Report 1d Browns Didn't Rank Shedeur High Bleacher Report 10h TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 11h Shedeur Sanders Reportedly Was Top QB on Giants' Board After Cam Ward Ahead of Draft Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 3d 4 NFL Teams That Will Regret Passing on Shedeur Sanders the Most Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 4h 2025 NFL Draft Sets Day 3 Record with 4.3M Average Viewers amid Shedeur Sanders Slide Day 3 sets record w/ 4.3M average viewers across all networks, channels Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 3d Undrafted NFL Free Agents 2025 and Latest Details on the Biggest Signings Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 5h Cris Carter Estimates Shedeur Sanders 'Threw Away' $30M-50M Amid NFL Draft Rumors TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 11h Shedeur Sanders Reportedly Was Top QB on Giants' Board After Cam Ward Ahead of Draft Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 3d 4 NFL Teams That Will Regret Passing on Shedeur Sanders the Most Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 4h 2025 NFL Draft Sets Day 3 Record with 4.3M Average Viewers amid Shedeur Sanders Slide Day 3 sets record w/ 4.3M average viewers across all networks, channels Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 3d Undrafted NFL Free Agents 2025 and Latest Details on the Biggest Signings Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 5h Cris Carter Estimates Shedeur Sanders 'Threw Away' $30M-50M Amid NFL Draft Rumors Bleacher Report About Advertise Contact Us Get Help Careers Sitemap Community Guidelines Privacy Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information Terms Of Use AdChoices B/R Sports on MAX B/R Creators Program Copyright ¬© 2025 Bleacher Report, Inc.
