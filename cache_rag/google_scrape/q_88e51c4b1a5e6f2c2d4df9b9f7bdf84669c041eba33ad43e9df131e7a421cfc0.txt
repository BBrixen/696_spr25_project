Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's Leaked Stanford Talk | Hacker News Hacker News new | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's Leaked Stanford Talk ( github.com/ociubotaru ) 392 points by gregzeng95 8 months ago | hide | past | favorite | 485 comments Ozzie_osman 8 months ago | next [–] His explanation for Google losing to OpenAI on GenAI: "Google decided that work life balance and going home early and working from home was more important than winning." What a tremendous lack of self-awareness. Let's put aside all the leadership issues, all the politics, all the complacency, all the bureaucracy, and blame people for working from home. (Not saying there aren't folks at Google who are just cruising, etc... but that's a fraction of the problem compared to the leadership issues) pzo 8 months ago | parent | next [–] Considering that in Meta I heard (from friends) it is/was easier to work remotely and even easier to get into (they are less leetcode oriented) I would expect the problem with Google loosing is somewhere else. Google was loosing on many fronts for a while: - dart lost to typescript on web - angular lost to react - tensorflow looks like currently loosing to pytorch - seems like google got bored and more development is for JAX, Keras wrapper [0] - IMHO flutter will loose with react-native or kotlin compose multiplatform - compare github insights for details Meta on the other hand kickstarted open source Llama community. In this situation it's hard to bet on Gemmini or Gemma as 3rd party developer considering google projects kill records. The only project they were really to bet on and invest for the long run without getting tired early on was Chrome and Android. [0] https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=... chii 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] > Google was loosing on many fronts i believe this trend is a result of management culture and performance metrics that attempt to measure "impact", and correlate pay and promotions along those measures. It's the same reason why google products die when they don't reach mega-success (thus products getting killed off in spades recently). Nobody wants to be doing maintenance on projects started by somebody else - so as soon as the lead visionary leaves for better pastures, that project gets languished, and whoever takes over it cannot use it to generate promotion worthy impact. jordanb 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] I'd go further and bet that those "impact" metrics likely came from a spreadsheet pusher like Schmidt. Schmidt still takes the gold medal in my estimate for destroying a company he ran by not understanding how the business actually works (as CEO of Novell he decided to screw their channel partners not understanding that the channel relationships were the company's entire moat against Microsoft). nradov 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Channel relationships were a boat anchor around Novell's neck. The channel helped Novell grow rapidly in the early days then building a file server and installing an office network took some real technical skill. But then Microsoft released Windows NT and a new generation of hardware came out which allowed any idiot to set up a LAN. Microsoft beat Novell in part by distributing their server software more widely instead of forcing customers to go through channel partners. Of course, it also didn't help that Novell failed to innovate on their products and tried to coast on past success. jordanb 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Network installers are still used to this day on big network buildouts, simply because office IT departments aren't staffed for that kind of work regardless of how easy the software is. But it's not like Schmidt had any strategy to bypass the network installers. He just decided to screw them hard so he could make a quarter look good, which lead inevitably to them deciding not to be Novell's low-paid salesforce anymore, which lead rapidly to the vastly premature collapse of the business. specialist 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Microsoft stood-up a channel in order to compete with Novell. Initially, at least, Microsoft was much a preferable OEM. Better docs (MSDN), better tech support, more profitable, etc. (Microsoft also made embraced application servers. Spearheading switch from workgroup to client/server. But that's another chapter.) threatofrain 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I felt like I could rationalize a lot of Google decisions to kill products, such as Inbox or Reader, but retiring Google Domains really shook my confidence in GCP. noname120 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Absolutely staggering. Google Domains complemented GCP perfectly and would make thanks to Cloud DNS a stellar seamless end-to-end integration. I'm in disbelief as to why they removed this crucial feature while at the same time going full in with GCP. I could understand deprecating Google Domains for B2C, but for B2B?! What went through their heads? moogly 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Because they couldn't shoehorn "AI" into the product, I guess. lazide 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] No, some of the folks involved in the decision (literally) previously worked for GoDaddy. Even dumber. exac 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It is actually insane that they did this. I literally stopped recommending people use GCP over this - you can't get started easily because you have to use another platform for the domain. Why even use GCP at all? freeqaz 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] It was also incredibly sticky with GSuite. Setting up security and everything was a breeze -- DMARC email records, SMTP, etc all magic -- I truly couldn't believe when this was announced. It was incredibly sad and I still feel upset about it a year later. Porkbun is my go to registrar now. And I switched my email to Migadu. red-iron-pine 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] also at porkbun for dns, big fan. saying this as someone who used to work for enom, if that matters. candiddevmike 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Google Cloud Domains is still a thing, and you can purchase domains from the console still.  The registrar changed to square space, but it didn't really impact Google Cloud's usage. aeternum 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Even a worse decision then because they're still supporting UI around it. Did it really come down to some PM not wanting to do registrar paperwork? campers 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Agreed, such a critical piece of infrastructure, the mind boggles. I'll have to see what I can pry out of our Google account team about it. krisgenre 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Even though I was a Google fanboy, this was a nail in the head. Had a .dev domain which expired and squarespace asked like 6 times more to let me buy it back. Waited till the grace period was over and bought it back for the original price from NameCheap. mFixman 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > I believe this trend is a result of management culture and performance metrics that attempt to measure "impact", and correlate pay and promotions along those measures. Meta's performance reviews are also heavily weighted for measurable impact. I think that the reason why it's beating Alphabet in so many fronts is team culture. Most new product teams are small and have a reasonably flat hierarchy. It's easy to make impact that's both effective and measurable, and the amount of engineering time working in "useless work" is minimised. bitcharmer 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yup, Google MBA'd itself into the ground. Iulioh 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yeah, i don't want to invest in anything google, i'm scared it will be uselss in 6mo. That's a big problem, a "support guarantee" could really help things. Google is now a AD platform with a search engine to sell stuff. I hoped a little bit in Fuchsia, it was the last one for me. Rinzler89 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] >Google is now a AD platform with a search engine to sell stuff. NOW?! They were that for the past 20 years mate. cynicalsecurity 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Their search isn't even so great any more. They tend to forcefully switch the user input to some generic terms. More than often duckduckgo produces better results for me. I started feeling comfortable using duckduckgo instead of google. dartos 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] I’m not sure you understand how ingrained and far reaching Google ad manager is. Their search could die and they’d still be the biggest advertising player on the internet by leaps and bounds. Jensson 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Facebook would be bigger. dartos 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Not. Even. Close. Jensson 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] You are just ignorant, Google search is 57% of their total revenue, remaining advertisement is just 19%, people really overestimate how much Google ad network is worth when its just 9.2% of their revenue and YouTube is just 10%. In fact if you remove search Google makes more money from selling subscriptions and services than they do from ads, so they would no longer be an ad company! https://www.voronoiapp.com/business/Breaking-down-Googles-Q1... Facebook makes much more money than 19% of Google. Edit: And I wonder why I got downvoted for being right, many here just blindly believe that Google gets their money from ads on third party sites when most of it comes from search. But I guess your second post is right, it isn't close, Facebook would be much bigger. Iulioh 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Exactly how does Google makes money through search if not...advertising? Jensson 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Dartos said they were bigger without search: > Their search could die and they’d still be the biggest advertising player dartos 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] I said they’d still be the biggest player in the advertising space. Nothing about their worth or whatever. Google ad manager is the cornerstone of pretty much all internet advertising. Even if you don’t buy ads from Google directly, somewhere in your ad pipeline is google ad manager. Jensson 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] > Google ad manager is the cornerstone of pretty much all internet advertising. That money is a part of Googles revenue, so there isn't as much there as you might think. Maybe you mean there is quantity there but advertisers doesn't pay as much for it as they would for Facebook or Google search ads, then yeah that is possible, but normally in a market segment you count big players by revenue and not numbers sold. dartos 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] You’re just not really understanding what I’m saying. Iulioh 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yeah but the search engine provided a service good enough that you could overlook that I noticed today that they get rid of filters in the "products/shopping" tab FFS tgma 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Fuchsia is part of the problem not the solution. It was the retirement home to keep a bunch of smart people busy who didn't have any rush to ship anything real for as long as possible. Architecture astronaut porn to the max. On the other hand there's zero desire at Google to try and build the best phone. They have conceded that to Apple a long time ago. No desire to be number one in Cloud. They are fighting for number 3 spot. They are the Xerox of AI with a full stack solution. If they had the drive they would be HYPING THE SHIT out of TPU and making it the best solution to run all the real workloads people have. Guess what. On average a Googler even still today with low bar to entry is probably 10 IQ points higher than average Amazon or Microsoft or Apple. But no; no drive. kmerroll 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] I hadn't heard the term "architecture astronaut porn" before. Seems highly accurate in this context and wondered if you could point me to other resources on this term? tgma 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] "Architecture Astronaut" is an old term IIRC coined by Joel Spolsky https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architect... porn is added by yours truly. raminf 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Firebase (especially Cloud Messaging) is in use by a lot of companies. Killing that off will have a huge blast radius. etc-hosts 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Firebase is going away? superidiot1932 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Fuchsia isn't dead. Yet. meindnoch 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Fuchsia is a talent retention project. Basically daycare for kernel engineers, to prevent them from leaving Google. lupusreal 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] But what do Google shareholders get out of this? throwaway173738 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] They get to keep those engineers out of the hands of competitors. intexpress 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It is dead david38 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Meta is also heavily involved in “impact” metrics spi 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I know nothing about what makes an industry succeed or fail, and also nothing about web tech, but working in the field I can comment on: > tensorflow looks like currently loosing to pytorch - seems like google got bored and more development is for JAX, Keras wrapper Well, TensorFlow doesn't "look like currently losing", it has already lost since a long time. I haven't seen a decent paper release code in TensorFlow in years, and all the references I see to TF online are job posts from "older" companies (to the point that, if you are looking for a job in data science, seeing TF mentioned in the job post is kind of a red flag of a place you don't want to be). That said, I am quite certain that this has only a small impact on why Google is losing terrain, and even on why it is behind in AI (which is also debatable: narrative aside, Gemini is not that much lacking behind competitors). Certainly if TensorFlow + TPUs turned out to be better than PyTorch + GPUs they would have had a lead to start from, but if that was so important, Meta or NVIDIA would have created the first LLM, not OpenAI. Simply, sometimes stuff happens, you can't predict it all. nvarsj 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Considering that in Meta I heard (from friends) it is/was easier to work remotely and even easier to get into (they are less leetcode oriented) This is a weird take. It might pertain to 2020 during Covid when Meta encouraged remote working, but it's not like that anymore. Interviews were always leetcode focused so nothing changed there. Meta is an interesting comparison because the performance culture has historically been way tougher than Google (sans Covid years). It's quite a shock for a lot of Xooglers who join. One Xoogler at Meta who told me they only used to work 4-6 hours a day at Google. That is basically impossible in Meta - you have to constantly prove your value and the perf bar is high. I think Google is changing now though and I wouldn't be surprised at all to see them adopt Meta/Amazon style perf cultures in the future. Source: I work at Meta, and have close friends at Google. theGnuMe 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] The grind catches up to you.  Your body keeps the score, don't let them fool you. All these asshole managers like Schmidt. nvarsj 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] I agree it takes a toll - but you get well compensated for it. theGnuMe 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Not really in the grand scheme of things. lazide 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Compared to at least as bad, or even worse ‘toll’, for dramatically less pay in literally every other industry and 95% of every other companies in this one? Bwaha. Have you ever worked in another industry? Retail? Healthcare? Trades? Public safety? Tech is a walk in the park, relatively speaking. theGnuMe 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] The tech job never ends.. the others have defined limits and are shift work. lazide 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Healthcare? Public safety? Most construction work? All of them have the same thing going on. Hell, healthcare has even formalized it in some cases into 24+ hr shifts for residents. In all these industries, there are areas where it isn’t a thing, and areas where it is absolutely a thing. But they do (often) get paid overtime. Not residents though. eclectic29 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Meta is less leetcode oriented? I'm shocked to read this. Meta is the poster child for leetcode style interviews. Meta requires you to solve 2 leetcode style questions in 35 mins (out of 45 mins - first 5 mins for initial pleasantries, last 5 mins for asking questions). For each question, you're required to (based on the signals they look for) ask clarifying questions, present a solution to the interviewer, get buy-in, code, verify with test cases - all this in 17.5 mins/question. Go figure! :-) websap 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Meta is the most leetcode heavy interviews for SWEs, they expect you to solve 2 leet code questions in every coding round. fer 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Unsure Meta now, but FB was indeed absurdly leetcodish 10 years back. mk67 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Same when I interviewed ~1-2 years ago. letitgo12345 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Tensorflow losing has nothing to do with Google getting bored -- it's vice versa. Tensorflow is a symbolic framework, which is less intuitive to work with for most people than the Pytorch. Not to mention the errors Tensorflow generates are more annoying to debug (again more an issue with the fact that it's symbolic than any lack of effort on part of Google) Google tried to fix it by introducing an eager mode in Tensorflow but by then it was too late. michaelt 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] > Google tried to fix it by introducing an eager mode in Tensorflow but by then it was too late. And the fix was "new major version with a fundamentally different programming paradigm" But it turns out when your users are irritated with your product, and you tell them to change to a fundamentally different programming paradigm, the new programming paradigm they change to might not be yours. janalsncm 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Intuitive has nothing to do with it. Developers will tend to prefer things that make their lives easier. Debuggability is a huge part of that. Tf 1.0 having a static execution graph was a major pain. No wonder people switched to PyTorch and didn’t look back. ubercore 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] All of those examples (except maybe tensorflow, I don't know enough to say for sure) are interesting because they highlight a more "googly" approach to the problems. Typescript is a superset of javascript, Dart isn't (though it transpiles). Flutter implements its own widgets, react native controls native widgets. yeukhon 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Dart, angular don't matter in business. They are just "passionate" projects. Google's culture of having multiple teams trying to build and scrape and never commit to a product is a big problem. They aren't slow to adopt to trends but they always seem to "overthink" about products. So when they lose the edge they close the door on the product. In the case of Google Meet, Good Lord, they renamed at least six times before they finally settled. make3 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] the tensorflow and jax thing is 100% over, everyone uses pytorch both in academia and the industry, at least in the western world etc-hosts 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I recently did interviews with Meta, Google, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia... Meta leetcoded the ** out of me.  They were insisting on 3 days in office.  Definitely the hardest interviews out of the bunch.  Never got around to answering Netflix recruiter to get the tradition "N" in FAANG out of the way, I took the first offer I got, I was so tired of interviewing. logicchains 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] >dart lost to typescript on web >angular lost to react >tensorflow looks like currently loosing to pytorch - seems like google got bored and more development is for JAX, Keras wrapper Google seems to have a deep-seated distrust for programming language theory, as well as a deep-seated distrust for its users. This combination produces awkward software and APIs that ignore modern PLT and take a "Google knows best" approach. throwaway123468 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] As someone who's been working with them a lot at the moment I'm going to say that the problems that google has are not anything to do with tensorflow or programming language theory and everything to do with the fact that the place is absolutely jam-packed with MBAs and other ex-McKinsey-type professional meeting attendees.  This is really apparent if you are reasonably senior in an enterprise and deal with google as a vendor. Every meeting I attend with them has one or two engineers[1] struggling to breathe because there are at least 6 or 7 sales people, relationship managers or other non-doing non-technical middle-management spreadsheet jockeys stealing all the oxygen in the room.[2] I can only imagine how terrible it is to work there given that these folks have all the power internally. I've genuinely never dealt with an organization that seems this bad. [1] who are usually pretty good. [2] It's an internal joke at my enterprise how every meeting another new person from google shows up introduces themselves as head of some other microscopic facet of the corporate relationship. throw___away 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] As someone two years into working at Google this resonates hard and has absolutely been my experience as an engineer there too. It's certainly not the culture I was expecting for sure. throwaway9155 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Longer-time Googler here. We went blindingly fast from "A few engineers decide to use the most powerful computing cluster in the world to make a meme generator because it would be a cool project" to "Let's have a sync meeting with 15 people, including five managers, to discuss buying a $20,000 test instrument, which will need to be approved by four directors, three of whom are OOO for the next two months." thanksgiving 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Something changed recently though because yes there are those MBA types but the engineer in the room used to be not a sales type person. Now (earlier this year, just before IO), even the engineers are becoming more like salespeople in my experience. My guess is there is pressure for everyone to make more money somehow? red-iron-pine 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] this is the end result of all publicly traded companies.  eventually you'll hit Sears-level of selling where the CEO just straight up puts departments in conflict with each other until the whole thing just falls apart. redwood 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If I had to guess you're probably an Enterprise customer of Google cloud? I'm not sure that's a representative take.. of course there's going to be a lot of sales and relationship manager types because you're a customer of their Enterprise offering.. internally Google's completely different tgma 8 months ago | parent | prev | next [–] I think the reporting of his quote overemphasizes on "work from home" piece of his sentence as that fits right into a continuous obsession/bike sheds. Whether "work from home" is the cause or not, I think he is absolutely right on the latter part of his sentence, that contrary to startups, almost no individual at Google has the fire or drive in them to play to win . If you are young and you go work at Google, they will beat that fire out of you very quickly. "Work" from home is just one way that nobody-cares attitude is manifesting itself. [BTW, that attitude is by no means exclusive to ICs; definitely leadership has it as well, perhaps more so.] BossingAround 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] > almost no individual at Google has the fire or drive in them to play to win Yes, that's why you go to large megacorps. I wouldn't go to Oracle, IBM, Google, Facebook, MS, etc. etc. if I had a "huge fire or a drive to win". Honestly, I go there because I wanna work 5 hours a day (less if possible) and have a stable career. If I want to work 9-12h a day, give me an upside. None of these huge megacorps will reward that. If I'm the lead of a Goog project that becomes a hit, do I get $10M bonus? Of course not. I get a pat on the back and something to put in my packet for the next promotion interview. So you're absolutely right, but the problem is not in people. It's in the way the system's designed. fooker 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] >  do I get $10M bonus? Seems like you might want to consider the finance industry. If you make something important 5% faster, you bet you are getting a few years worth of salary as bonus. RyanHamilton 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] I think you would have to target the scope even smalller to particular areas of finance probably quant or trading within a hedge fund. The majority of jobs at a large bank are mostly fixed salary with limited bonus. There are many jobs that are essential but don't capture a percentage of  the value they generate. For example processing transactions is essential for a bank but typically doesn't pay large bonuses in that area. fooker 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Large banks can pay very well for the right software role, but there's so much more nepotism than big tech that it's pretty much impossible to land these unless you have a godfather in the industry AND you are a recognized prodigy. skyyler 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] >There are many jobs that are essential but don't capture a percentage of the value they generate. Isn't that strange? RyanHamilton 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Unfortunately not.  Nurses, doctors, bin men, car mechanics, plumbers can all be essential at times but rarely pay large bonuses. fooker 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] It's the scale. One important blue collar worker can help a limited number of people at a time, usually one. One line of code can affect what billions of people are doing. roncesvalles 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The incentives in finance are remarkably well-tuned to rewarding employee effort. Make the company 300k? You get 30k. Make the company 300 million? You get 30 million. meiraleal 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] That seems so easy to game. Do some small change that brings short term gain, bag the profit and let the rebound be the failure of another team. arethuza 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Doesn't that pretty much describe the 2007-2008 financial crisis? 1over137 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] And every such crisis before it, and the next one too. throwaway7ahgb 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The crisis was 07/08, but the buildup was almost a decade in the making, does that count as short term? blibble 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] the law in the UK is that material risk takers bonus pay over a certain amount (couple of hundred thousand) is deferred over 3-5 years and can be clawed back throwaway7ahgb 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If you think it's easy to game 30M in short term revenue, please try to do that in a large firm.

If the advertised salaries are real, they're very well-paid (300-700k USD, plus bonus). fooker 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The path of least resistance is to become a well known C++ or systems guru. This can be done by contributing substantially to the language standard, a compiler, etc etc. Or you could learn COBOL! throwaway7ahgb 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] First step, understand what Finance means in the scope of technology work. c0mbonat0r 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] i dont have a clue runeblaze 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This is oversimplifying too much IMO. Obviously the potential reward working at startups is much higher than megacorps, and you can very safely say that people working at startups have a higher risk appetite. However, plenty of people work 9h-12h a day (say, at Meta) in wish to get promoted at rocket-speed and play to "win" the higher TC at megacorps, and it happens often enough that very-driven people do join megacorps. whatshisface 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] A lot of people at a megacorp play to win, they've just realized that the company's value is so much higher than the value they could add to it, that for them, winning means capturing part of the company's value for themselves. In a sense the company becomes the market and their friends become the company. kamaal 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] >>but the problem is not in people. It's in the way the system's designed. System was designed by the people, more specifically people with ability to make decisions a.k.a management There might not have been one person making all the wrong decisions. But more like lots of small wrong decisions, but it doesn't reduce the fact that it is management that is always responsible for the state of affairs. bradlys 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Yes, that's why you go to large megacorps. I wouldn't go to Oracle, IBM, Google, Facebook, MS, etc. etc. if I had a "huge fire or a drive to win". Honestly, I go there because I wanna work 5 hours a day (less if possible) and have a stable career. I agree that many want the stable and low hours career but how many people at these big companies are getting that? I mostly see it as a FOB farm and trying to overwork the overwhelming majority of workers at these companies. For all the stories of people working five hours a day and making $400k/yr - I hear many more working 60 hour weeks. > If I want to work 9-12h a day, give me an upside. None of these huge megacorps will reward that. I don’t really see startups rewarding that much either. Maybe it’s more rewarding if you’re a founder. I’m speaking as someone who has been an early engineer at startups and gone public with them.  I still don’t see them as that rewarding unless you’re a founder. Also, incentives aren’t the same. You might make a great thing but unless you’re near the top - you’re probably not going to get properly rewarded regardless of how good your ideas and whatnot are. People at the top will steal credit because that’s what they do. (“Look at how good I am at hiring/managing/inspiring/etc.”) ryandrake 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] > For all the stories of people working five hours a day and making $400k/yr - I hear many more working 60 hour weeks. This is absolutely right. For every senior person in a glamorous role at a FAANG making $400k/yr, there are probably five less senior, less glamorous people making $150k/yr, grinding away trying to justify a promotion to the next level. The people posting to HN that their brother's girlfriend's nephew's roommate makes $400k think that's every FAANG developer. bradlys 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] To be more balanced on this, I don't think that many are making <=$150k/yr if they're in NYC/Seattle/SF and are in engineering. I think many are making $300-400k/yr but have a high workload. Levels gives a clear direction that if you work at big tech as an engineer, you'll usually make decent to good income. Whether it's worth the WLB/PIPing/misery is what you have to figure out. There's a reason a ton of the people at FAANG are all on H1B. It's not a lack of domestic talent - it's a lack of Americans willing to be worked that hard and go through insane hoops to get said jobs. (justifiably so btw) I think a large reason why most of the crowd at FAANG is way more autistic than average is because autists can put up with such insane working conditions/hoops.

I don't agree, but there are challenges at Google that don't exist in other large companies. Google's monorepo along with the 'bottom up' driven culture means that to enact any non trivial change, you need many sign-offs, which means an iron clad design doc, and either you have to be brave enough to make huge disparate changes across other teams codebasse, OR to wait multiple quarters to have respective teams execute. Sometimes this is awesome, and it means you can do really complex things over the course of a year.

The bigger the corp, the slower, duller and more rigid it becomes _unless_ someone at the CxO level actively fights against it in a opinionated manner (which still doesn't often register well with boards and major shareholders).

I am not so sure it's that cut and dry. Even among the FANG, the desire to play to win is vastly different. I'd say Apple still has that mojo. Facebook also more than Google although that ship went south post-2018, I'd say. Tesla comparatively underpaid and overworked people but I think they play to win. SpaceX even more so. Folks who work hard there are excited to do so because they feel their work matters . There are non-monetary structural features of large corporations that make them different on that metric. I think the desire at the top to want to win in the first place is critical, plus the autonomy at the lower level to ship cool ideas without much roadblock or dilution of contribution among way too many people. anal_reactor 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think what's hilarious to observe is the transition from "the dream nerd company" to yet another tech hedge fund. js8 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] How can you have "drive to win" if you are just an employee of a company, and have no stake in it?

Another 1987 study of worker cooperatives in Italy, the UK, and France found "positive" relationships with productivity. It also found that worker cooperatives do not become less productive as they get larger. A 1995 study of worker cooperatives in the timber industry in Washington, USA found that "co-ops are more efficient than the principal conventional firms by between 6 and 14 percent". janalsncm 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] I wonder why there aren’t more worker co-ops then.

People with capital like to retain control over their capital, so they don’t start cooperatives. Coops don’t have the same incentive structure as external-investor-beholden corporations, so they don’t pursue “growth at all costs”, but rather survival at all costs (job preservation), and then growth where appropriate (pie expansion). It’s kind of like the trade off between authoritarian regimes and democratic regimes.

They are by far our best bet at solving large coordination problems through price signals. Even though they are far from perfect. I do believe that free markets require capitalism (i.e. profits go to the owner of the capital rather than those who do the labour). But nothing there is against strong regulation, collective bargaining, and anti-trust. Nor is there anything about companies being soley beholden to their shareholders. Also, 'free' markets can only exist with a whole bunch of regulation, and even then some markets (e.g. emergency care) can never be free. datavirtue 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Socialism, or anarchy.

Stating that anytime that happens and one person happens to be a CEO instantly makes that person a sexual predator is not based in any kind of reality. A CEO that abuses their power or engages in any kind of non-consensual relationship is a different story. I agree it’s generally a bad idea , because of perception, favoritism, the power imbalance, and a dozen other reasons. But it being a bad idea doesn’t necessarily imply that the CEO is a sexual predator, either. Sometimes even people in power care about consent. And sometimes people in power are predators. That happens too. Maybe even more often; I don’t have stats. I’m not defending Schmidt. I have no idea about him or his sexual proclivities, nor do I know the details about any of his personal relationships. Neither do you. He may be a monster!

Not only are people choosing the WFH job over the in office job given the same salary and benefits, but they'll likely choose a less-paying WFH job. Your in-office job pay needs to overcome both the convenience and getting-people-to-change-jobs taxes now. Otherwise you are getting people desperate for a job or that aren't skilled enough to land a WFH job. So it's simple: you ask for more, you pay more. We know Schmidt's comment "Google decided that work life balance and going home early and working from home was more important than winning." is just trying to get more out of workers for no additional pay. Convincing people to work harder with words only costs time. But companies aren't doing that. They're going the opposite direction and making return to office a threatening and oppressive response. Then they are also turning around and doing layoffs on top of it. Those who are good can go find a WFH job. None of what the CEOs are doing coincide with what they are saying, and no one trusts them.

Lots of very clever people (who just don't know how to or want to learn to code) will be picking up the skills to use AI as it gets better and better.

The Trojan Horse wasn’t so disastrous because it was filled with way more soldiers. It was because they had penetrated all of the defenses and had the element of surprise. Iran just sent I-don’t-know-how-many drones and missiles at Israel like a few months ago. A few of them landed, but most were caught and intercepted in the air. Here’s the thing: if even one of them had hit, say, the center of Tel Aviv, or the old city in Jerusalem, it would have been a massively successful attack, even if none of the other ones had done any damage. The size of zero armies was measured in that exchange. latexr 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] The Trojan Horse is a myth. It’s as meaningful an example of military strategy as Gundam robots.

I get that china is a direct economic threat. That’s obvious. I also get that china is a philosophical threat on a level different to the Soviet Union (that was freedom produces more wealth than totalitarianism - which the US won.). The problem with China is that the argument is much harder to win - china is doing well economically (kinda) - and has not given up its totalitarian control.  Their argument was the Soviet Union tried central command economics whereas we are something something power of markets and chinese culture. What gets me is that this is not something to win on the battlefield - this is something where we (being liberal democracies) need to double down on liberal democracy- both the production of wealth and the use of that wealth to raise the living standards of all its citizens - in other words if we think freedom is better we make it so fucking obvious we live in utopia it’s painful.

Not (just) having bigger guns. gkanai 8 months ago | parent | next [–] As someone who spent 5 years in China pre-pandemic, China is a threat to many nations due to their growth. The Chinese govt. is specifically targeting key markets (EVs, solar, battery tech, steel, semiconductors) and China makes much more of those items that can be used internally in China. So China ends up driving any non-Chinese battery or solar panel manufacturer out of business. If Chinese EVs were to be sold widely in the US, they would be less than half the cost of any Western-made EV and would take over the EV market. A future where Chinese companies own the EV market in the US with all of the  American user data going back to servers in China- that's just not a future the US govt. wants- no govt. (outside of China's own) should want that. Then there's the whole Fentanyl epidemic in the US and elsewhere. That is largely due to Chinese chemical manufacturers who are selling the chemicals to Mexico and then those drugs are smuggled into the US. There are many to blame here but the US has been pushing China to ban the sale of these chemicals outside of China for a long time without agreement. China realizes this is important to the US and it's being used as a key trade issue. "doubling down on liberal democracy" got us to where we are now wrt China. China doesn't respond to liberal democracy. They only respond to force or trade embargos, or tariffs.

What's wrong with the alternative where we allow real competition that benefits everyone, and then ban any features (eg sending data to servers) that the government gets nervous about? I don't see how this is any different from the myriad of other requirements on cars (eg mandated safety belts etc etc etc). I recognize that state-subsidised competition still isn't fair, so I support import tariffs that match those subsidies, but any further and you're just hurting competition and the consumer, right? Thing is, super cheap EVs and solar panels is exactly what we should want . There's a climate crisis going on and these things are a big part of the solution.

China have found the loopholes, their lack of IP (intellectual property rights) enforcement and government corporate espionage have shown the relationship is asymmetric and to the detriment of the US. Xi has also strengthened his hold on power dramatically, breaking with his predecessors gradual loosening of control.

Not sure I'd argue that it's great for living standards though. so yes, let's compare GDP for what it measures, money number divided by people number, and see that our number is bigger, yay. But simplifying that to living standards is lazy shortcut thinking. If a FAANG engineer makes $400k/yr, but minimum wage is $15/hr or $30,000, their average pay is $215k, which sounds pretty great! The living standards for two someones making $215k are much nicer than for the one person making $30k. How much do you trust your neighbors? How about those city/rural/suburb folk, especially the ones the extremists on the opposite side of the political spectrum? That contribute to a good living standard?

Obviously it has not the same economic weight in the West as it used to, but that is true for all former colonies. Look, I agree that it would be better if China was a liberal democracy (although I also believe that liberal democracy has only limited effect on limiting imperialism, as is obvious from the British and US example). But if the Taiwanese people will be forced to choose between economic depression (due to some more sanctions on trade with China) or losing democracy, I sure hope, for the sake of their future, they will choose the latter.

If you say that isn't "aggression", that is what people say about other separatist movements, separatists are always labeled aggressive and combative, somehow people always argue that separatists are never happy and always wants more, but evidence suggests that letting them separate actually can work and make both sides happy. So I am pretty sure that sometimes when two countries wants to unify you should let them, meaning "rewarding aggression" is sometimes the right play. For example, if England instead of waging a war against Irish separatists let them separate I think both would be happier, but instead of doing like Sweden they punished the aggression and just caused misery for everyone. Now about China you are possibly right, I just think you can't say that you shouldn't reward aggression in general, because often that is exactly what you should do. kqr2 8 months ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Likewise with Crimea and Russia.

In my opinion, it's not about communist vs democracy, IP theft, ideology, Taiwan, etc. Elites hardly care. These are just the topics used by the government to get common people riled up. The sentiment comes from increasing competition from China in the upper value chain where these elites get their wealth from. These elites want China to manufacture phones for them. They don't want China to design phones and sell it to consumers directly. The same sentiment was found when Japan looked like it was going to take over the world economically. It's a lot easier for the government to get its citizens to become anti-China if they use anti-communist, IP theft, human rights, etc. propaganda. Commoners resonate with these much easier.

He definitely wants Trump in office because he knows if Chinese EVs ever make it to American shores, Tesla would have fierce competition. Trump wanting massive tariffs on Chinese goods matters little to Elon. Elon doesn’t care if he has to pay $5 for a Chinese good at Walmart instead of $2.50. Only commoners will suffer. But as long as Elon gets extremely high tariffs on Chinese EVs, he’ll be happy. For Schmidt, it’s clear that he has big ownership stakes in American tech companies.

To make matters worse it aims to seize hegemony over east Asia and to dominate the Western Pacific. This directly implicates the United States as currently most of the non-PRC states in that region are either treaty allies of the USA (Japan, Australia, South Korea) or significant economic powers that provide many crucially important goods to the US (Taiwan, Vietnam). Furthermore, the PRC is embarking on a naval expansion only rivaled in history by the buildup of the German High Seas Fleet in the 1900s. This combines both a grand strategic objective (regional hegemony) with large-scale active efforts to acquire the tools to achieve that objective. Finally, the last piece of the puzzle; The US and other western powers have not faced any major war since 1945 because of atomic weaponry. However, the atomic posture and grand strategic situation between the USA and the PRC is far different from that along the Iron Curtain during the Cold War. Both the US and China have nukes yes, but both only have strategic weapons, and those would likely only be used in a situation where the existence of the state was under threat. A war for dominance of the western pacific and east asian hegemony would not be an existential war for either power. This paradoxically makes a hot war far more likely than it was in West Germany, where tactical nuclear weapons were written into the battle plans from Day 1. Combine that with a Chinese state facing a "Now or Never" moment to attempt to achieve their grand strategic objectives as their demographic crisis approaches and the US rearms after 25 years of the unipolar moment, and the late 2020s and early 2030s are looking extremely dangerous. American elites are not stupid and understand this full well and this is why, in the past decade, anti-PRC sentiment has become universal across party lines. Ideology plays a relatively small role in this (beyond of course the fact that the PRC ideology has made them a revisionist power). aubanel 8 months ago | parent | prev | next [–] Maybe it's an occurrence of Thucydides trap: the reigning power is afraid to lose its crown, and as a result becomes more and more aggressive towards the growing power.

Then, each enemy of every new entry to the nuke club also feels pressure to get nukes. Next, everyone gets in a race to build more nukes. Additionally, you get the same issue as with Russia. If a big power takes a smaller power, then where do they stop? What is to stop them from taking everything. And this is already happening. China has been in low level clashes with the Philippines to take forcefully reshape borders. If they do this to Taiwan and the Philippines, then they likely will do this to every country in a border dispute with China. And Taiwan is strategically important.

That's a common misconception. The war against communism was fought and won with violence. Sometimes this violence was meted out directly by the US (in the case of Vietnam (about 0.5 million civilian casualties), North Korea (1 million), Cambodia (150k)), and in a lot of cases by local militias armed and trained by the US (Indonesia 0.5M dead, the Chile coup leading to Pinochet being in power). The forceful intervention of the US in foreign countries whenever they tried to be even slightly leftist is well documented. Heck, we even armed and trained Bin Laden in the fight against communism! Maybe within the US itself it was fought with liberal democratic means (although, McCarthyism is a thing), most of the world by population had to be convinced violently. That isn't to say that all communists were all nice and peaceful like the ones in Chile and Indonesia; Pol Pot and Stalin need no introduction. But to say we won the war with words and ideas dismisses the suffering and pain of millions as non-existent.

Having a better economic system relative to communism, diplomacy with China to part ways from USSR - these seem more important. That great violence unleashed in various wars wasn't actually necessary for  realizing the goals of the countries involved is a very important history lesson which can prevent future violence.

Also, the USSR did similar acts (Hungary, Afghanistan) but could not win. That the US prevailed owes a lot to its economic dynamism relative to USSR.

I'm not claiming the US was violent for violence's sake. They were calculated actions with the intent of smothering any left leaning movement in the third world. Specifically the Indonesian case is egregious because their communist party was about as left wing as Bernie Sanders, and still a US-backed genocide was carried out against (suspected) leftists in Indonesia. Similar with the case in Chile. This was a democratically elected center left president, and the US-backed coup installed a violent dictatorship for the next 15 years. keiferski 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] No problem; and yes I think the best way to look at the Cold War is via the game theory approach of two powers battling each other.

This is nonsense, there are plenty of very leftist countries that USA didn't attack, so that provably wasn't the reason. Communism is first and foremost anti democratic and authoritarian in these countries, that is the main issue. If you take Sweden that was very close to going towards worker owned economy in the 80's USA didn't do anything to them, same with rest of Europe. Sweden since then became much more right wing and moved away from those ideas, but at the time it looked very likely. ah27182 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] The point the parent comment made still stands, why did the US fund so many coups/regime changes up until the modern day? Your answer as to why seems to be “communism is antidemocratic and authoritarian”. If that’s the case, why were so many Western backed regimes also antidemocratic and authoritarian? keiferski 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] American interventionism in the Cold War largely got started under Eisenhower. His administration’s policy could be best described as a reaction against Soviet moves (or perceived Soviet moves) in the countries affected. And so by engaging in regime change, the rationale was that this prevented that state from aligning with the Soviets. This seems to have worked in many cases but not in others, but I won’t get into the historical details here. The point is that lot of people seem to forget that the USSR wasn’t sitting at home, either, and was deliberately funding political actions around the world as a part of the Cold War. Whether that “justifies” US interventionism is a different question, but people seem to talk about it as if the US was acting in a vacuum. ah27182 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] > people seem to talk about it as if the US was acting in a vacuum The Cold War ended more than 30 years ago, yet the same “interventionism” continues? This is isn’t ancient history, we fought two whole imperial wars since the with the same exact thought process without the USSR even existing anymore. I don’t deny that there was some kind of context to American imperialism and I have no interest in whitewashing what the Soviets were doing. But to say that these “interventions” were a purely defensive/reactionary measure against communism is silly, the US has a vested interest in protecting its hegemony control. It’s that simple. keiferski 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] I don’t think I’d categorize Iraq and Afghanistan as “imperial wars” and as remotely similar things as the regime change operations during the Cold War. Very different context and reasoning. But sure, powerful states want to protect their hegemony. Part of that includes not letting your allies turn into hostile enemy states. I’m not sure what else you’re suggesting such a power do? Let the oppositional force just take everything? The opinion you’ve expressed here is just the typical cynical approach that seems to lack any understanding of real world politics, or the basic fact that people in the Western “free” world might actually have a legitimate interest in promoting freedom and defending their values. I recommend reading biographies of presidents during that era, especially Eisenhower. You’ll learn about the difficult (and often wrong) choices those in power had to make. To treat their actions as simply some kind of imperial bloodlust is not even remotely historically accurate. Again, I am in no way arguing that these various interventions were “good” or “justified” or what have you, just that the framing of them as purely militaristic imperial conquests is flat out wrong and uninformed. ah27182 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] I’m firm on my claim that they were imperial wars, but we can lay that to the side. > I’m not sure what else you’re suggesting such a power do? Let the oppositional force just take everything? This is precisely my problem. If the US/West wants to maintain a moral high ground by claiming that their “freedom” and values are simply the best and everyone needs them, then why is there an incessant need to subjugate? There is no moral high ground with continuously destabilizing countries and making half the world’s life a living hell. I’m happy to talk about the actual realities of geopolitics. Of course the US wants to maintain control, but that desire is a not a “moral” one. keiferski 8 months ago | root | parent | next [–] Saying that the US has put “half of the world’s life a living hell” is really hyperbolic and not at all conducive to a real discussion, because again, that’s not how history actually happened. To give you an example: the Korean War officially started when communist-backed North Korea invaded the Western-backed South. Had the South not been backed by the US, they would have lost - and indeed almost did lose. Are you therefore suggesting that if the entire Korean Peninsula were under the control of the North today, they’d be better off? Because the reality is that South Korea today is more free and economically successful because the US intervened there. Or what about Germany? If the US let the Soviets take the entire country, do you think Germany today would be the economic leader of Europe? Of course, there are situations in which that defense turned out in the opposite way - Vietnam for example. As to your last comment, again, this is just the typical cynical line that assumes everyone in the government is an evil imperialist that only pretends to care about their values. You are ignoring the very basic fact that many of these interventions were done in order to prevent the very anti-free USSR from defeating the West. It wasn’t a foregone conclusion that communism would be defeated, or atomic war avoided. And so the people in power in the West needed to make very difficult decisions about navigating this game theory situation.

Schmidt is entitled to his opinion, though it's been a long time since he's been personally involved in personally getting things done.  He's also been hanging out with his friend Elon and absorbing that narrative into his brain. Also, it's difficult to comment what WFH looks like "on average".  In my career I've learned the brutal reality of what "average" really means and looks like.  Spoiler alert: Average human behavior is often surprisingly lr even shockingly lower than I anticipated. Yet, Google, and the Bay Area and other tech hubs are full of at least slightly to moderately above average people, due to the natural competition to even survive and be successful in these areas.

Cheers and keep doing your thing. brailsafe 8 months ago | parent | prev | next [–] I didn't read the mention of work from home as all that important of an example in making his point, and ironically I interpreted it in an entirely neutral light. He could have instead said that Google decided it was more important to let people have lives outside of work instead of winning, and I'd interpret it the same way, because only an idiot sacrifices too much for their employer. He's not saying it's a bad thing in general, he's saying that if the company's goal is to win, it needs to crack the whip on people who are highly intelligent, but too stupid, too arrogant, and have no other concept of life outside their screens and bank accounts that they'll do literally whatever is demanded of them. You should be proud to be able to raise a kid _at_all_, but even prouder of the fact that you're only willing to give your company marginally more than you need to in order to make it work. If you needed to work harder I'm sure you would, but you shouldn't be volunteering to do double extra overtime so sociopaths from the valley can flex on other sociopaths from South Africa.

Gigachad 8 months ago | prev | next [–] In the talk, Eric suggests that very soon you could use AI to automatically generate TikTok clones and publish them repeatedly to the App Store until one of them takes off. Even if we assume this is possible soon, is there any way that this doesn’t result in the App Store immediately devolving in to auto generated slop and all users leaving the platform or just ignoring it. In what scenario does an app that was generated automatically in seconds result in you becoming the next mega tech company raking in huge profits. typewithrhythm 8 months ago | parent | next [–] Anything dependent on "user generated content" has a capture factor.  It doesn't matter if all the apps are slop, people will follow established creators, and new creators will follow an established audience. I suspect the clones of something existing have no real chance of success without some sort of external marketing hook; better revenue sharing or similar. The rest will be ignored like every other current low effort app. whywhywhywhy 8 months ago | parent | prev | next [–] > is there any way that this doesn’t result in the App Store immediately devolving in to auto generated slop and all users leaving the platform or just ignoring it.
