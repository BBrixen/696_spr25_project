October 7 : Trouble With Harry This Isn't You Set Things Right It's All Connected Finally Free October 8 : Together [ 24 ] Notes [ ] ↑ There is a continuity error regarding May's age. In Aunt May's bio page, she is listed as 66 years old. However, her tombstone places her year of birth as 1953, which would make her 65 at the oldest. ↑ Felicia's exact age is unknown. Dialogue between Aunt May and Peter indicates that Felicia is older (but "not that much older") than Peter, who was born roughly in 1995. Her father faked his death during her childhood around 1999, placing her date of birth in either the late 1980s or early 1990s ↑ According to Hardy, the original Black Cat operated twenty years prior to the events of The Heist . As the Heist takes place circa Febuaruy 2019, this places Hardy's time as the Black Cat at roughly 1999. ↑ In real life, mayoral elections in New York are run every four years, with a maximum of two consecutive terms per mayor (although a mayor may run for a third term after the next election). Assuming the election system functions the same in-universe (excluding the different year for election cycles), Norman would become mayor of New York in 2015.

Inside Peter Parker's house there is an October calendar right as you enter, there are no days crossed off during the entirety of the game, so the game most likely begins on October 1st. Many times on both The Danikast and Just the Facts with JJJ, the events of the game are referred to as "the last week" meaning the game's events happen over approximately a week. Which fits perfectly with the passage of time presented in each mission. Categories Categories : Marvel's Spider-Man series Community content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.
