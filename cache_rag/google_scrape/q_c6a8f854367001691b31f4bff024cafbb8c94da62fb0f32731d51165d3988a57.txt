Subreddit icon by u/Kellie975 Members Online • RxAlbatross I think Splatoon 3 content and updates are incredible Discussion Just think about it. You pay one time for this game (around 40-50 bucks depending on your currency) day one and you have been getting nonstop updates. There is no battle pass, no microtransactions, no premium currency. Nintendo has released an outstanding set of new features, modes, weapons, stages, MUSIC, oh my god. There are games out there that, while they are free to play, they are paywalling literally everything: characters, skins, even weapons, and they dont come even close to the staggering amount of things to do. This month in splatoon 3 we had splatfest, several challenges, eggstra work, and also the new stage, decavitator, wellstring, you might want to push to X battle, try to get badges on ranked, try to reach a new record in salmon run... is just, I mean, ridiculous that you can get all of this from a game released 2 years ago. And if you want to get additional single player, the DLC is like stacked of things to do and unlock. I can't say everything is perfect in Splatoon 3 but man, this has been a ride I won't forget.
