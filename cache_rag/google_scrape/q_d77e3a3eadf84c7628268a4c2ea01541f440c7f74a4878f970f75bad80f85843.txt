Written by Jason Cipriani, Contributing Writer Oct. 19, 2021 at 2:08 p.m. PT Image: Google Google just finished its Pixel Fall Launch event where the company announced its latest pair of smartphones, the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro . The new phones come with Android 12 out of the box, use Google's new Tensor processor and have several camera upgrades. Google's Rick Osterloh, SVP of devices and services, was joined by other executives who walked viewers of the event through Google Tensor, Pixel 6 and the features users can expect. Here's everything Google announced on Tuesday. Android 12 is live Image: Google Google didn't announce it during the event, but instead used a blog post to announce that Android 12 is officially out and available for Pixel owners. Google's Android hardware partners will release the update on their own schedule, ranging anywhere from a few days after Google's official release to several months or longer. The update includes several new improvements including one of the biggest interface redesigns come to Android since its launch. In addition to a new look that changes based on your wallpaper, Android 12 has new privacy features. You can now see when an app has accessed your camera or microphone, as well as see a dashboard of all your private information and how often it's accessed by specific apps. If you have a Pixel phone, you can download the update right now. If you have a phone from a different company, like Samsung, you'll need to wait until your phone's maker has the update ready.

Pricing for the Pixel 6 is $599 , while the Pixel 6 Pro starts at $899 .
