Norway’s dominance was apparent from the beginning of the Olympic Games, with 14 gold medal wins in sports like cross-country skiing and more medals from other skiing events from jumping to downhill. Germany came in second with 31 total medals and 14 gold medals, and Canada finished in third with 29 medals, 11 of which were gold. After a number of historic wins for the United States late in the Games, Team USA finished fourth with 23 total medals, including nine golds. The 2018 Olympic Games came with a number of surprises and spills, including everything from record-breaking performances to gold-medal favorites failing to make the podium. The United States was an example of both: Figure skaters Nathan Chen and Mirai Nagasu made history with their performances on the ice, but failed to make it on the individual podium. (They did, however, both take home a bronze medal with the rest of their team.) While Mikaela Shiffrin earned one gold and one silver medal, she fell short of the podium in her signature slalom event and pulled out of the downhill event while at the Olympic Games. Surprises late in the Olympics helped boost Team USA’s medal count after a lackluster start. The U.S. women’s ice hockey team beat Canada for gold for the first time in 20 years at the Games, and the men’s curling team won after making it to the country’s first-ever gold medal match in the event. And snowboarders like Chloe Kim, Jamie Anderson , Shaun White and Red Gerard dominated the sport’s podium with gold-medal wins. Still, the U.S.’s performance in PyeongChang fell behind its second-place finish in Sochi. In 2014, Russia earned 29 medals for the win, edging out the U.S., which earned 28. Back then, Norway had the third-highest medal count with 26. Here’s the final medal count for each country at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Norway: 39 medals 14 gold, 14 silver, 11 bronze Germany: 31 medals 14 gold, 10, silver, 7 bronze Canada: 29 medals 11 gold, 8 silver, 10 bronze United States: 23 medals 9 gold, 8 silver, 6 bronze Netherlands: 20 medals 8 gold, 6 silver, 6 bronze South Korea: 17 medals 5 gold, 8 silver, 4 bronze Olympic Athletes from Russia: 17 medals 2 gold, 6 silver, 9 bronze Switzerland: 15 medals 5 gold, 6 silver, 4 bronze France: 15 medals 5 gold, 4 silver, 6 bronze Sweden: 14 medals 7 gold, 6 silver, 1 bronze Austria: 14 medals 5 gold, 3 silver, 6 bronze Japan: 13 medals 4 gold, 5 silver, 4 bronze Italy: 10 medals 3 gold, 2 silver, 5 bronze China: 9 medals 1 gold, 6 silver, 2 bronze Czech Republic: 7 medals 2 gold, 2 silver, 3 bronze Finland: 6 medals 1 gold, 1 silver, 4 bronze Great Britain: 5 medals 1 gold, 4 bronze Belarus: 3 medals 2 gold, 1 silver Slovakia: 3 medals 1 gold, 2 silver Australia: 3 medals 2 silver, 1 bronze Poland: 2 medals 1 gold, 1 bronze Slovenia: 2 medals 1 silver, 1 bronze Spain: 2 medals 2 bronze New Zealand: 2 medals 2 bronze Hungary: 1 medal 1 gold Ukraine: 1 medal 1 gold Belgium: 1 medal 1 silver Kazakhstan: 1 medal 1 bronze Latvia: 1 medal 1 bronze Liechtenstein: 1 medal 1 bronze Correction : The original version of this story misstated the medals won by Italy. The country won 2 silver medals and 5 bronze, not 5 silver medals and 4 bronze.
