Subreddit icon by u/Kellie975 Members Online • Grablycan New Salmon Run game modes ideas Discussion Some days regular SR can be boring, so I came up with some new modes that could be real fun if made. I have 2 ideas atm Basket carrier. One of your fellow coworkers carries around the egg Basket and you have to deliver the eggs to them. If they die, it equips itself to another player. You don't have access to your regular weapon when you have the Basket, but in return, the Basket is also an inkzooka that becomes more powerful the more eggs you deliver to it. I'd compare it most to Rainmaker feel wise, but Salmon Run-ified. Boss Salmonid possession. You get to play as a Boss Salmonid and terrorize those pesky Grizzco employees trying to take your eggs and make sure they don't make quota. Relieve Splatoon 2 as a Stinger, sneak up on people as a maws, aim Big Shot's egg cannon, etc. So obviously the Salmons get a huge power boost in this mode, so in return, the employees get Grizzco weapons and better stats overall as a way to balance it out. This is a mode i know is one that will need it's own set of balance changes separate from the base game to make it work, but when it works, oh i feel it'll be fun. Read more New to Reddit?
