She and Steffi Graf are the only two players in the Open Era to win 4 consecutive Grand Slam singles titles on 2 separate occasions. First player, male or female, to complete a Career Golden Slam after turning 30 years of age (WIM 2012, OLY 2012, USO 2012, FO 2013, AO 2015). (matched by Novak Djokovic WIM 2018, USO 2018, AO 2019, FO 2021, OLY 2024) Third female player to win 70+ matches at 3 of the 4 Grand Slam events. She had AO 70 match wins, WIM 79 match wins, USO 84 match wins.

Williams now trails only Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles. (During Court's Australian Open wins from 1960 to 1964, there were less than 50 athletes per Australian Open. Current Grand Slams have 128 athletes in every main draw. This is why there is often a reference to the Open Era which started in 1968. 13 of Court's 24 Grand Slam singles titles came before the Open Era.) Williams holds a 367-56 singles record in Grand Slams, winning 165 of those since turning 30 years old. Her 367 Grand Slam singles match wins is an Open Era record. Her 2017 Australian Open crown was her 10th Grand Slam singles title since reaching her 30th birthday. No other female player has won more than 3 Grand Slam singles titles after turning 30 years of age. (Note: Steffi Graf was 29 years, 11 months and 22 days when she won Roland Garros on 5 June 1999, shortly before retiring.) Williams has won 10 of the 12 Grand Slam titles to complete the Box Set (winning the singles, same gender doubles, and mixed doubles in each of the four Grand Slam tournaments). The only 2 she's lacking are the mixed doubles titles at Roland Garros and the Australian Open. Her best finishes in those events were runner-up finishes at the 1998 Roland Garros and 1999 Australian Open. Serena is the only player, male or female, to win 10+ grand slam singles titles in two separate decades (10 in the 2000s and 12 in the 2010s). Has won 6 major titles without dropping a set, tied with Navratilova for the most by any woman in the Open Era.
