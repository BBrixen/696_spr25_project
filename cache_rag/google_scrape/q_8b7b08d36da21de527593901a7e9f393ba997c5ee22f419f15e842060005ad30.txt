Members Online • lmm310 How common is it for a cyclist to win the Tour de France, get beat by another rider, and then come back to beat the same rider? Just for Fun We are nearing the Tour de France, with the two main characters of the last 4 editions arriving to the race under very different circumstances. Tadej Pogacar's dominance at the Giro d'Italia cannot be overstated: biggest Grand Tour winning margin in 40 years (Laurent Fignon, 1984 Tour de France, 10 minutes and 32 seconds); biggest Giro d'Italia winning margin in 59 years (Vittorio Adorni, 1965 Giro d'Italia, 11 minutes and 26 seconds); most stage wins by a Giro d'Italia winner since the great Eddy Merckx in 1973 (6 stages); all but one possible day in pink, etc. This Giro performance follows an outstanding start to the season, despite the relatively light race schedule, as he targets the Giro-Tour double: 1st in Strade Bianche, 3rd in Milano-San Remo, the overall plus 4 stage wins at the Vuelta a Catalunya, and the 6th monument win of his career at Liege-Bastogne-Liege. We are quite possibly witnessing peak Pogi. Jonas Vingegaard's start to the season was not less impressive though, with convincing wins at the O Gran Camiño (GC+ 3 stage wins) and Tirreno-Adriatico (GC + 2 stage wins). As we all know though, a horror crash at the Vuelta al Pais Vasco has derailed Vingegaard's preparation for the Tour de France. As of right now, Team Visma LAB still claim that Jonas Vingegaard's participation in the Tour is not certain, despite news he has started an altitude camp to prepare for the race. If he does end up participating, which is looking more and more probable, it is likely that we won't have Jonas Vingegaard at his full strength in the Tour the France. With Jonas not quite at 100%, Pogacar has a fantastic opportunity to regain his Tour de France title. And, surprisingly, he would be part of a very select group of cyclist who have managed to do so. In the history of the Tour de France it is rare for a rider to win non-consecutive editions, even rarer to do so while finishing an edition between two wins, even rarer to be able to come back and beat someone who took him off the top spot. In fact, only 3 cyclists have ever managed to do it. To be clear, this is what I looked for: Year 1: Rider A wins the Tour de France Year 2: Rider B wins the Tour de France, rider A participates and finishes but doesn't win Year 3: Rider A wins the Tour de France again, while rider B participates and finishes This removes any scenarios where rider A or B didn't win because they did not finish or did not participate in the race. Also I am not counting scenarios like: Year 1: Rider A wins the Tour de France Year 2: Rider X wins the Tour de France, rider B finishes 2nd, rider A finished 3rd Year 3: Rider A wins the Tour de France again, rider B finishes 2nd, rider X does not participate In this case you could argue it fits the requisite of rider A winning, getting beaten by B and then beating B again, but it doesn't really count since B didn't actually win the race. We are looking for rider who reached the top, got straight up, unequivocally beaten by someone else, and then came back to do the same to them. So, here's the riders who have accomplished this: Jacques Anquetil: Won Tour de France 1957 DNF in 1958 3rd in 1959, won by Bahamontes DNP in 1960 Won in 1961 but Bahamontes DNP Won in 1962, 1963 and 1964, with Bahamontes finishing in 14th, 2nd and 3rd, respectively Antonin Magne: Won Tour de France in 1931 DNP in 1932 8th in 1933. won by Georges Speicher Won in 1934, with Speicher finishing 11th Firmin Lambot: Won Tour de France 1919 3rd in 1920, won by Philippe Thys 9th in 1921, won by León Scieur Won in 1922, with Scieur DNF'ing but Thys finishing 14th I found it quite surprising that only 3 cyclist have achieved this, the last one over 60 years ago. However, there haven't been that many cases of riders winning non-consecutive Tours (13 in total) Other riders who won non-consecutive Tours and why they don't fit the requisites: Philippe Thys - Won 1913, 1914, 1920 - There was only 1 edition between 1914 and 1920 because of WWI, won by the previously mentioned Lambot who also finished 3rd in 1920, but Thys DNF'd the 1919 edition so Lambot didn't actually beat him there André Leducq - Won 1930, 1932 - Was beaten by Magne in the 1931 edition (Leducq finished 10th) but Magne did not participate in the 1932 edition and so Leducq did not have a chance to get revenge Gino Bartali - Won 1938, 1948 - Only 2 editions between both of Bartali's wins due to WWII, and he did not participate in either of them Fausto Coppi - Won 1949, 1952 - Was 10th in the 1951 edition, won by Hugo Koblet, who did not participate in Coppi's second win Eddy Merckx - Won 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1974 - Merckx took a break from the Tour in 1973 to instead terrorize Spain in la Vuelta. I'm sure Luis Ocaña (1973 Tour de France winner) appreciated it Bernard Thévenet - Thévenet is probably the closest case that doesn't quite fit here. He won Tour de France in 1975. In 1976 he was 18th with no shot at overall victory when he DNF'd, with just 3 days left in the race won by Lucien Van Impe. Thévenet returned the following year, winning the race with Van Impe finishing 3rd Bernard Hinault - Won 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1985 - Left the 1980 edition due to tendinitis after the 12th stage, while leading the overall classification by 21 seconds over Joop Zoetemelk, who would eventually win GC. Did not participate in the 1983 edition and finished second in the 1984 edition, both of which were won by Laurent Fignon, who was himself prevented from participating in the 1985 edition due to injury, which would be Hinault's final Tour overall win. Greg Lemond - Won 1986, 1989, 1990 - Did not participate in the 1987 and 1988 editions as he was recovering from a hunting accident Alberto Contador - Won 2007, 2009, 2010 - Did not participate in 2008, instead doing the Giro-Vuelta double, after his Astana team was banned from the 2008 edition Chris Froome - Won 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017 - Abandoned the 2014 edition after several crashes in the initial stages Like I said in the beginning of the post, Pogacar has a shot at becoming the 4th rider to actually come back and take revenge on the man who took him out of the top step. But, interestingly, he is not the only one participating in the race who has a chance to do it: Christopher Froome: Finished the 2018 (3rd) and 2021 (133rd) editions, won by Geraint Thomas and Tadej Pogacar, respectively. Geraint Thomas: Finished the 2019 (2nd), 2021(41st) and 2022 (3rd) editions, won by Egan Bernal, Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard, respectively Egan Bernal: Finished the 2023 (36th) edition, won by Jonas Vingegaard So we have an incredible 4 riders who can make history this year! (I think you know who my bet's on though...) Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. New to Reddit?
