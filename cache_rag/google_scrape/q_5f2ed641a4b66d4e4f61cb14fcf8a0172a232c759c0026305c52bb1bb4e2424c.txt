The announcement was shared by Tesla CEO Elon Musk in a recent post on Twitter. Musk did not share details about the upcoming event, though previous tweets about Tesla‚Äôs AI Day suggest that the company would be going over the progress it has made in software and hardware, both in terms of training and inference. The CEO also previously mentioned that AI Day‚Äôs primary purpose is recruitment. Tesla AI Day August 19th‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 29, 2021 Tesla has held two special events dedicated to its technology in the past, and both times, the company‚Äôs main message ended up largely lost in translation. During Autonomy Day in April 2019 , Tesla revealed the work it has done to develop its Hardware 3.0 computer, as well as a thorough discussion of how Autopilot training was done. Mainstream media coverage following the event, however, primarily focused on a misinterpreted interpretation of Musk‚Äôs Robotaxi forecast. The same was true when Tesla held its Battery Day last September. The company thoroughly discussed its battery tech, particularly its 4680 cells, in the event, but a good amount of the event‚Äôs coverage simply focused on the fact that Tesla did not bring a sample of its new cell onstage. Convincing the best AI talent to join Tesla is the sole goal‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 29, 2021 It would then be interesting to see how Tesla approaches its AI Day. With such a specialized topic and considering the company‚Äôs experience in the subject, there is a fair chance that discussions and updates on the company‚Äôs AI efforts may be lost in translation once more. However, AI Day‚Äôs primary purpose is for recruitment, so even an event that proves too technical for the layman would likely be appreciated by its target audience. Advertisement With Tesla‚Äôs AI Day set for August 19, there seems to be a chance that the company may integrate the event with its 2021 Annual Shareholder Meeting. This was the strategy employed by Tesla last year when it held the 2020 Annual Shareholder Meeting right before Battery Day. The Teslarati team would appreciate hearing from you.

Published 2 hours ago on April 29, 2025 By Simon Alvarez Credit: Tesla Semi/X Tesla seems to be putting a lot of effort into growing its Semi team. As per recent reports, the company has hired over 1,000 factory workers in Nevada for its Semi program. The update was initially reported by Insider , which cited three people reportedly familiar with the matter. Bigger Semi Team As per the publication‚Äôs sources, Tesla has reportedly hired over a thousand new factory workers for the Semi program in Nevada. The hiring ramp is reportedly part of the company‚Äôs efforts to fulfill the orders for the Semi, which have been accumulating for years. To help the new members of the Semi team, Tesla has reportedly brought in the new workers to Giga Nevada for training and tours over the past months. These efforts are quite a notable update for the Semi program, the publication‚Äôs sources claimed, since less than 100 factory workers were reportedly assigned to the Class 8 all-electric truck until recently. Tesla has not issued a comment about the matter as of writing. Advertisement Tesla Semi Jobs and Updates Insider ‚Äôs report came amidst a hiring ramp in Tesla‚Äôs Careers website . As per previous reports, Tesla‚Äôs Careers website has uploaded over 80 positions related to the Semi program. The positions are varied, with listings being posted for engineering-related roles in Palo Alto, California, to manufacturing-related roles in Sparks, Nevada, and vehicle service-related roles in Sacramento, California. Tesla also shared a recent video of the ongoing progress of the Semi factory‚Äôs construction near Giga Nevada. As per Tesla Semi program lead Dan Priestley, the company has spent the last few months building the facility‚Äôs shell, so efforts are now underway to equip the factory with production equipment. The Tesla executive also reiterated the company‚Äôs target of producing 50,000 units of the Semi annually from its Nevada factory.

Published 5 hours ago on April 29, 2025 By Simon Alvarez Credit: Elon Musk/X Following the first quarter Tesla earnings call, CEO Elon Musk seems to have become a bit more relaxed‚Äîrelaxed enough to joke about fighting a gorilla with 99 other people, at least. It‚Äôs a good sign, if any, that the overworked Musk is becoming a bit more lighthearted again and not too busy picking fights with politicians on social media. The Viral 100 Men vs 1 Gorilla Challenge Over the weekend, a post on social media platform X went viral. The post itself was quite simple, with user @DreamChasnMike stating that he thinks 100 men could beat one gorilla. ‚ÄúEverybody just gotta be dedicated to the sh*t,‚Äù the X user joked. The post exploded on the platform , garnering 284 million impressions as of writing. i think 100 niggas could beat 1 gorilla everybody just gotta be dedicated to the shitüòÇüòÇ‚Äî üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è (@DreamChasnMike) April 25, 2025 The silly question also triggered a massive debate about whether 100 men would really stand a chance against a literal gorilla. Some users even lamented that the premise was a sign of male hubris. Nevertheless, the question proved to be a fun topic on X, with some more dedicated users even posting simulated videos of what the ‚Äú100 Men vs 1 Gorilla Challenge‚Äù could look like. 100 men vs 1 Gorilla Who you got? $MVG I got 1 Gorilla. pic.twitter.com/b7vKKLgduH ‚Äî Crypto_Moony (@knicksreek) April 27, 2025 Mr. Beast and Elon Musk Join In The premise is quite similar to other viral videos from noted YouTube creator Mr. Beast , so it was no surprise that edited images of Mr. Beast YouTube thumbnails with ‚Äú100 Men vs a Gorilla‚Äù also started spreading on the social media platform. Mr. Beast, who tends to be game to such silly ideas, actually reposted the edited image, joking ‚ÄúNeed 100 men to test this, any volunteers?‚Äù Advertisement Need 100 men to test this, any volunteers? pic.twitter.com/p2iQvOWbYJ ‚Äî MrBeast (@MrBeast) April 28, 2025 In true Elon Musk fashion , the Tesla and SpaceX CEO noted that he would join the challenge. ‚ÄúSure, what‚Äôs the worst that could happen‚Äù Musk wrote in his post on X. Musk‚Äôs reply triggered quite a few laughs on X, with some stating that the world probably still needs the CEO. Sure, what‚Äôs the worst that could happen?‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 29, 2025 While silly, Musk‚Äôs comment and his recent, more frequent posts about his companies‚Äô products like Starlink and Grok have been received well by his supporters. Over the past months, after all, Musk has been very political and quite confrontational on social media. With Musk soon taking a step back from the Department of Government Efficiency‚Äôs (DOGE) daily operations, however, it seems like X will soon get a more tempered and lighthearted Elon Musk once more. Continue Reading News Big Tesla win? Sec Lutnick says cars with 85% domestic content will face zero tariffs That‚Äôs a big competitive advantage for Tesla‚Äôs best-selling vehicle. Published 6 hours ago on April 29, 2025 By Simon Alvarez Credit: Tesla Europe & Middle East/X It appears that Tesla may see itself with a notable advantage in the United States. This is, at least, as per recent comments from United States Commerce Secretary¬†Howard Lutnick. Lutnick‚Äôs Comments In recent comments to reporters, Lutnick stated that vehicles finished in the United States with 85% domestic content will have no tariff applied, as noted in a report from The Guardian . Automakers that meet this threshold stand to gain an advantage in the U.S. auto sector, especially considering the Trump administration‚Äôs aggressive tariffs. As per Lutnick, the administration‚Äôs auto tariffs will apply to foreign carmakers that are building their vehicles in the United States. ‚ÄúThis is ‚Äòfinish your cars in America and you win‚Äô,‚Äù¬†Lutnick stated. JUST IN: Commerce Secretary Lutnick says auto tariff relief is coming ‚Ä¢ Cars manufactured with at least 85% of domestic content will face ZERO tariffs ‚Ä¢ US automakers will receive credit up to 15% of the value of vehicles to offset cost of imported parts‚Äî Morning Brew ‚òïÔ∏è (@MorningBrew) April 29, 2025 Big Tesla Advantage Lutnick‚Äôs comments were received positively by Tesla watchers on social media, many of whom noted that the threshold would probably be met only by the electric vehicle maker‚Äôs cars. Teslas that are sold in the United States are built in the United States , and they have consistently ranked among the most American cars in the country for several years running. Advertisement Back in December, for example, American University‚Äôs Kogod School of Business released its Made in America Auto Index , which explores the total domestic content of vehicles that are available for purchase today. In its rankings, only three vehicles received a total domestic content score of 85% or higher‚Äîthe Tesla Model Y, Model Y Long Range, and the Model 3 Performance. The two Model Y variants received a total domestic content score of 85%, while the Model 3 Performance had a total domestic content of 87.5%. If Secretary Lutnick‚Äôs comments are any indication, these three vehicles would be subjected to zero tariffs. This bodes well for Tesla, as the Model Y is the company‚Äôs best-selling vehicle by a notable margin.
