Greatest Tennis Match of Every Year- Women’s Edition – Ramblings of the Ultimate Sports Sentimentalist Ramblings of the Ultimate Sports Sentimentalist Where Sports Analytics and Emotionality Intersect Menu Skip to content Home About Me September 22, 2020 September 22, 2020 ADA_Deacon Greatest Tennis Match of Every Year- Women’s Edition This is my eighth (and likely final) installment of the COVID-19 sports reflection lists that have become so popular on this blog.  To read the previous three articles in this anthology, you can click on the following links: the greatest college football regular season games by year , the greatest college football postseason games by year , the greatest Wake Forest games by year , NCAA tournament upset analysis , ranking every NCAA tournament , the greatest NCAA tournament games by year , and greatest men’s tennis match by year .   I just finished with my list of greatest men’s matches of all-time so it is only right that I also do the same for the ladies, especially since women’s tennis reigns supreme in popularity amongst all female sports relative to their male counterparts. I have scoured the internet, as well as other sources, and have not find anyone that has compiled a thorough list of the best tennis match of every year from the first grand slam in 1884 to today.  There have been many rankings of the greatest matches of all-time ( Bleacher Report , Tennis Predict , The Top Tens , Sports Retriever , Steve Flink’s well-written book , and USA Today ) which I have utilized in my analysis, but no one to my knowledge, has actually selected the best match for every year women’s mainstream tennis has been played, like you will see below. I established a few ground rules going into this, and the biggest one is that grand slam matches are so much more meaningful that other tour matches that the list is almost entirely composed of matches played in the four majors.  I also took into account several factors when determining which match was truly the best for a particular year, including the match’s significance in determining the ultimate tournament champion (finals inherently mean more), the improbability of the final outcome, and the overall excitement of the match. Without further ado, here is my selection for the match of the year for every year  women’s tennis has been played .  The matches in bold I have listed are my selections for the best of that particular decade, and as always feel free to comment or debate. 1884 Maud Watson defeats Lilian Watson 6-8, 6-3, 6-3 (Wimbledon Final) An epic battle of sisters decides the inaugural Wimbledon title (portrait of match pictured above).

The same could not be said for the ladies, however, as the United States Open lays claim to the most matches of the year all-time.  Interestingly, though, Wimbledon still had a firm grasp on the most matches of the decade as they have hosted nine of these fourteen matches. Best Matches by Tournament US Open 49 Wimbledon 43 French Open 24 Australian Open 18 Irish Open 2 Carlton Club 1 Matches of the Decade by Tournament Wimbledon 9 US Open 3 Australian 1 Carlton Club 1 The final analysis I conducted was the match of the year by player.  This is an important analysis because I feel like my results accurately reflect tennis’ most iconic players.  It is one thing to roll over competition to win several grand slams like the Williams’ sisters did in the early 2000’s, but the most memorable and iconic players are the ones who won a multitude of classic matches like the ones featured on this list.  You will see that atop this list stands one of America’s most recognizable women’s tennis players, Chris Evert. Matches of the year by player (multiples only) Chris Evert 11 5-6 Martina Navritalova 10 6-4 Steffi Graf 10 5-5 Margaret Court 7 6-1 Serena Williams 7 3-4 Blance Hillyard 6 4-2 Louise Brough 6 2-4 Paulie Betz 5 3-2 Helen Jacobs 5 2-3 Molla Bjurstedt 4 4-0 Charlotte Cooper 4 2-2 Helen Willis 4 2-2 Billie Jean King 4 2-2 Aranxta Sanchez Vicario 4 2-2 Jennifer Capriati 4 2-2 Venus Williams 4 2-2 Doris Hart 4 1-3 Evonne Goolagong 4 1-3 Maureen Connolly 3 3-0 Maria Bueno 3 2-1 Mary Browne 3 2-1 Dorothy Round 3 2-1 Margaret Osborne 3 2-1 Elisabeth Moore 3 1-2 Lesley Turner 3 1-2 Maria Sharapova 3 1-2 Lillian Watson 3 0-3 Martina Hingis 3 0-3 Simona Halep 3 0-3 Alice Marble 2 2-0 Daphne Akhurst 2 2-0 Suzanne Lenglen 2 2-0 Juliette Atkinson 2 2-0 Mabel Cahill 2 2-0 Angela Mortimer 2 2-0 Monica Seles 2 2-0 Christine Truman 2 1-1 Darlene Hard 2 1-1 Carrie Neely 2 1-1 Lena Rice 2 1-1 Marie Wagner 2 1-1 Hazel Hotchkiss 2 1-1 Eileen Bennett 2 1-1 Kim Clijsters 2 1-1 Justine Henin 2 1-1 Sylvia Lance 2 0-2 Marion Jones 2 0-2 Edith Austin 2 0-2 Ethel Thomson 2 0-2 Petra Kvitova 2 0-2 Matches of the Decade by Player (multiples only) Martina Navritalova 2 2-0 Suzanne Lenglen 2 2-0 Helen Willis 2 1-1 Steffi Graf 2 1-1 I have decided that I am going to do one more additional Covid-19 reflection list and that is going to be the best golf tournament by year.
