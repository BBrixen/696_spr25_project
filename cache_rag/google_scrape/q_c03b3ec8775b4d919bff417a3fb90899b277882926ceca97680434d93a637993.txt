The award is named after Robert "Tiny" Maxwell , a Swarthmore College football player, coach, and sportswriter. Johnny Lattner (1952, 1953) and Tim Tebow (2007, 2008) are the only players to have won the award twice. Since 2014 (the beginning of the College Football Playoff era), the Maxwell Award winner has gone on to win the Heisman Trophy during the same voting cycle in every year except 2018 ( Tua Tagovailoa ), 2023 ( Michael Penix Jr. ), and 2024 ( Ashton Jeanty ). It is the college equivalent of the Bert Bell Award of the National Football League , also given out by the Maxwell Club.
