For other uses, see Priscilla Chan (disambiguation) . Priscilla Chan Chan at SXSW in 2025 Born ( 1985-02-24 ) February 24, 1985 (age 40) Braintree, Massachusetts , U.S. Education Harvard University ( BS ) University of California, San Francisco ( MD ) Occupations Pediatrician philanthropist Title Co-founder and co-CEO of Chan Zuckerberg Initiative [ 1 ] Spouse Mark Zuckerberg ​ ( m. 2012) ​ Children 3 Priscilla Chan (born February 24, 1985) [ 2 ] is an American pediatrician and philanthropist. [ 3 ] She and her husband, Mark Zuckerberg , a co-founder and CEO of Meta Platforms , established the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in December 2015 with a pledge to transfer 99 percent of their Facebook shares, then valued at $45 billion. She attended Harvard University and received her medical degree from the University of California, San Francisco . Early life and education [ edit ] Chan was born in Braintree, Massachusetts , [ 4 ] and grew up in Quincy, Massachusetts . Her parents were Chinese refugees who fled Vietnam in boats . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Chan grew up speaking Cantonese and interpreted for her grandparents who raised her and her  two younger sisters, Michelle and Elaine, while her parents worked. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Chan's father owned a restaurant in Massachusetts, which he later sold to run a wholesale fish company in 2006. Chan graduated valedictorian of her class from Quincy High School , [ 7 ] where she was involved with the FIRST Robotics Competition team #69 HYPER [ 9 ] [ 10 ] and where she was the captain of the tennis team. [ 10 ] Her classmates voted her "Class Genius." [ 8 ] Although her parents were supportive of college education, they were unfamiliar with the process, including the SAT exam. [ 8 ] Chan is the first college graduate in her family and has said that "education is an incredibly personal issue" for her, noting that "[i]f you're the first generation to go to college...sometimes you don't realize your potential until others point it out." [ 7 ] [ 11 ] She credits her public school teachers with recognizing hers and for "getting me excited about learning." [ 11 ] Chan received a full scholarship to attend Harvard University . [ 12 ] Feeling out of place at the school, Chan planned to transfer to another institution; however, her involvement with the Franklin Afterschool Enrichment program, specifically an encounter with a young girl who had broken teeth, inspired Chan to stay and to become a pediatrician. [ 13 ] [ 12 ] Chan once reflected: “I was devastated. I thought, ‘What happened? What did I do wrong? I thought at the time, ‘I am not enough yet. … I need more skills. I need more power to be able to solve this.’ And so, when you're 20 years old and a type-A Harvard student, the answer is medical school.” [ 12 ] After graduating in 2007 with a bachelor's degree in biology, she taught 4th and 5th grade science at the private Harker School in San Jose, California, for a year before entering medical school at the University of California, San Francisco , in 2008, [ 14 ] [ 15 ] where she graduated with a Doctor of Medicine degree in 2012 and then completed residency training in pediatrics in 2015. [ 16 ] [ 7 ] Chan was a pediatrician at San Francisco General Hospital . [ 7 ] Personal life [ edit ] Chan first met Mark Zuckerberg, the future co-founder and CEO of Facebook , at a fraternity party during her freshman year at Harvard University in 2003. [ 17 ] The pair married on May 19, 2012, the day following Facebook's IPO . [ 7 ] They have three daughters, born 2015, 2017, and 2023. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] According to a Facebook post by Zuckerberg, Chan is a Buddhist . [ 22 ] In 2024, a 7-foot-tall (2.1 m) green and silver statue of Chan commissioned by her husband Mark Zuckerberg was unveiled on Zuckerberg's Instagram account. The statue attracted considerable media attention and a debate as to whether it was a strange gesture. [ 23 ] Philanthropy [ edit ] Main article: Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Zuckerberg and Chan have pledged about $4.6 billion to charities, [ 24 ] including a donation of $75 million to San Francisco General Hospital , where Chan worked. [ 7 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] In 2013, they gave 18 million Facebook shares (valued at more than $970 million) to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation . The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed the couple at the top of its list of 50 most generous American philanthropists for that year. [ 27 ] They also pledged $120 million to public schools in the San Francisco Bay Area . [ 6 ] On December 1, 2015, Chan and Zuckerberg posted an open Facebook letter to their newborn daughter. They pledged to transfer 99 percent of their Facebook shares, then valued at $45 billion, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) , a limited liability company that focuses on health and education. [ 6 ] [ 24 ] [ 28 ] In 2016, Chan and CZI co-founded The Primary School , a nonprofit organization that promised to provide K–12 education, prenatal care , early childhood education, primary health care, and other programs and services for free to residents in East Palo Alto, California and the surrounding areas. [ 7 ] [ 28 ] She served as the emeritus board chair of the school. [ 29 ] In 2022, The Primary School received approximately $8 million in donations, and in 2023, the school recorded nearly $4 million in contributions. [ 28 ] In April 2025, CZI announced that it was closing The Primary School's East Palo Alto and San Leandro (East Bay) campuses at the end of the 2025-2026 school year [ 30 ] [ 31 ] "due to a lack of funding". [ 28 ] Chan did not attend meetings announcing the tuition-free school's closure, [ 28 ] and parents are uncertain about what's next for their children. [ 28 ] As part of the school's closure announcement, CZI pledged $50 million over five years to "parent engagement programs, early childhood education and health care services" [ 28 ] in "the East Palo Alto, Belle Haven, and East Bay communities". [ 30 ] Chan handles CZI's day-to-day operations. [ 25 ] Her charitable goals focus on education, healthcare, and science, which are closely tied to her personal background. [ 7 ] She is considered to have had a strong influence on the philanthropy of her husband. [ 6 ] She was one of six nominated for the San Francisco Chronicle ' s third annual Visionary of the Year award in March 2017. The award honors leaders who strive to make the world a better place and also drive change by employing new, innovative business practices. [ 32 ] References [ edit ] ^ "Our Leadership" .
