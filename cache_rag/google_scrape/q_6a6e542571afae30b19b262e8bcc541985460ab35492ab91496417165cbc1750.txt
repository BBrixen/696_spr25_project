Adams October 29, 2019 at 12:52 pm (6 years ago) I loved everyone in the original casting but the change looks like it will be a very good update with excellent actresses and actors so it will be very easy to make the transition. I, for one, can hardly wait for  season 3 of ‘The Crown’ to be made available for viewing! Reply Linda Dietz August 18, 2019 at 2:56 pm (6 years ago) I heard there would be cast changes to The Crown, but I never heard why. While I like many of the stars in the new cast, I really liked all those in the old cast and they had become the people they played. It seems to me these many changes will be hard to get used to. Was this planned from the inception of the series, or did many of the original cast members just sign contracts shorter contracts? Please help me understand. Reply Willow and Thatch August 18, 2019 at 3:53 pm (6 years ago) Yes, it was planned from the start. They didn’t want to artificially age the actors, and thought it best to recast every few years.
