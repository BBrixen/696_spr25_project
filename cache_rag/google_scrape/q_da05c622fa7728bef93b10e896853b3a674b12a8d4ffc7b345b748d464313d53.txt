Babyface Ray The Coochie Man Channels His Inner Gilligan, Enlisting Babyface Ray as The Skipper as they Cast Away on “Coochie Island” in the Video from Jay’s Upcoming Young Wild & Free Mixtape Critical Praise: “There is Bruce Wayne and Batman. Clark Kent and Superman. And now, YN Jay and the Coochie Man” – Pitchfork “Flint, Michigan wouldn’t be one of the hottest scenes in rap without ‘Coochie,’ ‘Coochie World,’ ‘Coochie Scout,’ a mixtape titled Coochie Land , and Coochie Man, the floor-humping alter ego of YN Jay.” – Pitchfork “‘Coochie’ is one of the funniest hip-hop videos of the last five years” – XXL “The Flint native is one of the more eccentric rappers in Michigan, rapping about coochie, using very distinct ‘hold onnnnnnnnnnnnn’ ad-ibs, and starting off songs by asking the producer: ‘Why you always do that mannnnnnnn?’ I’m honestly not sure what these producers are doing while YN Jay is recording in the booth, but whatever it is, it’s working. The music is always wildly entertaining.” – Complex “He raps in different voices, draws out words like they’re self-contained riddles. You never know if he’s entirely serious, but that’s the point.”- SPIN The Video: With ludicrous lyricism, endless energy, and a prolific output volume that rivals entire label catalogs, YN Jay is one of the most entertaining and hardest working artists in music. Connecting with fellow Michigan native Babyface Ray , the Beecher native shares “ Coochie Island .” The bass-thumping, hard-nosed track finds the self-proclaimed “Coochie Man” spitting true-to-style reflections on teen moms, his fear of children (and having them), and his distaste with the state of global affairs, as he raps, “I ain’t tryna have no kids cause this world crazy/No, I ain’t no step-dad but that’s my girl’s baby.” Ray provides a calmer counterpoint to Jay’s “Coochie”-crazed antics, nonchalantly flexing about how his “rose gold Prezi look like Thousand Island.” “Coochie Island” is the latest release from Young Wild & Free , YN Jay’s upcoming mixtape, coming soon via Alamo Records . The Stache House Productions -directed “Coochie Island” video finds YN Jay on the titular temptation island, as the rapper sits with a bevy of bikini-clad baddies. While Jay floats the day away in his canoe, Babyface Ray enters from the side door of the soundstage. After breaking the fourth wall on Jay’s imaginary paradise, Ray jumps into a Jeep armed with orange-tipped toy guns as he blasts away, giving the playful vibe of two kid neighbors on a backyard adventure. YN Jay kicked off 2022 with his Mozzy and Louie Ray -assisted banger, “ Tip Off ,” following a prolific 2021, in which the Alamo Records signee released multiple projects, spark ed several viral trends, and dropped a metric ton of music videos. Furthermore, the Michigan rapper solidified himself as a somewhat mythical figure on TikTok, generating millions of video creations on viral hits like “ Triple S ,” “ Coochie Land ,” and “ Kakashi ,” while his inimitable raps quickly earned co-signs from the likes of Drake and Lil Uzi Vert . Among his 2021 projects was the highly acclaimed Coochie Chronicles , home to singles like “ Slow Motion ” and the Coi Leray-assisted, “ Triple S Remix .” Receiving praise from Pitchfork , The FADER , and more, the project ushers listeners into Jay’s sex-crazed mind, wielding his slip-sliding, start-stopping flow as he unleashes a torrent of punchlines and outrageous boasts. Coochie Chronicles is also home to Jay’s signature song, “ Coochie ,” a collaboration with “Tip Off” featured artist and close friend, Louie Ray, which boasts over 32 million views on YouTube. Stay tuned for much more from the “Coochie Man,” including plenty of new music, as 2022 rolls on. Watch “Coochie Island” ft.

The Background: “It’s scary how easy it is for me to make music,” admits 21-year-old rapper YN Jay. This is true of his 2020 hit “Coochie” and the follow-up album Coochie Land. “It was made in three minutes, easily, and the video did 30 million views. I’ve been writing songs to go a certain way my whole life, but it never worked. Now, I’m not overthinking it, and it’s making me a star.” After over a decade at the mic, the Beecher, Michigan native has given rap fans an alternative to music about violence and drugs. Amid his rise, Jay got cosigns from Drake and Lil Uzi Vert. While Drizzy and Jay are exploring music, he recorded extensively with Uzi. The same night the two discussed collaborating, Jay stopped everything to drive to Philly. “I pulled up; we did damn near eight songs.” One track, the “coochie”-inspired “HOLD ONNNNN,” promises to release during an exciting 2021. Fresh off of Ninja Warrior—an album featuring Lil Yachty and Sada Baby that he conceptualized and recorded in a single day, YN Jay recently signed a deal with Alamo Records and is focused on showcasing his versatility and staying power. “I’m working on a few albums and letting the world know how big this is. Anybody can be a rapper; I’m trying to catch the culture and update the game.” Links: instagram | youtube | tiktok | soundcloud | spotify | apple “Coochie Island” ft.

Yeat Taz Taylor’s Dominant Collective Recruit One of Rap’s Hottest Risers to Bring the Rage Critical Praise: “[Internet Money] grew into a music industry powerhouse that helped break stars like Juice WRLD and Lil Tecca, racking up dozens of Billboard hits and platinum plaques in the process.” – Complex “The group of beatmakers is dominating music-streaming services” – Billboard “It seems only inevitable that these guys are just going to continue to take the world by storm, one hit at a time.” – MTV “Even if you aren’t familiar with L.A. production collective Internet Money, you’ve heard their beats. The group’s sounds have powered some of hip-hop’s biggest records in the past couple years, from Rich the Kid’s “Plug Walk” and Juice WRLD’s “Lucid Dreams” to Drake’s “Blue Tint.” The group is helmed by Taz Taylor, a Florida native who — true to his collective’s name — has accumulated a fortune primarily through the internet.” – The FADER The Song: Earning plaques by the handful as they shape the sound of modern rap, Taz Taylor and his ever-growing roster of Internet Money producers expertly craft their beats to accentuate the strengths of their artist collaborators. Turning up the energy level to match the hard-charging tastes of one of rap’s hottest rising stars, Internet Money shares “ No Handoutz ,” the collective’s first collaboration with Yeat . Produced by Rio Leyva , Yeat & Taz Taylor , “No Handoutz” combines buzzing synth melodies, distorted 808s, and of course, tolling bells, creating a carnival-esque canvas for the 22-year-old rapper to do his thing. Manipulating his voice to match the various contours of the instrumental, Yeat unleashes an onslaught of energetic flows, emphatically denouncing those who attempt to bite his style as a shortcut to reaching the top: “They don’t really know ’bout that heat/They ain’t even heard of me/They try to steal my swag/Boy that’s a burglary.” A symbiotic union between oft-imitated SoundCloud titans, the combination of Yëat and Internet Money arrives with internet-breaking force. The electrifying “No Handoutz” is the latest release from Internet Money, who have proven they can make magic with some of the rap game’s most singular stars. “No Handoutz” follows “Options” ft. 24kGoldn , a punchy, guitar-driven collaboration with a pop-punk edge. They kicked off the year with “Flossin ,” a high-octane banger featuring NBA YoungBoy , taking the firebrand’s bayou-bred sound and giving it the 4K treatment. Debuting at #72 on the Billboard Hot 100 upon its release in February, the glistening track has racked up over 17.6 million streams on Spotify alone. “Options,” “Flossin’,” and “No Handoutz” continue Internet Money’s mission to grow their empire in 2022. The new singles, along with the rise of IM-affiliated artists like Dro Kenji , Rotken , and Rich Amiri , continue the momentum that the pioneering artist-producer collective carried in 2021. Just last year, Internet Money earned over 40 RIAA plaques on songs they produced , including hits by Juice Wrld , Polo G , Lil Tecca , and The Kid Laroi . In addition to the new wall full of plaques, IM producers Nick Mira and DT earned a GRAMMY nomination for their work on Lil Nas X’s MONTERO . Internet Money found success as lead artists with the GOLD certified “ His & Hers ,” a sparkling collab with Don Toliver , Gunna , and Lil Uzi Vert , which debuted at #67 on the Billboard Hot 100 , racked up over 26 million views on the Cole Bennett -directed video , earned a spot as one of the Top Global Tracks on TikTok, and received recognition from Complex , who named it the 26th best song of 2021 . “His & Hers” was a worthy follow-up to “ Lemonade ” ft. Gunna, Don Toliver & NAV , the triple-Platinum, Billboard Top 10 2020 hit from B4 The Storm , Internet Money’s star-studded first full-length. After two years cooking up hits and armed with a brand new studio in Santa Monica, CA, Internet Money is ready to show the world how much they’ve grown. With a collaborations on the way that range from the rap game’s biggest stars to its most notable rising names and über-talented Internet Money Records signees, stay tuned for much more music from Internet Money as they continue to advance Taz Taylor’s industry-conquering ambitions. Buy/Stream “No Handoutz” ft. Yeat: https://internetmoney.lnk.to/nohandoutz For more info, please contact: Audible Treats: Michelle , Kerry or Kevin 10K Projects: Hannah The Background: Internet Money Background: Starting as a type-beat factory and growing into a global powerhouse, Taz Taylor and Internet Money have earned 3 Grammy nominations, 58 platinum plaques, 33 gold, and 14 Billboard #1 hits since 2018. The collective is behind some of the biggest rap and R&B hits of the past few years, including Juice WRLD’s “Lucid Dreams” (1.3 billion Spotify streams), Trevor Daniel’s “Falling” (#1 Billboard Mainstream Pop, 37 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 with #17 peak), Lil Tecca’s “Ransom” (700 million Spotify streams, #4 Hot 100), and XXXTentacion’s “Fuck Love” ft. Trippie Redd (the most-played song in SoundCloud history). With 2020’s B4 The Storm album, and its double-platinum single “Lemonade” ft. Gunna, Don Toliver & NAV, Taz Taylor and Internet Money confirmed their status as the music industry’s most powerful hitmaking collective. Internet Money was born out of necessity, a hybrid company that has filled in the gaps between the rap industry, the producer community, and the online marketplace. Disillusioned with the industry, and the way he saw rap producers being taken advantage of, Taz Taylor formed the collective in 2016 as a way to share the knowledge he’d gained from years spent selling his “type beats” online and navigating the internet’s ever-growing impact on the production landscape. Four years in, Internet Money has expanded as a collective, including Grammy-nominated producers like Nick Mira and JR Hitmaker , and produced for Drake , Trippie Redd , Juice WRLD , and many more. “When you’re in Internet Money, you get the same opportunities that I do, you’re gonna be working with the same artists that I’m working with, and getting credits with them,” Taylor says. “Instead of working with a bunch of people we don’t know, we just have our own network that’s one big family.” Following their success breaking major artists like Trevor Daniel , and co-producing his multi-platinum hit “ Falling ,” Taylor and Internet Money partnered with Elliot Grange’s 10K Projects in 2019 to launch their own label. Taz Taylor Background: Taz Taylor has never cared about fame or clout. To hear the multi-platinum producer and Internet Money founder tell it, everything he’s done — from turning his online production hustle selling “type beats” into a $500,000 per year business to forming his own label — has been born out of necessity and guided by intuition. “I’ve been so tunnel vision during the last five years to make sure I got to this point,” he says. “It was just like, Let’s keep building .” Though Taylor has only been in the industry for a few years, his accomplishments in that time have come at a staggering pace, notching, by his estimation, over 500 placements and around 200 gold and platinum plaques between himself and the other producers on his Internet Money team. As their leader, Taylor has quickly become a new sort of rap mogul, one who’s built his steadily growing empire from a deep knowledge of the ways music moves online, and he’s done it all from the humblest of beginnings.

The hip-hop elite is taking notice.” – The FADER “Elmo Kennedy O’Connor was in pre-school when he became obsessed with the Southern artists of No Limit and Cash Money. Later in life, he would adopt the rap moniker Bones and amass a significant cult following. His gothic lyrical style, allergy to songs longer than two and a half minutes, and lo-fi visual aesthetic have convinced a quarter million people to subscribe to the SoundCloud page of his rap collective, TeamSESH.” – HotNewHipHop The Album: He’s a veteran in the underground rap scene, but BONES has the restless energy and hard-hitting flow of an artist with something to prove. Affirming his rap royalty status, BONES shares Withered , his new project. Created in collaboration with producer grayera , a fellow TeamSESH member who has connected with BONES in the past for fan favorite, “ LooseScrew ” ft. Eddy Baker , Withered finds BONES alternating between laid-back yet emotional anthems and commanding, verbally blunt bangers. The seamless production from grayera pairs perfectly with each track’s lyrics and ranges from tough 808’s all the way to guitar-led beats. The project is home to “ TheOne ,” an emotionally-charged highlight track released earlier this year. In his classic BONES style, the album’s emotions vary from adoring odes to his loved ones on “ SlayTheDragon,SaveThePrincess ,” before transitioning to the confident chants of “ EarlGrey ,” that assert  he’ll always come out on top. The underground king admits his addiction to his ambitious release schedule on “ Propellers ”, rapping: “With this rap sh*t, all I do drop, drop, drop / Like a habit, gotta have it, never stop, stop, stop.” Featuring a single feature from Lady Moon, the rare guest vocalist to appear on a BONES project, Withered is available everywhere now via TeamSESH/EMPIRE . Withered marks BONES’ first full length project of 2022 and comes shortly after global artist Justin Bieber cosigned the TeamSESH founder by lip syncing his 2019 hit “ AirplaneMode ” (49 million Spotify streams). Earlier this month, BONES connected up original TeamSESH member ghost/\/ghoul to drop “ Silverado ,” a single off of the duo’s upcoming collaborative album, DreamCard due later this year. 2021 was a remarkably busy year for BONES, marked by five full-length albums including Scraps w/ Lyson , ForbiddenImage w/ catsoup , InLovingMemory , PushingUpDaisies w/ Deergod , and BURDEN . If there’s one thing to know for sure about BONES, it’s that there’s always another project on the way. Stay tuned for what’s next from the man that never stops working.

The Background: BONES has proven to be one of the most enduring, influential, and creative hip-hop artists to emerge in the early 2010s. The TeamSESH founder has recorded dozens of albums, racking up hundreds of millions of streams and feeding a fanbase that eagerly awaits his every move. Despite remaining fiercely independent and true to his underground roots, his music has permeated the mainstream–in 2015, A$AP Rocky sampled BONES’ song “Dirt” for “Canal St.” (124 million streams), and in recent years, BONES has performed in prime slots at festivals such as Rolling Loud as a member of Seshollowaterboyz (along with Xavier Wülf, Chris Travis, and Eddy Baker).

Artist Holds Court During a House Party in a Kinetic New Video, His First Release of 2022 Critical Praise: “ Best New Artist for September 2021 : It’s clear My Favorite Color is okay not taking himself too seriously and letting the music speak for itself.” – Pigeons & Planes “The Pittsburgh MC once again flashes signs of brilliance on his new song ‘Old News.’ His zany personality and frenetic flow are the main drivers of his fun-filled anthem.” – Billboard “He truly brings you on a sonic journey that contains so many different styles, sounds, and narratives, you have no choice but to pay attention.” – Lyrical Lemonade “His music is powerful. Each bar drips with the confusion and existential dread of a man who feels out of place in his world.” – Noisey The Video: Playfully experimenting with inventive flows and offbeat punchlines, My Favorite Color is charting his own path through the modern rap game. Taking time to get some things of his chest, the young artist shares “Frustrated ,” his new video single. An energetic airing of grievances from the L.A.-via-Pittsburgh rapper, “Frustrated” finds My Favorite Color chews over his phrasing, delivering each line in an unexpectedly entrancing fashion. He paints the edges of the thumping instrumental with immaculately constructed bars, teeming with tics and jokes designed to amuse himself first, and the audience second: “N***s ain’t sh*t b*tch, I’m a feminist.” Shot & edited by Jack Rotter , the video finds the Rostrum Records rapper wilding out at a house party, as he rejects the advances of clout chasers and does his dance on the kitchen counter. “Frustrated” is My Favorite Color’s first new release of 2022, and its kinetic creativity should seem familiar to those who discovered the artist last year. Following the release of his deeply personal debut album Velma in 2020, My Favorite Color used 2021 to show off his technical rhyming chops, keen sense of visuals, and absurdist sense of humor. In “ Old News ,” a bouncily colorful single praised by Billboard (a “flash of brilliance”) and Lyrical Lemonade , MFC worked a fast-moving flow, delivering punchlines at a rapidfire rate. The song was accompanied by a virtuosic music video, in which the artist portrayed multiple characters a la Eddie Murphy, ranging from a kidnap victim, to a possibly untrained pilot, to a truth-telling stand-up comedian. The artist followed “Old News” with “ Mayday ,” a jazzy and off-kilter banger, a lyrical showcase that veers to every corner of the rapper’s mind, mixing party-positive flexes with tongue-twisting geopolitical analysis. “Mayday” and “Old News” displayed the prodigious artistic gifts that inspired Pigeons & Planes to name him a Best New Artist in September 2021. My Favorite Color is currently hard at work on his next project, a wide-ranging effort that properly continues the story he started with Velma . Stay tuned for much more music and eye-popping videos from My Favorite Color in the coming weeks and months on the road to the new album.

Only thing he gotta do is keep his formula and just keep putting out music and he got it” – Lil Baby to XXL “10 Rappers You Should Know Right Now” – Audiomack The Video: With his open-hearted vulnerability and polished vocals, 4PF signee Lil Kee raps not to immortalize his own name, but to carry on the legacy of lost loved ones. Keeping his older brother Lamar’s name alive, Kee shares the video for his new single, “ Letter 2 My Brother .” Backed by the piano runs and weeping guitar riffs of the instrumental provided by the late, multi-platinum producer Turn Me Up Josh , “Letter 2 My Brother” finds Kee struggling to reconcile his internal pain with his stone-faced exterior, rapping, “What you know about crying in front yo n****, it hurts so bad, can’t hold it in/And you feel like going up top, just brought you closer to the end, this s*** don’t feel right.” The ShotByWolf -directed “Letter 2 My Brother” video captures Lil Kee on a visit to the cemetery, walking alone through the rain as he vents his verses as though each bar bursts from his heart before landing on the beat. Picking up music as a creative outlet after the loss of his cousin inspired him to keep his memory alive, Lil Baby hand-picked Lil Kee for his 4PF label roster for his ability to deliver raw street narratives and vulnerable pleas for respite with a naturally potent vocal gravitas. “I can definitely see him up next,” said Lil Baby to XXL . “Only thing he gotta do is keep his formula and just keep putting out music and he got it” Stay tuned for much more from the versatile up-and-comer as the year progresses.

Only time will tell when we really witness him reach his full potential and it will indeed be a beautiful thing to see.” – REVOLT The Video: Selling out shows with his thumping trap anthems, Key Glock is on an unstoppable trajectory toward the top of the rap game. Today, the 24-year-old rising star shares an acoustic performance of his hit “ Ambition For Cash ,” performed with an ensemble of flutes in NYC’s Chinatown. Originally produced by Tay Keith , who chopped up an entrancing flute sample, the new performance–delivered live on the legendary Doyer Street in Manhattan–boils the song down to its essence: Glock’s cash-chasing bars and the song’s infectious woodwind melody. The highlight cut from Glock’s Yellow Tape 2 (Deluxe) recently earned a GOLD certification from the RIAA and is currently a popular sound on TikTok. The live video arrives amidst Glock’s “ SiriusXM Hip Hop Nation Presents: The Yellow Tape Tour ,” his first solo nationwide headlining tour, ten dates of which are sold out .

This week, the community vibed to new hits from familiar faves and took fiery songs from rising artists and made them their own. Take a look at the most interesting trends from a diverse week in TikTok music: The ruler’s back: Lizzo , the self-proclaimed “Queen Of TikTok” returned this week with a new single and a flurry of new posts on her account. The night before releasing her new single “ About Damn Time ,” Lizzo shared a snippet and asked fans to “roast” her in the comments, with the best joke getting a duet. The winner was @CharliePuth , who created an exaggerated dance that Lizzo eagerly imitated . With over 5.5k creations since its official release, “About Damn Time” is picking up steam, powered in part by a dance created by @jaedenraegomez . Lizzo has been incredibly busy on TikTok as the song starts its rise, sharing BTS clips from her recent appearance on SNL , showing highlights from her journey to Coachella to perform with Harry Styles , and promoting Yitty , the new shapewear brand she recently founded. TikTok is an ideal venue for artists and other talented individuals to showcase their skills, and a new sound is helping them show off in style. In late 2021, creator @tejxpatel used a modified version of Memphis rapper Key Glock’s hit “Ambition For Cash” to demonstrate that he’s “in his bag” when he’s shooting and editing breathtaking photographs. With over 150k video creations, the sound has become a go-to for artists, from sculptors to designers of custom Crocs to martial artists , athletes like the Paris St. Germain soccer team and LSU gymnast Olivia Dunne , and artisans of all kinds: folks who make dog beds for humans , aspiring chefs , and more. The official, unmodified “Ambition For Cash” audio is also doing well on the platform, generating over 33k creates and gaining traction within TikTok’s community of fitness influencers and enthusiasts . The TikTok community always has an appetite for emerging artists’ unreleased music. Colorado-based DJ Disco Lines made a splash on TikTok when he previewed a snippet of “ BABY GIRL ,” a song he made while waiting inside of an airport. Garnering over 30K creations to date since its official release in mid-April, the bouncy club song has creators in the mood for  nightlife, as they share their favorite pictures from nights out on the town and offer their best advice for dancing in the club – including recommended dance moves to keep creepy guys away and ways to dance in public while in a relationship . Disco Lines also interacted with the song on his TikTok, sharing his first time playing the track live in front of an audience and announcing that the extended “airplane” version of the song is available everywher e. TikTok consistently gives catalog songs second life, with the 1996 Sting remix of reggae and dancehall legend Shaggy ’s 1995 hit “ Boombastic ” as the latest example sweeping through the platform. Amassing over 400K+ creations, the groovy tune is the perfect sound to soundtrack all types of situations. Creators are taking to the sound to display their excitement about realizing there’s a Taco Bell in the bar , show an unlikely scene of some lifelong friends letting loose on the dance floor during a night out , and demonstrate how to make their favorite cookie and cake-inspired snacks at home . Meanwhile, Shaggy is busy promoting music of his own, previewing his single “Mi Duh Know” and hosting an Open Verse Challenge for aspiring emcees, over 600 of whom have shown their skills atop the strutting beat . Key Glock isn’t the only one inspiring creators to showcase their best work. Inspired by the energetic, video game-like production of Dxrk ダーク’s “ RAVE ” (69.8K+ creations), creators are rewriting some of your favorite cartoon characters’ stories with their own hand-drawn manga series. A few of the videos include scenarios featuring characters from Spongebob Squarepants , Mickey Mouse , and The Simpsons . In other creations, TikTok users show off their gym progress and hilariously react to their discoveries after studying history online . The upbeat track continues to grow beyond TikTok, earning a top 5 spot on Spotify’s Global Viral 50 and more than 9 million Spotify streams. Following the immense success of his tracks like “ STAY ” (8.4M+ creations) and “ WITHOUT YOU ” (2.4M+ creations), The Kid LAROI appears to have another fan-favorite hit on his hands with his new single “ Thousand Miles .” He began to tease the track earlier this month and urged his fans on the app to use the song to soundtrack some of the worst mistakes they’ve made in life . Creators are happily obliging, sharing their past mistakes when it comes to hair , relationships , and getting sandwich stains on their clothes on live television . Contributing to the 6.3K+ creations and counting, The Kid LAROI even used the growing sound to provide a sneak peek into the song’s video shoot . TikTok is excited to announce the launch of #Rompiendo , a new program to highlight the success and impact of Latin music and artists on TikTok. Latin music is a massive and growing style of music on TikTok, and #Rompiendo provides some of the most vital artists with the opportunity to share their voices with the TikTok community even more. #Rompiendo artists will host LIVEs to connect with fans, and their music will be featured on TikTok Radio on Sirius XM (Ch. 4) and on dedicated playlists on the app’s Sounds page. Today, Wednesday April 27th, TikTok announces the first #Rompiendo artist: Brazilian singer Anitta . Anitta achieved massive success on TikTok with her song “ Envolver .” The song, which now has over 2M video creations, broke countless records for both the artist herself and Latin music as a whole after going viral on TikTok. Anitta recently performed at Coachella, and dropped the highly-anticipated album Versions Of Me, home to “Envolver” and other hits.

Lil Keed & Ty Dolla $ign The ATL Trap Star Teams with Older Brother Lil Keed and West Coast Hitmaker Ty Dolla $ign in Luxurious Video Single from The Cheater , Coming May 4th via Alamo Records Critical Praise: “The centerpiece of the mixtape is the hypnotic “Get N Dere Gang,” which I could see holding a permanent place on DJ sets throughout the summer.” – Pitchfork “Lil Gotit is continuing to slither his way to the top of Atlanta’s new wave with the release of his latest project, Top Chef Gotit .” – Complex Since officially stepping into the Rap game in 2017, Gotit has been one of several standout stars to come out of Atlanta’s buzzing scene and he continues to impress with each new release.” – HotNewHipHop “Lil Gotit is the heir to Atlanta’s rap throne” – The FADER The Announcement: ATL’s Lil Gotit has overcome comparisons and expectations, flooding his closet with so much designer footwear along the way that he never worried about filling the shoes of anyone else. With ten toes down and his money on his mind, Lil Gotit returns to share “ Rich Sh*t ,” his new single and music video featuring Ty Dolla $ign and Lil Keed . A bonafide trap slow jam, the track strikes a perfect balance between the brothers’ keen street sensibilities and the tenderness of Ty Dolla’s velveteen vocals. Drawing on topics from the love of the game to the lust of a lover, Gotit croons, “Came up on noodles and Hamburger Helper/Took her on the move, she in love with a stepper/Baby girl hot, she done Peter piped a pepper.” In the video, directed by Bryant , Gotit draws a line between the luxurious life he lives and the dirty work done on his behalf. Keed and Gotit plan a Mission Impossible -style heist, enlisting masked assassins to steal a mysterious golden apple. Meanwhile, Gotit kicks it in a glamorous club with Ty Dolla $ign, pouring cranberry cocktails and messing around in the virtual realm with his white-on-white Oculus. “Rich Sh*t” is the latest single from The Cheater , Gotit’s next project, which he announced last week. The Cheater finds the 22-year-old artist in complete control of his vocal instrument–he’sable to slither his way into unexpected rhythmic pockets and switch on a dime between emotive melodies and percussive rhymes. Home to recent offerings “ She Know It ” and “ Take Care ” ft. Millie Go Lightly & Toosii , The Cheater introduces the mischievous rapper’s latest persona–following in the footsteps of previous projects that presented him as a “Hood Baby” or “Top Chef” or “Superstar Creature.” Proudly polyamorous and persistently pushin’ P, The Cheater is happy to entertain, but never to be trusted. With multiple appearances from Gotit’s brother Lil Keed , as well as YSL affiliates Yak Gotti and Millie Go Lightly and rapping friends Lil Pj and B Slime , the new project is a family affair. The young Alamo Records signee establishes himself as a leader of the rising wave of Atlanta trappers who bring a unique twist to the region’s dominant sound–a wave that includes project guests like CEO Trayle and Enchanting . Beyond Atlanta, the tape welcomes memorable guest spots from Ty Dolla $ign and Memphis risers BIG30 and Lil Double 0 . The Cheater arrives on May 4th via Alamo Records . Watch “Rich Sh*t” ft.

DotComNirvan) Press Release DC The Don Delivers Curbside Smoke in “Donny’s Revenge” (dir. DotComNirvan) Go to Post 4.20.2022 Video: DC The Don – “ Donny’s Revenge ” (Directed by DotComNirvan) The Rostrum Records Artist Unleashes His Inner Evil Twin in New Video As He Prepares to Kick Off the “MOW3 Tour” in Late April Critical Praise: “Not only can he sing with so much emotion behind his words, but he also knows how to masterfully rap as well as switch up his cadences constantly, always keeping you guessing about what he’s going to do next.” – Lyrical Lemonade “Los Angeles by way of Milwaukee’s DC The Don is part rapper, part rockstar, excelling in the melodic and riotous lane popularized by cult heroes like Lil Uzi Vert and Trippie Redd.” – Audiomack The Video: A versatile vibe-setter animated by his fearless creative vision, DC The Don masterfully strikes the balance between melodic anthems (delivered by the more tender side of his personality he calls RAG3 KIDD ) and hard-biting rage raps (courtesy of the devilish, red-haired DONNY ). Ignoring the angel on the other shoulder in favor of his more abominable alter ego, DC shares the new video for “ Donny’s Revenge ” from his recent album, My Own Worst Enemy , available everywhere now via Rostrum Records . Barking hard-hitting bars over a hair-raising, speaker-shaking instrumental, courtesy of Trademark and Ralph , ”Donny’s Revenge” is a take-no-prisoners anthem from the demonic emcee. The DotComNirvan -directed “Donny’s Revenge” video features DC as the titular red-headed rebel, surrounded by the intense stare of floating eyeballs that are sure to see you coming, as well as thick clouds of smoke that he’s sure to deliver to your door. Augmented by comics-inspired animation and Nirvan’s high tech transitions, the black-clad hellraiser swings his blood-red braids with a villainous rage, as he raps: “Ayy, who that? It’s the man/Walked up in your party with a glocky in my pants/He was out of pocket, made him do the shmoney dance/Bro said he don’t want no smoke but he gon’ get it on-demand.” My Own Worst Enemy tells a loose narrative about DC’s inner conflict, which manifests as a battle between two distinct personalities: RAG3 KIDD, who represents the artist’s more wholesome and romantic side, and DONNY, a demonic, red-haired spitter who emerges on the album’s harder-edged beats. The album kicks off in DONNY mode, featuring some of DC’s hardest tracks to date, including the massive “ ENEMIES ,” with a beat that sounds like a malfunctioning supercomputer, and the devilish “ MAKAVELI ,” a fiery lyrical exercise. As the tracklist progresses, RAG3 KIDD makes his presence felt, emoting over candy-coated production on pop culture-referencing tracks like “ iCarly :/ ,” “ Scott Pilgrim ,” and “ Futurama 2099 .” Blending elements of rap, pop-punk, hyperpop, and more, My Own Worst Enemy both expands and refines DC’s sound, allowing the 22-year-old rapper to showcase every facet of his wide-ranging vocal ability. With production by heavy-hitters like JetsonMade , Starboy , Supah Mario , Trademark Charlie Heat , Astroboy , and more, who deliver DC some of their most adventurous beats, MOW3 percolates with the energy of a young artist testing the limits of what he’s capable of accomplishing–and having fun while doing it. Stay tuned for more from the young artist, including the upcoming East Coast leg of his “ MOW3 TOUR ,” kicking off later this month in Philadelphia!

In 2016, at the age of 16 and standing 6’7”, DC moved to Los Angeles to pursue a basketball career under Lavar Ball and alongside teammate LaMelo Ball. During this time, he fell in love with music and used his spare time to make experimental records which suddenly gained traction – As the public became increasingly aware of DC The Don’s talent for rapping, NBA player Lonzo Ball featured his song “Everything 1k” on the first Big Baller Brand shoe commercial, introducing DC The Don’s music to an even wider audience. DC signed to Rostrum Records in 2020, releasing his debut album Come As You Are on August 7th, generating over 125 million streams across platforms. The artist looks to reach another level with My Own Worst Enemy, his ambitious new album, available everywhere now.

The Cheater finds the 22-year-old artist in complete control of his vocal instrument, able to slither his way into unexpected rhythmic pockets and switch on a dime between emotive melodies and percussive rhymes. The Cheater arrives on May 4th via Alamo Records . Leaning into his devilish tendencies, The Cheater explores Gotit’s proud promiscuity, giving 20 new reasons why he should not be trusted. “Sorry baby I can’t help it,” Gotit recently wrote on Instagram . “God Made Me This Way …” The upcoming project is home to “ She Know It ,” a sultry recent single that earned coverage in XXL , REVOLT , HotNewHipHop , and more. “She Know It” boasts an inventive music video, in which Gotit and Lil Keed portray the most formidable wizarding duo since Harry Potter and Ron Weasley and work their trap magic in the halls of Atlanta’s finest wizarding school. “She Know It” followed “ Take Care ,” a melodic banger aided by assistance from Toosii and Millie Go Lightly . “Take Care” and “She Know It” gave fans a glimpse of how Gotit’s style has evolved since Top Chef Gotit, the Gunna -executive produced project from 2021. He has the seal of approval from Gunna , Future , and his mentor Young Thug , but Lil Gotit is out to prove that he no longer needs co-signs. With the upcoming The Cheater , Gotit welcomes the world into the kingdom he’s built and prepares to expand its borders far beyond the confines of Zone 3.

Juicy J, “Guilty Conscience,” and “California,” the 2012 Mixtape is Now Available to Stream On All Platforms via Taylor Gang/Rostrum Records Critical Praise for Taylor Allderdice “Taylor Allderdice is the 8th best album of 2012…When Wiz speaks of spending $30,000 a night on champagne, there’s a feeling that you can do the same, if you smoke enough weed and talk enough sh*t. It’s a notion that can make any song, particularly the well-crafted ones here, sound a lot better.” – Complex “Young Khalifa’s songwriting is as strong as ever, as he continues to pen some of the most toxically inescapable hooks and couplets around.” – XXL “Wiz has upped the ante on the flagrant talk and braggadocio…The prodigal stoner, deservingly, takes his spoils.” – HipHopDX The Release: Multi-platinum selling, Grammy and Golden Globe nominated recording artist Wiz Khalifa grew from grassroots fame to worldwide stardom, but he never forgot his original fans or his roots in Pittsburgh, PA. Today, Wiz celebrates the tenth anniversary of his mixtape Taylor Allderdice , releasing the acclaimed tape to streaming services for the first time. Home to fan favorite hits like “ My Favorite Song ” and “ California ,” Taylor Allderdice is currently available to stream on all platforms via Taylor Gang/Rostrum Records . Released shortly after his debut album and mainstream breakthrough Rolling Papers , Taylor Allderdice served as a message to Wiz’s core fans that even as his profile rose, he would remain the same easy-laughing stoner who roamed the halls of Taylor Allderdice High School in Pittsburgh. The mixtape was a conscious return to the hazy sound he developed in Pittsburgh with his core collaborators, many of whom, including producers like I.D. Labs, Sledgren, Cardo , and Big Jerm , and Taylor Gang artists like Chevy Woods and Lola Monroe , appear on the project. Taylor Allderdice showcased the chemistry between Wiz Khalifa and the newest Taylor Gang signee, legendary rapper/producer Juicy J , who goes back and forth with Wiz on four of the mixtape’s tracks. Each of the tracks on Taylor Allderdice end with snippets of dialogue between Wiz Khalifa and mixtape host Rob Markman , in which Wiz discusses his rise to stardom and answers burning questions with thoughtful defiance. Originally released in March 2012, Taylor Allderdice earned critical acclaim upon release, earning positive reviews in XXL and HipHopDX , and earning the #8 placement in Complex Magazine’s list of Best Albums of 2012 . Boasting an all-star cast of guest artists and a list of early 2010s heavyweights behind the boards, including Lex Luger, Jake One, Harry Fraud , and SpaceGhostPurrp , Taylor Allderdice is an indelible snapshot of a fascinating period in the history of Wiz Khalifa and hip-hop at large. The official release of Taylor Allderdice continues Wiz Khalifa’s efforts to clear his classic mixtapes for streaming services, with the assistance of Rostrum Records. In 2020, the rapper celebrated the 10th anniversary of his classic Kush & Orange Juice mixtape by releasing it to streaming services and printing limited edition vinyl. Later that year, Wiz released “ The Thrill ,” his early single with the memorable Empire Of The Sun sample, to DSPs, earning the approval of the band and listing them as primary artists on the song. Stay tuned for more from Wiz, as the star rapper prepares to deliver more of his blog-era classics to modern streaming formats.

TikTok makes a major impact week-in and week-out on the charts, but sometimes the most interesting trends exist at the margins. This week, not only did TikTok help a favorite artist achieve his first solo number one hit, but the community helped elevate songs from Ghana, Honduras, and Jamaica to internet prominence. Check out some of the most fascinating music trends from recent days: Check out more noteworthy stories from the world of TikTok this week: Star rapper Jack Harlow reached a new career milestone this week, with some help from his large contingent of fans on TikTok. A few weeks ago, Harlow treated TikTok to a preview of his new single “ First Class “, a smooth song that samples Fergie’s 2007 hit “Glamorous.” The song went viral on TikTok in the days before its official release, generating tens of thousands of video creations, with fans begging him to drop and creating silly trends to the song’s dulcet piano tones. Powered by its TikTok success, and over 440k video creations in less than three weeks, including over 50k video creations before its official release, “First Class” made its debut at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 this week. The song is Jack’s first solo number one hit, and his third TikTok-powered song to reach the upper echelons of the pop charts, following his hit “ What’s Poppin ” (400k+ combined creates) and “ Industry Baby ” (1.6 million creates), his collaboration with Lil Nas X . The TikTok community uses a shared taste in music to bond over similar experiences, whether they be good, bad, or simply awkward. Inspired by Ghanaian artist Black Sherif ’s “ Kwaku The Traveller ” (667.2K+ platform and user-generated creations ), creators share a couple of their most embarrassing and awkward interactions with people they know. Black Sherif’s vehemently relatable line, “Of course I f***ed up/Who never f*** up, hands in the air,” resonates with creators who have gotten caught cheating on their partners , accidentally sent screenshots to the wrong person , and unintentionally sent mixed signals to their crush . Black Sherif also interacted with the track on his TikTok page, thanking his followers for their continuing support of the song . Thanks to the TikTok trend, and other skits using the audio , “Kwaku The Traveller” is one of the most popular Ghanaian songs on the platform, generating over 50 million views on the tag #kwakuthetraveller . Despite our best intentions, life doesn’t always end up going according to plan. The TikTok community is proving that this week, to the tune of Honduran artist Pilo Tejeda ’s lively track “ Sopa de Caracol ” (392.5K+ creations). Originally released by Tejeda’s popular 90s band Banda Blanca , the 2022 remastered version of the song is inspiring comedic creations from those who know they should be doing one thing but can’t help but to do another. Creators are using the sound to admit times they ignored things they probably should not have: they can only think about Easter baskets rather than grown-up responsibilities , they zone out and think about dinner in the middle of class , and they haven’t quite taken the leap to move out of their parents’ house . The sound is also perfect for adorable ducklings who like to waddle together in bathroom sinks . Recently on TikTok, creators have been displaying the humorous lessons they are learning about the importance of restraint. Soundtracked by Lil Glock 420 ’s rage-beat anthem “ FASHION ” (48.9K+ creations), a warped version of David and Goliath is making its rounds throughout the platform. Creators are displaying themselves throwing an object at someone or something in slo-mo. Whether it be tossing a roll of tape at a friend or tossing a ball at a dog , they immediately regret their decision as the target of their frustration grows into a monstrous size on the screen. Lil Glock 420 has been actively engaging with the song on his own account, sharing a clip of the official video and thanking fans for helping the song reach 2M Spotify streams, reposting some of his favorite creations with the sound , and sharing his reaction to “FASHION” trending on TikTok . Before he was recognized as one of the only Canadian creators on the 2022 Black TikTok Trailblazers List , Toronto creator Akintoye made a splash on TikTok with his off-the-cuff freestyles, such as “ I’m Broke ” (21.3K+ creations) and a freestyle about the COVID-19 vaccine (19.3M+ views). Previously released as a snippet on his page, Akintoye’s “ Pizzazz ” inspires creators to share their mental health checks in a lighthearted way. Using his emphatic lyrics, “Are you okay, like really?/I’m fine, if I’m going to be sad I’m gonna do it with pizzazz,” creators find a silver lining in their sadness by showing the ways they cope with “pizzazz”: playing video games , dying their hair , and giving themselves new tattoos . Akintoye has also interacted with his song on TikTok , showing his 2.5M followers how he deals with sadness by binge-watching anime. “Pizzazz” has more than 125k video creations to date, and its TikTok success helped the song rack over 500k streams on Spotify alone. With his off-the-wall lyricism and rapidfire toasting style, Dancehall deejay Yung Bredda has a TikTok hit on his hands with “ Rockin Chair ” (42.5k creations). The song’s minimalist percussion and emphatic, NSFW lyrics make it the perfect soundtrack for a new trend used by creators who feel like they can’t be stopped . When faced with the song’s irresistible breakdown, creators face away from the camera and practice their most untouchable strut , walking headfirst with the belief that their irrational confidence will help them navigate sticky situations, from tricking a significant other’s protective brother to delivering a white lie to mistaking someone else’s car for your own .

The sinister slice of street music finds a charged up Slimelife attacking a frenetic trap instrumental, courtesy of Hocus , Vaze , and Ellis Lost , with the money-motivated urgency of an ATL hustler. The Diesel Filmz -directed, Jay Kastle -edited “Big Biznezz” video sees the Alamo Records signee creeping through corridors, studios, and the nighttime streets of Atlanta, while he keeps his hands full with the stick or a stack. Rocking an iced-out OTF chain, which he received from his mentor Lil Durk , Slimelife reflects on the life before the money and the grind required to count it up like he does now, rapping, “Used to rock the backseat, now I rock this jewelry now/Used to talk but that’s cheap, they pay me for my service now.” “Big Biznezz” arrives as Slimelife’s first release since his October 2021 album, Better Living . Executive- produced by Lil Durk, <em is a deeply sincere document from one of Atlanta’s most promising young rappers, offering head-knocking bangers and heartfelt ballads in equal measure. The new full-length is home to several popular singles that tore up ATL in 2021 including “ Suit Me Up ,” with a guest appearance from Lil Durk, and street-successful singles like the powerful “ Slatt Bizness ” (3.5 million YouTube views), the determined “ Baby Boy ” (3.8 million views), and the triumphant “ No Brakes ” (3.5 million views).

In 2021, Trapland Pat dropped his latest project, Thru Da Door , via Bang Biz, featuring collaborations with Kuttem Reese and Members Only rapper Kid Trunks. He’s still pushing his latest single, ‘Boondocks,”‘which dropped last month. However, on Instagram, Pat celebrated the anniversary of his song ‘Big Business’ and teased a potential remix coming later this year.” – Miami New Times “Over the course of the last few weeks perhaps no one else has hit the scene as hard as Pat…The Florida rapper raps with wide-eyed astonishment, seemingly at his own bars sometimes which become as animated as his facial expressions. To be honest, the sheer confidence Trapland Pat employs on the track here just makes you want to pay attention or risk missing out on something.” – ELEVATOR The Video: With the versatility to set a vibe on any instrumental, Trapland Pat is an artist for all occasions. Trading in his eye-popping intensity for a head-bopping change of pace, the Broward County native returns to set the groove in his new single, “ Trap Dance ,” the latest glimpse from his upcoming project, Trapnificent , coming soon via Alamo/Bang Biz . The ShotByJolo -directed “Trap Dance” video sees Trapland Pat boogieing with some baddies in the backyard of the traphouse and stomping through the streets with the homies, proudly repping his Haitian heritage every step of the way. As Pat two-steps his way to “two mamacitas” that catch his attention, he pauses for a word of caution, rapping, “I’m been takin’ care my people, you best believe they doin’ fine/How your face so clean in a city full of crime.” Raised in a strict Haitian household in Deerfield Beach, FL, Trapland Pat took it upon himself to escape his rough circumstances by any means necessary. When his football dreams came crashing to a halt after his scholarship to Indiana State was revoked, Pat threw himself into rap music. Inspired by his brother’s habit of freestyling, Pat realized he had serious talent, and spent his spare time refining his wordplay and songwriting. He made a name for himself in the south with mixtapes like Exit 41 and Pak Man , eventually earning the attention of Fredo Bang , who signed him to his Bang Biz imprint, in partnership with Alamo Records . 2021 was a huge year for the young rapper, heralded by his single “ Big Business .” Dominated by a simple, but infectious piano riff, “Big Business” showcased the rapper’s rare charisma, generating over 5 million combined streams and earning praise from Passion of the Weiss , who recently placed the song at #18 on its list of Best Rap Songs of 2021 . “Big Business” was the centerpiece of the Pitchfork -acclaimed Thru The Door , an accomplished 13-track mixtape with appearances from fellow Floridians Kid Trunks and Kuttem Reese . As Trapland Pat looks to take his searing street raps to a much larger audience, stay tuned for much more music from the young rapper, and don’t dare doubt his determination to succeed.

About Ari Lennox: There’s something undeniably profound about great voices. From the beginning, talented singers and their melodic gifts have served as soundtracks to our lives. Dreamville’s Ari Lennox is no different. The D.C.-born singer-songwriter experienced an incredible 2019, complete with her debut album, Shea Butter Baby . The video for the duly titled platinum single, “Shea Butter Baby,” alongside label head and marquee artist, J. Cole, has surpassed 50million views on YouTube alone. Surpassing 1 billion global streams, Shea Butter Baby also spawned the singles “Up Late” and “BMO,” which Ari performed on Jimmy Fallon in June 2019. The intimate video for “Up Late” received nods from several major outlets, including ESSENCE, Noisey, Pitchfork, and Billboard. Ari supported the album by headlining her sold-out Shea Butter Baby Tour before joining Lizzo’s Cuz I Love You Too Tour. Ari has been a frequent name on the awards circuit, receiving a Grammy nomination for her contribution on Dreamville’s album, Revenge of the Dreamers III . Ari was nominated for three 2019 Soul Train Awards, two 2020 NAACP Awards. The singer/songwriter returned with her fresh new single, “Pressure,” produced by an all-star cast of Jermaine Dupri, Bryan Michael Cox and Johnta Austin. The Chandler Lass-directed video reached over one million views within 24 hours and is Ari’s first Billboard Hot 100 entry (currently at #66), #1 record at Adult R&B Radio, top 10 at Urban Radio accumulating over 74 million streams. About Mereba: Mereba is a multifaceted artist with the life story of a rolling stone. Her unique blend of r&b, folk, and hip hop makes space for a new voice found in this wise young storyteller. She released her groundbreaking debut album, The Jungle Is the Only Way Out , in February 2019 and featured appearances from 6LACK and J.I.D. The acclaimed project earned praise from Vogue, Pitchfork, Billboard, Earmilk, Hypebeast, and Ones to Watch, who noted that “Mereba has pushed the boundaries of R&B and established herself as a voice of the future.” She also appeared on Dreamville’s now-platinum Revenge of the Dreamers III in 2019, which earned her her first Grammy nomination in 2020, and on Spilligion , the 2020 album by the Atlanta-based Spillage Village collective.

Jetting from the swampy Southeast to the Pacific Northwest, J Billz shares “Fresh Off The Plane ,” his new video single. Nimbly navigating Pi’erre’s fuguing keys and thumping low end with his bouncy drawl, the SOSSHOUSE artist unfurls an unceasing smack talk assault, flaunting his IDGAF attitude in his pursuit of the bag: “B*tch, I’m Ruth’s Chris in my city, n**** I go anywhere/Bout to come to your lil city, them b*tches want my underwear.” In the video, directed by NoahSoCold , J Billz goes super sonic in Seattle, doing his dance under the shadow of the Space Needle with chaotic charisma. “Fresh Off The Plane” is the latest quality video from the rising artist, directly following February’s “ Everywhere We Go .” Produced by Pi’erre Bourne, who crafts a trap symphony with snickering synths, scampering pizzicato strings, whimsical pianos, and trampoline 808s , “Everywhere We Go” found J Billz critical acclaim from sources like The FADER . Handpicked by Pi’erre Bourne for his SOSSHOUSE label, J Billz is determined to speed out of Spartanburg and race to the top of the rap game.

Key Glock Paper Route Empire’s Kenny Muney and Key Glock Unite to Ignite Parasites in Latest Video from the Time Is Muney Mixtape Critical Praise: “5 under-the-radar rappers from Memphis you should know about…Kenny Muney stands as the city’s rap emissary.” – The FADER “Laced with familiar southern swagger and street tales, the new project solidifies Kenny has a viable name to keep an eye on as the new year creeps up.” – HotNewHipHop “The South Memphis native has become a master at bodying the braggadocious current Memphis trap sound, while still finding endless ways to make his personal wit and charm stand out on every track.” – Dirty Glove Bastard The Video: With an endless arsenal of bars, rooted in the South Memphis struggle and spit through steadily explosive triplet flows, Kenny Muney has emerged as a pillar of the Grind City scene. Teaming with his fellow Paper Route Empire signee Key Glock , who delivers a standout verse, Kenny returns to share his new video for “ Leeches .” On the track from his recent Time Is Muney mixtape, Kenny delivers a ceaseless salvo of slick punchlines laced with the side-eyed awareness of the snakes that surround him, as Kenny raps, “N***** do anything for a bankroll/B****** be chasing the end of the rainbow/These b***** know Kenny Muney got big racks/These b****** know I got juice like a mango.” The “Leeches” video opens with Kenny and Glock conducting Paper Route business at their kitchen table executive office with an associate. As Kenny passes the workday shooting a fat stack of cash into the trash bin across the room like Kobe, Key Glock follows with his Kareem Abdul-Jabar skyhook. When the associate goes to fetch Glock’s rebound, things get sticky when Glock notices the rack he clipped from the table hanging from the man’s back pocket. The duo throws the spineless thief to the ground and kick him to the curb, showing they won’t hesitate to throw salt on any and all “Leeches.” The new video features a cameo appearance from Kenny and Glock’s PRE associate Big Moochie Grape . Released in February, Time Is Muney is an album suited for headphones–the better to be mesmerized by Kenny’s hypnotic flows. Over 15 tracks, Kenny Muney bolsters his braggadocio as he locks his flows onto each booming instrumental with a heat-seeking missile’s precision. The tape is home to recent singles like “ Backend Freestyle ,” a flex heavy track that allowed Muney to reintroduce himself to fans, both new and old, and “ Worthless ,” which received a tequila-fueled music video. Time Is Muney features guest appearances from Kenny’s PRE associates Big Moochie Grape and Key Glock, and a guest spot from Dreezy on the romantic “ Nobody .” Time Is Muney is available everywhere via Paper Route Empire. In the run up to Time Is Muney, the follow-up to 2019’s Muney Talk , the Paper Route Empire signee kept himself busy by releasing multiple singles, including “ Lowkey ,” “ For Kenny ,” “ Long Time Coming ,” and “ Poppin It .” In July 2021, Paper Route Empire released their first ever compilation mixtape, PAPER ROUTE iLLUMINATi , which heavily featured Young Dolph , Key Glock, and Kenny Muney among other label members. Most recently, Kenny memorialized Dolph with “ Role Model ,” a touching tribute to Dolph which racked up over 1.7 million views on YouTube in its first two weeks, and appears on Time Is Muney , as well as the recent Paper Route Empire Presents: Long Live Dolph mixtape. With Time is Muney , Kenny Muney shows that he has the talent and determination to succeed in the Empire-building business. Stay tuned for more from Kenny Muney and Paper Route Empire.

Background: A native of South Memphis, Kenny Muney grew up idolizing rappers like Lil Wayne, Gucci Mane, and Boosie. He started rapping at age 15, developing his aggressive aesthetic and honing his deeply rhythmic flow. Kenny got his first brush with fame when he released “YTN Freestyle,” which racked up over 2.5 million YouTube views, made him a neighborhood hero, and earned airplay on local radio. He made noise in 2019 with Muney Talk, his first mixtape for PRE. In 2020, Kenny Muney connected with his mentor Young Dolph for “No Regrets,” a highlight track from Dolph’s Rich Slave (Deluxe) album. “I’m never satisfied,” says Kenny Muney. “It’s a gift and a curse.

(Memories Inside Never Die) EP The Video: “There’s a war happening outside of us and within us. A waging war on our mental, emotional and physical being. A constant battle of balance & alignment, light and darkness but yet when we embrace our selves as we are we uncover our true power. Pray for Haiti is a metaphor. It’s a reminder when we are in some of our deepest/darkest moments it takes courage and self-awareness to pull yourself out of any feeling of discomfort or feeling of unworthiness.” – Ace Hood Since reclaiming his independence and setting out on a new path, Ace Hood ’s story is best described as one of spiritual, mental, artistic, and physical growth. Today, Ace returns to transform hearts and minds in revolutionary fashion, sharing the poignant new video for “ At War ,” the standout track of self-discovery amidst social injustice from his recent M.I.N.D. (Memories Inside Never Die) EP, available everywhere via Hood Nation / EMPIRE . The Alex Heider -directed “At War” video depicts a version of Ace in stark contrast to the Broward County turn-up trailblazer of old, as he steps into the role of a revolutionary who shepherds his people onto the righteous path. Enhanced by the expressive movement of dancer Vernisa Allen , the video for “At War” sees a black-clad Ace Hood in a church painted with the stained-glass sunlight of the outside world as he stands before a masked militia of armed men and women. The video, like the track itself, invites listeners to stand with Ace at the intersection of personal and generational trauma, compounded by the ongoing oppression of Black people–in America and in Ace’s ancestral Haiti– throughout history. Facing these seemingly insurmountable obstacles, Ace’s unyielding introspection, ceaseless faith, and remarkable commitment to righteousness comprise the arsenal of weapons that ultimately triumph over his adversity, allowing him to lead the way for others, rapping, “If I’m not aligning with my purpose, I’m not truly happy/I get this s*** here from a source and you can’t mirror match it/Ain’t nothing realer than me healing up this mental damage.” Featuring recent singles like the boldly aspirational, “ Glory ,” and the glowingly self-assured, “ Little Light ,” M.I.N.D. marked a fresh, new start for Ace. Enlisting fellow independent veteran and outspoken activist Killer Mike for the project’s sole feature, the project is animated by a clear social message that dissects the mentality required to triumph over personal and generational trauma. Whether he’s celebrating the spoils of his hard-earned self-sovereignty as an artist on tracks like “ Living Legend ,” or grappling with long-standing structures which serve to deny him that autonomy as a black man on songs like “ Free ,” M.I.N.D. serves as Ace’s testament to the universal truths found only by looking inward. “Knowledge is power,” asserts Ace Hood. “The key is to work together to further each other. I speak on a human level because at some point I, or a loved one, have been affected by the issues I speak about in my rhymes. I believe people need a fearless representation of what these issues look like.” Stay tuned for much more music and mindfulness from Ace Hood in 2022.

The Background: Amid a career highlighted by gold and platinum plaques, Top 10 albums, and A-list collaborations, Ace Hood solidified his legend as the first rapper from Broward County, FL, to reach national prominence, paving the way for artists like Kodak Black, YNW Melly (about whom Ace Hood narrated a podcast with Complex and Spotify), and more. This new path was not easily forged for Ace, who made immense personal sacrifices to invest in himself while reinventing his artistry. Ace’s journey to inhabit his new self began with his physical and mental health–he devoted himself to training (he started a supplement brand called Ace Blend to help people realize their gains), meditation, family time, and self-love. Though there were some bumps on his road to self-reliance, Ace always knew he was on the right track. “I am in a space where I’m creating the best music of my life,” says Ace. The success of his 2020 album, Mr. Hood, and its hit single, “We Ball” (75 million streams), have proven that statement, and this year, he’s on a mission to sustain, even grow, his independent empire.

Now, TikTok is taking the next step, producing its own musical… about itself!

The song’s wistfully nostalgic, yet somehow still feel-good vibe has struck a nerve with the community, who have created over 650k videos with the sound. The immensely catchy “As It Was” proves to be the perfect soundtrack to living your best life in the big city , inventive green screen-assisted dancing , proud plant dads displaying their greenery , elaborate bathroom choreography , and much more. Though there’s no specific trend associated with the song (yet), “As It Was” demonstrates the breadth and variety of creative responses that folks on TikTok have to their favorite new songs. Atlanta rapper Latto is sitting two spots behind Harry on the Billboard Hot 100 with her song “ Big Energy ” and its recent remix with Mariah Carey . With over 150k video creations on multiple sounds , “Big Energy” is a hit on TikTok too, buoyed by Latto’s Halle Berry-assisted promotion of the song on her own page, and a post from Mariah about the remix that scored over 5 million views. Beyond “Big Energy,” Latto is emerging as one of TikTok’s favorite rappers, engaging with trends , mugging for the camera , and sharing highlights from her career (including a recent Fallon performance ) for her 5+ million fans. Lately, Latto has been focusing on her 777 album highlight “ It’s Givin ,” possibly her next hit to explode on the platform. Since joining TikTok last month to announce the release of his final album Legendaddy , a Daddy Yankee renaissance has risen on the platform. The Latin music legend is making major waves on the app, with both his 2005 hit “ Rompe ” and 2022 hit “ BOMBÓN ” (685.6K+ creations) ft. Lil Jon & El Alfa sparking viral dance challenges. With over 394.3K+ creations combined between two sounds , the reggaeton classic “Rompe” has inspired a sensual dance challenge . Meanwhile, “BOMBÓN” has kicked off a lively dance challenge of its own, started by two brothers @hermanosleon2667 , helping the song amass over 700K+ total creations combined between two sounds . “BOMBÓN” is perfect for creators who want to try some new dance moves at the beach , by the pool , and at home with their cute babies . Daddy Yankee has even taken to the sound on his own account to share behind-the-scenes footage of the “BOMBÓN” video shoot . Throwback R&B hits consistently find a way to thrive again on TikTok–just ask Mint Condition or Bell Biv Devoe. This rings true again this week, with R&B trio Guy ’s 1988 track “ I Like ” (275.3K+ creations) rising on the platform thanks to a catchy dance trend , started by creator @elidadonn . The track’s sultry, yet funky opening inspires creators to show off their smoothest moves at the gas station , with their teammates after a basketball game , and with their friends at prom . Many celebrities and TikTok favorites such as Lizzo , Skai Jackson , and Shenseea are putting their best foot forward and participating in the trend. Renowned songwriter, and original member of Guy, Teddy Riley even joined TikTok to show appreciation to the creator for starting the dance trend and to let everyone know that he’ll be duetting some of the best #ILikeChallenge creations as a “thank you” for all the immense support the TikTok community is showing the song and the group. Drill music thrives on TikTok, partially for the exhilarating sonics, but also because both TikTok and drill music find innovative ways to breathe new life into nostalgic hits. Previewing a snippet of his new single “ In My Head ” on his TikTok page in March, Lil Tjay encouraged his fans to make 10K videos to the snippet before he officially released it. Tjay’s drill makeover of Iyaz’s 2009 hit “Replay” generated 59K+ videos before the release and 159K+ to date, inspiring creators to show off their songwriting skills in open verse challenges , soundtrack a one-on-one game of basketball with their significant other , and document their hair care routine . Lil Tjay also shared a couple of videos using the sound on his page, highlighting his favorite creator verses , inducing vertigo while documenting a trip to Dubai , and sharing a clip of him performing the song at a show for the first time . Lil Tjay’s TikTok strategy paid off big time–the song garnered over 100k pre-orders and over 20 million Spotify streams en route to a #33 debut on this week’s Billboard Hot 100. The TikTok community is always eager to hear snippets of unreleased music. Rising artist Leah Kate is seeing success with “ 10 Things I Hate About You .” After she shared a snippet of the song on her TikTok page in March, Leah wrote the catchy pop track as a dedication to the things she hates about her ex. The emphatic countdown of dislikes in the song’s lyrics resonates with creators who share the ten things they dislike about their exes , imagine themselves hearing their daughters breaking up with future ex-boyfriends , and list their pet peeves . Leah Kate also interacted with her song, sharing videos of her hearing it on the radio for the first time and singing it while riding with her tour bus driver . The ‘90s was a golden era for House Music, filling dancefloors across the globe with dramatic vocals, thumping 4/4 beats, and immaculate vibes. Inspired by his love for that era, producer Never Dull created a seamless mashup of two timeless classics: “ Gypsy Woman ” by Crystal Waters and “ The Bomb! (These Sounds Fall into My Mind) ” by The Bucketheads . Never Dull posted the mashup , entitled “ Gypsy In My Mind ,” on March 26th, and since then, the song has taken off, generating over 169k creations in the past few weeks. “Gypsy In My Mind” is the sound behind a colorful new trend, in which creators use TikTok’s Rotoscope filter to transform themselves into dancing cartoons (the cartoons look cool, but will not dance for you ). The trend perfectly suits celebrations of all kinds, from successful schoolyard matchmaking , to gratitude for a dream job , to picking the ideal place to live . “Gypsy In My Mind” even makes for a good time without the rotoscope filter . Few people seem to be as excited about the trend as Never Dull himself, as he’s fired up the Rotoscope filter to respect the power of a club DJ and make fun of his dog’s begging habits . The European Broadcasting Union, organizers of the Eurovision Song Contest , has announced it has selected TikTok as its “Official Entertainment Partner” for the 66th edition of the event in May. Hosted in the Italian city of Turin, with ‘The Sound of Beauty’ as its theme, for the first time TikTok’s global community of one billion will be at the heart of the event. Both the Semi-Final shows and the Grand Final itself will be streamed on TikTok via the Eurovision account, in a unique new vertical format that combines the official broadcast with a view into the contest’s backstage, while the performances are going on. The TikTok community will also have access to backstage content from all the participating artists’ first rehearsals, exclusively on TikTok. Eurovison’s TikTok account will feature exclusive content every day throughout the contest, including a daily highlights video as well as behind the scenes action as the contest takes over Turin. Dedicated national programming for TikTok fans will be unveiled in the coming weeks. The hashtag #Eurovision2022 is now live for TikTok and Eurovision fans around the world to showcase their creativity and celebrate the joy of the world’s biggest and most loved song contest.

Giving DONNY the day off, DC offers RAG3 KIDD his spot in the limelight amidst their battle for supremacy, sharing his new 713bran -directed and edited video for “ i want you <3 ” from his recent album, My Own Worst Enemy , available everywhere now via Rostrum Records . Floating over layers of bubbly synth and booming bass production, courtesy of Trademark , KillMxtt , and XoBenny , “i want you <3” sees RAG3 KIDD flaunting his melodic flows as he comes to grips with the one he truly desires, and all that he hopes to leave behind. After he was seemingly murdered at the hands of DONNY in the video for “ Live From The Gutta! ” RAG3 KIDD is seen wandering aimlessly through dirt roads and alleyways before arriving at a sunny, seaside paradise. Whether this setting is a brief escape from his conflict from DONNY, or a permanent resting place for the sensitive side of DC’s split personality, it doesn’t stop the young artist from flexing: “Ten pointer diamonds in both of my ears, where I’m from/We don’t call ‘em earrings, I got boogers.” My Own Worst Enemy tells a loose narrative about DC’s inner conflict, which manifests as a battle between two distinct personalities: RAG3 KIDD, who represents the artist’s more wholesome and romantic side, and DONNY, a demonic, red-haired spitter who emerges on the album’s harder-edged beats. The album kicks off in DONNY mode, featuring some of DC’s hardest tracks to date, including the massive “ ENEMIES ,” with a beat that sounds like a malfunctioning supercomputer, and the devilish “ MAKAVELI ,” a fiery lyrical exercise. As the tracklist progresses, RAG3 KIDD makes his presence felt, emoting over candy-coated production on pop culture-referencing tracks like “ iCarly :/ ,” “ Scott Pilgrim ,” and “ Futurama 2099 .” Blending elements of rap, pop-punk, hyperpop, and more, My Own Worst Enemy both expands and refines DC’s sound, allowing the 22-year-old rapper to showcase every facet of his wide-ranging vocal ability. With production by heavy-hitters like JetsonMade , Starboy , Supah Mario , Trademark Charlie Heat , Astroboy , and more, who deliver DC some of their most adventurous beats, MOW3 percolates with the energy of a young artist testing the limits of what he’s capable of accomplishing–and having fun while doing it. Stay tuned for more from the young artist, including the upcoming East Coast leg of his “ MOW3 TOUR ,” kicking off later this month in Philadelphia!

In 2016, at the age of 16 and standing 6’7”, DC moved to Los Angeles to pursue a basketball career under Lavar Ball and alongside teammate LaMelo Ball. During this time, he fell in love with music and used his spare time to make experimental records which suddenly gained traction – As the public became increasingly aware of DC The Don’s talent for rapping, NBA player Lonzo Ball featured his song “Everything 1k” on the first Big Baller Brand shoe commercial, introducing DC The Don’s music to an even wider audience. DC signed to Rostrum Records in 2020, releasing his debut album Come As You Are on August 7th, generating over 125 million streams across platforms. The artist looks to reach another level with My Own Worst Enemy, his ambitious new album, available everywhere now.

Today, Jay Fizzle returns with more purple than the iced-out Donatello pendant on his chain in his new “ Zaba Freestyle ” video. Over a synth-booming beat that combines bouncy Memphis bass with the 8-bit aesthetic of a Nintendo game, Jay Fizzle attacks the track with a flashy ferocity, rapping, “Got big racks on me, color palette/Water like a scuba diver/Fours up on the Benzo make me sit just like a trucker driver.” “Zaba Freestyle” is the latest release in the run up to Jay Fizzle’s upcoming project, DonnaFizzle , coming soon via Paper Route Empire. “Zaba Freestyle” follows in the wake of “ 4 HOS ,” a showcase for Fizzle’s drawly, double-dipping delivery, and “ LLD ,” a heartfelt tribute to his mentor Young Dolph. Adorned with lush harmonies and a star vocal turn from Ricco Barrino , “Long Live Dolph” finds Jay Fizzle baring his soul, the South Memphis native audibly emotional when he relays his gratitude to his mentor for teaching him everything he knows: “The way I talk, the way I walk, the way I act, the way I dress/The way I do my thing up in the booth, I learned it from the best.” With over 1.4 million views on YouTube, “LLD” is the opening track from Paper Route Empire Presents: Long Live Dolph , a new compilation album from the independent label, which features appearances from nearly every artist on PRE, including Key Glock , Big Moochie Grape , Kenny Muney and more. Long Live Dolph is reflective, but it is also triumphant; Paper Route Empire will continue building on the foundation that Dolph laid. Keep an eye on the young and hungry PRE roster, as nearly every one of them plans to drop plenty of music this year. Already, the year brought Time Is Muney , a new project by Kenny Muney, and Yellow Tape 2 (Deluxe) , an expansion of Key Glock’s Billboard Top 10-charting Yellow Tape 2 . With DonnaFizzle and much more on the way, 2022 is Paper Route Szn.

Songs can trend on TikTok for a multitude of reasons, ranging from a popular remix, to a new dance, to a comedic trend, or an artist-initiated open verse challenge. Other times, songs bubble up due to organic enthusiasm from the app’s eager community of music lovers. Check out how some of this week’s songs grew to trending status: Spring only just started, but the TikTok Community has their sights on an even warmer (or cooler?) time of year. A smash hit in 2015, Demi Lovato ’s breezy “ Cool For The Summer ” resurfaced on TikTok this year, with multiple versions of the song reaching trending status. With over 2.9 million video creations to date, the most popular remix (slightly sped up from the original) first appeared alongside a dance by user @iamhibryda , who choreographed a gyrating motion that has been mimicked by countless users. Inspired by the song’s resurgent success, TikTok DJ @kuyamagik combined “Cool For The Summer” with Ginuwine’s “Pony,” creating a mashup that rivals this year’s trending “Toxic Pony” mashup in popularity. “ Cool For Summer x Pony ” has over 1.6 million video creations, soundtracking evil pranks , frisky pets , and more. The “Cool For The Summer” takeover eventually reached the ears of Demi Lovato themself , who announced last weekend that the sped up “Nightcore” remix would be available to stream on all platforms Rap star and TikTok favorite Jack Harlow is tapping into TikTok’s appreciation for past hits with a new song of his own, one that samples an older hit with a modern twist. He’s begun teasing his upcoming single “ First Class ” which samples Fergie’ s 2006 pop hit “ Glamorous ” and the TikTok community is loving it, driving the sound of the studio clip to over 22K creations ahead of the song’s release. Creators have been using the sound to admit they can’t get the video of Jack out of their head , display their excitement about the song’s upcoming release , and even to share the perfect drink recipe for getting ready for a night out . Along with teasing the song in the clip of him listening to it in the studio, Jack also used the sound on a recent behind-the-scenes clip into his GRAMMYs performance rehearsal with Lil Nas X and renowned celebrity choreographer Sean Bankhead . Jack Harlow’s Fergie flashback is surprisingly not the only trend featuring the contributions of the former Black Eyed Peas singer. This week, creators of the TikTok community are putting their best lip-syncing chops on full display to belt out the lyrics of Fergie ’s 2006 chart-topper, “ Big Girls Don’t Cry ” (501K+ platform and user-generated creations combined). The throwback inspired two trends, as creators invite one another to hold hands using Fergie’s emphatic lyrics, “Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to/’Cause I wanna hold yours too.” Other videos find creators unable to fight the urge to sing the catchy hook, “I hope you know, I hope you know/That this has nothing to do with you…” Whether they’re hilariously interrupting their girlfriend’s nap with their vocals , sharing their personal connection with the song , or simply singing during a solo car ride , these creators use the song to show the world how they are optimistic about healing from their past hardships. Fresh off the release of his Billboard 200 chart-topping album 7220 , Lil Durk is having a major moment on TikTok with his heartfelt track “ What Happened To Virgil ” ft. Gunna . With over 34.7K creations, the song is tugging at the heartstrings of TikTok users, as the title references the passing of iconic fashion designer and entrepreneur Virgil Abloh . The track’s popular lyric “Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?” is inspiring both somber and more lighthearted creations from those who reflect on Virgil’s passing , who can’t believe their former classmates are having children , and who wonder why their friends can’t handle their liquor . Lil Durk and Gunna have both been interacting with the sound on their own accounts, with Durk promising to drop the video for the song once the sound reached 10K creations. The TikTok community is always looking for a boost of serotonin, especially in dark times. Singer Eddie Benjamin echoes the thoughts of creators everywhere who are yearning for brighter days with his new song, “ Weatherman .” Previously previewing a snippet on his TikTok page , the Australian singer emphasizes his desire for a temperature outside that won’t kill his vibe. Boasting over 12K creations and 3 million Spotify streams since its February release, creators use the upbeat pop song to show off their outfit ideas for every season , document their everyday routines, and share their disappointment of the constant rainfall in their cities . Eddie Benjamin has also interacted with his song on his page , promoting it to his 53K followers, and lip synced the song with Maddie Ziegler in a video that generated over 8.7 million views. TikTok has been instrumental in bolstering the popularity of Louisiana smashes like Kevin Gates’ “Thinking With My Dick,” which charted on the Hot 100 this year for the first time since its 2013 release,  and last year’s “Touch Down 2 Cause Hell” by HD4President. In recent weeks, another hit from “The Pelican State” has been bubbling on the platform– “ I Bet U Won’t ,” a 2016 regional hit by Baton Rouge spitter Level and acclaimed New Orleans rapper/producer Mouse On Da Track . The song’s popularity on TikTok (58k video creations) comes from two distinct sources–the first is comedian Famous Amos , whose staggering dance to the song went viral on multiple platforms, who has been reposting creative re-interpretations of the dance on his TikTok. Another comes from Texas teenager @walker_sheppard , who performs elaborate dances to the song with help from his classmates . With over 150 million views on the #ibetyouwont and #ibetyouwontchallenge tags, “I Bet U Won’t” has the goods to be the next Bayou banger to find a wider audience thanks to TikTok. TikTok has been a fertile ground for musical theater, transforming creative experiments like Emily Bear & Abigail Barlow’s GRAMMY-winning The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical and the Ratatouille -adaptation Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical! into full-fledged productions. Now, TikTok is taking the next step, producing its own musical… about itself! The musical, entitled For You, Paige will be performed on a stage in NYC and available to watch LIVE only on TikTok on April 14th. For You, Paige was written by Daniel Mertzlufft , the brains behind the Ratatouille musical, and it tells the story of a young TikTok creator’s journey to viral stardom. Creators Sri , Krystina Alabado , Roman Banks , and James Henry will be among the cast. With more announcements and details to come, For You, Paige will be performed in NYC and streamed LIVE on @tiktok on April 14th at 7pm ET/4pm PT .

Today, Gotit returns to walk us through the wizarding world of Zone 3 with his new single, “ She Know It ,” from his forthcoming project The Cheater , arriving this spring. Anchored by an equally ominous and angelic instrumental courtesy of Boominati Worldwide producer Topp , “She Know It” is Lil Gotit’s unapologetic player anthem. Dripping with all the sonic sensibilities of Atlanta trap that make Gotit a staple of the city, Gotit makes his own waves while showing love to a hometown hero, rapping, “Forgiatos, Moscato, that’s just what I’m on/That money the motto, come f*** with a Don/Thugger Thugger living, ‘So Much Fun.’” In the Jerry Morka -directed video for “She Know It,” Gotit works his magic, connecting with his brother Lil Keed to form the most formidable wizarding duo since Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. Gotit is a Gryffindor prone to kicking doors, as the spellbinding spitter totes his wand through enchanted corridors, casting spells of trap magic to summon side chicks and make opps vanish into thin air. “She Know It” arrives following Gotit’s recent video singles “ Take Care ,” featuring Toosii and Milly Go Lightly , and “ Walk Down ,” featuring CEO Trayle , Biggz , and Lil Double 0 , his first two releases since 2021’s Top Chef Gotit . The Gunna -executive produced Top Chef Gotit marked Gotit’s ascension into the ranks of Atlanta’s trap elite, earning the official co-sign from his slimes like Young Thug . As Gotit plots his next move, he looks to cement his legacy within ATL’s storied tradition and establish himself as the leader of a cresting wave of innovative trap stars. Stay tuned for much more from Lil Gotit in the near future.

Showing no signs of slowing his rolling and controlling, DUSTY returns to share new visuals from his acclaimed debut for the choir-backed Brooklyn drill anthem, “ FLOSS STATE OF MIND .” The “FLOSS STATE OF MIND” video finds DUSTY in a remote island paradise, journeying through the jungle with machete in hand, making waves on a yacht, and building a bonfire on the beach with Wilson, the Castaway co-star who is still the world’s most beloved volleyball. The vibey hometown anthem serves as DUSTY’s invitation to “come take a trip” to Canarsie, also known as “The Flossy,” as he raps, “WOOs do it better, stack your cheddar, get ‘em off me/But you can never say a n**** like me, big cheese/Most n***** talk that hot s*** then go call the police.” Following recent clips like the booming “ BIG WOOS ” (1.5 million views), the Yung Bleu-featuring “ WHAT YOU NEED ” (1.6 million views), and the high-octane “ REWIND ” (2 million views), “FLOSS STATE OF MIND” is the latest video from UNTAMED , which capped off a massive 2021 for the 22-year-old artist. In December, DUSTY joined the exclusive ranks of artists like Olivia Rodrigo , Coi Leray , Pooh Shiesty , and many more, by being welcomed into the #RIAAClassOf2021 for receiving his first GOLD certification this year with his debut single, “ ROLLIN N CONTROLLIN FREESTYLE ,” which racked up over 200 million combined streams. The EMPIRE artist struck gold again with “ Rolando (Caught In The Rain) ” (73 million Spotify streams) and  “ ROLLIN N CONTROLLIN PT. 2 (PICTURE ME) ,” which generated well over 150k video creations on TikTok.

The Background: “It was all in front of me; I just had to go get it,” DUSTY LOCANE says at the beginning of his viral drill heater, “Rolando (Caught In The Rain).” That’s an understatement: less than a year after he started rapping, the gruff-voiced, baby-faced Brooklyn spitter has experienced one of the most meteoric rises in recent rap history. He’s only released three songs, and he’s already a star: his breakout song “R60LLXN N CONTROLLIN” went viral instantly, and its follow-up “Rolando” garnered 1 million video plays and 1 million streams in its first week. The world is closely watching Dusty, and he’s ready to deliver. Links: instagram | twitter | youtube | spotify “FLOSS STATE OF MIND”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK5Irx554sQ “BIG WOOS” ft.

With a street-sharpened pen, Doodie Lo spits Midwest mob tales through his trap-happy rasp on his new video single, “ FACE .” The CROWNSOHEAVY -directed video sees Doodie squad up at the studio, putting his endless hustle on display while he makes it crystal clear he’s only a stone’s throw from the streets, rapping, “I be rapping, but got P’s on the low/You better ease off that snow/‘Fore I sneeze, and they blow.” “FACE” is the latest salvo in a busy year for the Only The Family artist, following his recent Icewear Vezzo -assisted single, “ Melrose ,” as the artist looks to make his mark with his street anthems. Last year, Doodie Lo made an impact with Big Doodie Lo , the artist’s debut full-length project. The mixtape is home to “ Me & Doodie Lo ,” an energetic collab between King Von and Doodie that originally appeared on OTF’s Loyal Bros compilation (and racked up over 10.8 million YouTube views), in which the legendary O-Block native gives Mr. Kankakee an enthusiastic co-sign. Doodie Lo returns the favor with mixtape highlight “Von Flow ,” in which he emulates the propulsive rhyming pattern that Von used in many of his hits and tells a crazy story of his own. Featuring appearances from his OTF head honcho Lil Durk , along with guest spots from Moneybagg Yo , Pooh Shiesty (on the pugilistic recent single “ Bodies ,” which has 2+ million YouTube views), BIG30 , and Yung Mal , Big Doodie Lo is available to stream everywhere via Only The Family / EMPIRE . A close associate of Lil Durk with a growing fanbase in the midwest, Doodie Lo hails from Kankakee, a small city 30 minutes outside of Chicago. He has contributed several standout tracks to OTF compilation tapes, including “Hang Out” ft. Memo600 , from 2019’s Family Over Everything . The artist had his coming out party early in 2021 with his contributions to Loyal Bros , including “ Took Down ,” his collaboration with Memphis rapper BIG30 that racked up over 1.8 million video views, “ Street Raised Me ,” which connected him with Booka600 , and most significantly, the aforementioned “ Me And Doodie Lo .” With the full support of Lil Durk, who Doodie Lo is supporting on “ The 7220 Tour ,” and a strong debut mixtape under his belt, Doodie Lo looks to establish himself as the next midwest street rapper to blow. Given all that he’s already overcome, it would not be wise to bet against him.

The Background: OTF Background Founded by Lil Durk, Only The Family is one of rap’s most respected labels and most impressive collections of talent. Originally based in Chicago, the label earned a reputation for cultivating some of the city’s most vital talents, with members like Booka600, Memo600, and the late great King Von. With a roster that reflects label boss Durk’s signature combination of raw lyricism and emotional songwriting, OTF has released three label compilation mixtapes, including the two volumes of Only The Family Involved in 2018 and Family Over Everything in 2019. Ready to make a statement after a 2020 marked by success and tragedy in equal measure, Only The Family is currently preparing Loyal Bros, their next compilation tape, coming in February 2021.

Composed of rappers Top5ivee , P4K , 5Much , and EKillaOffDaBlocck , each member of the versatile BSG crew brings their own unique strengths to the table, resulting in the most exciting four-man squad since the Ninja Turtles. Today, the Baby Stone Gorillas assemble once again to put the “ice” in “service” with “ Keep Goin ,”  their new video from the group’s debut mixtape, BABYST5XNE GORILLAS . The side-splitting, YourJustNTime -directed “Keep Goin” video opens on a sunny Sunday morning at the house of worship as the impassioned pastor preaches to the “sinners, gangsters, lovers” in attendance. Whether dealing with hard times, as he tells 5Much, or turning up in Vegas, as he tells Top5ivee, his sermon remains the same: “keep going!” Taking the altar to give praise with their performance, the BSG crew vibes with the spirit-sipping worshippers in attendance as they deliver some of their most potent proverbs yet, with 5Much rapping, “Asked Killa, ‘How high is that?’ and he said ‘High as f***’/Sometimes I look up in the sky and I look high up.” The four members of Baby Stone Gorillas have known each other since they were 10-years-old, and were friends far before they dreamed of music stardom. The rappers have distinct styles and roles: 5Much brings a hustler’s mentality and vents about his life, while EK packs the energy. P4K is the proud instigator known for slick-talking raps, while Top5ivee often comes up with B.S.G.’s catchy hooks. Last summer, the group’s self-titled video racked up views in the millions, precipitating a winning streak of viral singles that included the Pitchfork – approved “ Military ,” which earned airplay on Drake’s OVOSound Radio , and “ Untouchable ” ft. RJMrLA , catching the attention of Shaquille O’Neal . With BABYST5XNE GORILLAS , the four South L.A. spitters put on a clinic in street rap rawness. Spanning 23 tracks with nary a dull moment, the tape establishes BSG as the kings of the jungle in SoCal and beyond.

The Background: “You can go and listen to damn near 50 people outta L.A., period, but you’ll notice that we’ve got a different sound,” proclaims Baby Stone Gorillas member EKillaOffDaBlocck. E.K., along with group-mates Top5ivee, P4K, 5Much are creating some of the most original music out of the West Coast. From Baldwin Villages, better known as “The Jungles,” this talented quartet blends elements of their street surroundings with imagination, humor, and a will to stand out. In 2021, videos like their introductory “STL Caps & Jay Hats,” “Baby Stone Gorillas,” and the charged-up “Military” made a powerful impression and garnered several million streams. By the end of 2021, OVORadio played music from Baby Stone Gorillas while Shaq reposted a video. Now, B.S.G. readies a 23-track mixtape that features 1takejay, Bla$ta, Band Gang Lonnie Bands, and Wallie the Sensei. “If we don’t capitalize on this moment right now, there’s no other time,” urges P4K. “That’s how we’re treating it: If we don’t do it now, it’s never.” Links: BSG: instagram | spotify | youtube P4K: instagram 5Much: instagram Top5ivee: instagram EKillaOffDaBlocck: instagram “Keep Goin”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oHhK1qloGU “Start Sumn”: https://youtu.be/xcoO8VtO664 “That’s What You Suppose To Do”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAV6PUUJdH4 BABYST5XNE GORILLAS : https://music.empi.re/babyst5xne “Do It Up” ft.

Only time will tell when we really witness him reach his full potential and it will indeed be a beautiful thing to see.” – REVOLT The Video: More than just a Memphis music mainstay, Paper Route Empire standout Key Glock has movie star ambitions. Released as he heads for an eventful weekend in Vegas, Glock shares “ Grammys ,” a cinematic mini-movie for a highlight from Yellow Tape 2 (Deluxe) . Directed by Nick Mays , the video finds Glock flashing back to his youth, telling two distinct stories about his trap life, centered around his granny’s house in South Memphis. The first story examines Glock’s childhood, as an adolescent Glock dons his bright red Adidas and listens to his Memorex discman as he does dirty work for an OG. The second story depicts Glock as a hard-headed teenager, as he and his friends assert themselves as his neighborhood’s dominant crew with both force and finesse. Through it all, present day Glock roams his old neighborhood in a reflective mood, thinking about how his youthful misadventures prepared him for the limelight better than any classroom ever could. The new video for “Grammys” arrives as Glock prepares to embark on “ SiriusXM Hip Hop Nation Presents: The Yellow Tape Tour ,” his first solo nationwide headlining tour, ten dates of which are already sold out . Spanning 33 dates with shows on both coasts and everywhere in between, the tour promises performances of songs from Glock’s Billboard Top 10 albums Yellow Tape (2020) and Yellow Tape 2 (2021), plus hits from his illustrious catalog. “Grammys” is the opening track from Yellow Tape 2 (Deluxe) , the 24-year-old rapper’s latest release, available everywhere via Paper Route Empire . The new deluxe is an expansion of his acclaimed and popular Yellow Tape 2 , which debuted at #7 on the Billboard 200 chart, #1 on the Independent Albums chart, and #2 on the Top Rap Albums chart in November 2021. Home to ten new tracks, including recent singles like “ Pain Killers ” and “ Play For Keeps ,” the deluxe edition bolsters the introspective candidness of YT2 without losing any of the bass-booming, wordplay-heavy Memphis flavor that Glock perfects. The success of Yellow Tape 2 proved beyond all doubt that Key Glock is a standalone star in the truest sense. With the 20-track project, Glock cracked his first solo entrance into the Top 10 on the Billboard 200, racked up over 70 million streams on Spotify alone, and did it all without a major label or a single guest feature. In January, Glock paid tribute to his cousin, mentor, and friend, Young Dolph , with his potent tribute, “ Proud ,” which earned over 4 million views in its first three days, and received praise from The New York Times , among others. The track was featured on the recent compilation album, Paper Route Empire Presents: Long Live Dolph , where Glock appeared alongside his fellow PRE labelmates, and appears on Yellow Tape 2 (Deluxe) . With Yellow Tape 2 (Deluxe) out now and “The Yellow Tape Tour” about to start, stay tuned to see what new heights Key Glock will reach in 2022.

The hip-hop elite is taking notice.” – The FADER “Elmo Kennedy O’Connor was in pre-school when he became obsessed with the Southern artists of No Limit and Cash Money. Later in life, he would adopt the rap moniker Bones and amass a significant cult following. His gothic lyrical style, allergy to songs longer than two and a half minutes, and lo-fi visual aesthetic have convinced a quarter million people to subscribe to the SoundCloud page of his rap collective, TeamSESH.” – HotNewHipHop The Song: BONES put his stamp on the underground rap scene with his versatility and relentless work ethic. Coming through with his second release of the year, BONES shares “ Silverado ,” a confident new single. The track is characterized by heavy bass beats, laced with a distinctive high-pitched synth sound, as the TeamSESH founder reflects on his untouchable status, rapping “You don’t wanna do that, I’m ruthless / Cut off the top now, we roofless / Chains on my neck make her turn like Judas.” The new track is produced by ghost/\/ghoul , one of the first members to join TeamSESH back in 2011. Unlike most producers on the label, ghost/\/ghoul isn’t a frequent collaborator with BONES–most of the music from ghost/\/ghoul’s extensive discography is purely instrumental, captivating enough to thrill without vocals or rapped verses. In over 10 years in the TeamSESH collective, the two have only collaborated twice, on “ WhiteZombie ”(2012) and “ LastOneThereIsARottenEgg ” (2019), but fans won’t have to wait long for the next one. The two TeamSESH titans plan to release a collaborative project in the coming weeks. 2021 was a remarkably busy year for the prolific BONES, marked by five full-length albums including Scraps , his November collaboration album with TeamSESH producer Lyson , October’s ForbiddenImage (produced by cat soup ), and July’s InLovingMemory , a dark and personal album that featured the single “ WhiteBoyRick ,” which has received over 2.4 million views on YouTube.  In March, BONES released PushingUpDaisies , a full-length collaborative album produced by TeamSESH producer Deergod . Featuring the single “ PopRocks ,” which earned praise from Stereogum , the album thrives on the impeccable chemistry between producer and rapper. Earlier in 2021, BONES shared his BURDEN album and released albums recorded under the moniker surrenderdorothy onto DSPs for the first time ever. If there’s one thing fans know about BONES, it’s that he’s always working on his next project. Stay tuned for much more from the TeamSESH founder in 2022.

The Background: BONES has proven to be one of the most enduring, influential, and creative hip-hop artists to emerge in the early 2010s. The TeamSESH founder has recorded dozens of albums, racking up hundreds of millions of streams and feeding a fanbase that eagerly awaits his every move. Despite remaining fiercely independent and true to his underground roots, his music has permeated the mainstream–in 2015, A$AP Rocky sampled BONES’ song “Dirt” for “Canal St.” (124 million streams), and in recent years, BONES has performed in prime slots at festivals such as Rolling Loud as a member of Seshollowaterboyz (along with Xavier Wülf, Chris Travis, and Eddy Baker).
