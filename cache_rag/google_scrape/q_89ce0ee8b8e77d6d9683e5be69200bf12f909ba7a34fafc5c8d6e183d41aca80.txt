[ 3 ] Haywood was the youngest player to make the USA basketball team at the time. USA Basketball also selected 6 alternates to the U.S. squad; Tom Black of the Goodyear Wingfoots , George Carter of the US Army, Joe Hamilton of Christian College of the Southwest (TX) Junior College , Dan Issel of the University of Kentucky , Rick Mount of Purdue University and Charlie Paulk of Northeastern Oklahoma College . [ 4 ] Notably absent from the squad or the list of alternates were Pete Maravich , who led the NCAA in scoring during his sophomore season at LSU and would go on to set the NCAA career scoring record of 3,667 points, and reigning NCAA Champion and Player of the Year Lew Alcindor , who chose not to try out for the Olympic team in protest at the treatment of African Americans in the United States, stating that he was "trying to point out to the world the futility of winning the gold medal for this country and then coming back to live under oppression." [ 5 ] Some of other NCAA stars, such as Elvin Hayes , Wes Unseld , Bob Lanier and Calvin Murphy , were also absent. As such, the Americans were severely weakened.
