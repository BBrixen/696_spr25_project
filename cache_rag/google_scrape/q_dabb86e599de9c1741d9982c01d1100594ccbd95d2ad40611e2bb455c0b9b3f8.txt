Matt Petit/A.M.P.A.S./Getty Images CNN — Chloé Zhao has made Oscar history. On Sunday, Zhao became the first woman of color and the first woman of Asian descent to earn best director at the Academy Awards . The “Nomadland” director is also only the second woman to win the award. The first was Kathryn Bigelow, who won for “Hurt Locker.” “This is for anyone who has the faith and the courage to hold out to the goodness in themselves and to hold out to the goodness in each other, no matter how difficult it is to do that,” she said in her acceptance speech. “You inspire me to keep going.” This year was the first year ever that two women were nominated for best director. Zhao was joined in the category by Emerald Fennell, the director of “Promising Young Woman.” Zhao’s historic win is, at best, a sign that better times could be on the horizon for a category that’s seen dismal female representation over the years. In the Oscars 93-year history only seven women have been nominated, including Zhao and Fennell. The others were Lina Wertmüller (“Seven Beauties”), Jane Campion (“The Piano”), Sofia Coppola (“Lost in Translation”), Greta Gerwig (“Lady Bird”) and Bigelow. This year was also the first time two Asian directors were nominated in the same year. The other was “Minari’s” Lee Isaac Chung. Zhao’s win was instantly celebrated by other creatives in the industry. “Congratulations Chloé Zhao for Best Director @nomadland,” actress Sandra Oh tweeted . “Yes may we have faith in the goodness in ourselves and others.” Lulu Wang, director of “The Farewell,” added : “She nailed it. The whole thing. Like I said, a class act. Congratulations Chloe Zhao, a most deserving winner. Let’s go!” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Subscribe Sign in My Account Settings Newsletters Topics you follow Sign out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch US Crime + Justice World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2025 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Pro Football College Football Basketball Baseball Soccer Olympics Hockey Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War Watch Live TV CNN Headlines CNN Shorts Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules FlashDocs Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts CNN Underscored Electronics Fashion Beauty Health & Fitness Home Reviews Deals Gifts Travel Outdoors Pets Games Daily Crossword Jumble Crossword Sudoblock Sudoku 5 Things Quiz About CNN Subscribe Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Entertainment Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Entertainment Subscribe Sign in My Account Settings Newsletters Topics you follow Sign out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Subscribe Newsletters Transcripts Help Center © 2025 Cable News Network.
