The NFL changes locations each year of which city, the stadium will play the host and in fact book it years in advance. Historically, the location of the Super Bowl has been in warm weather cities if the game is to be played outdoors -- with the exception coming in 2014 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey (which, unless you're a Seahawks fan, was an ugly game to watch). (Photo:  Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images) (Photo: Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images) loading... The other cold-weather¬†cities -- in winter -- usually only host because the team plays in a dome, so unless there's artificial¬†snow or rain or frigid temperatures indoors, that kind of location is safe against the elements. Another Super Bowl fact is that up until 2021, no team had ever played a Super Bowl in their home stadium with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers bucking that trend (see what I did there) at Raymond James Stadium and ended up winning as well topping the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs.

With the cold weather¬†a factor over the years, there have been repeat hosts for Super Bowl Sunday -- be it in a warm-weather¬†city or a dome in a cold-weather¬†city. Here are the Super Bowl locations from SB I in¬†1967¬†through Super Bowl LVII on February 12, 2023, as¬†well as the¬†locations¬†for the next couple of Super Bowls, according to information from Pro-Football Reference, ESPN, and NBC¬†Sports.
