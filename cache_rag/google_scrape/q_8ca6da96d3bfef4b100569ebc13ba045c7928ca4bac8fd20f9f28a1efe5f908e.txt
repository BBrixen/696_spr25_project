Michonne was already gone for around 2 years then to look for Rick. Dead City is set in 2029, 6 years after the main show ended. Daryl Dixon is set in 2023/2024. The Ones Who Live is set in 2019 (5 years after the bridge accident in 2014) until NOW (which we don‘t know yet what that date entails). It could mean 2021, if Michonne found him quite fast, 2023, or even later. I‘m citing this one here: https://walkingdead.fandom.com/wiki/Television_Universe_Timeline My problem with all of this is: Rick and Michonne did definitely not return until 2023. They most likely did not return in 2024. So, when did Daryl return, when did Michonne and Rick return? Not until 2029? Wouldn‘t Rick, Michonne, and Daryl help Maggie get her son back if they were there? No mention of them in any way? I guess it‘s a weird story that no one else (like Carol) is helping anyway, but that‘s another topic entirely. In 2029, Michonne would have been gone for eight years. Eight. I just don‘t how they‘re going to make sense of this timeline unless Rick and Michonne die and just never return. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.
