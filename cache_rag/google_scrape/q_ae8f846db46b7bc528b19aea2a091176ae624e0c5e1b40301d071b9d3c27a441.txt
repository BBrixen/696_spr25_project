Members Online • Rooster_Ties How much longer will iPhone11 be supported under iOS?? (2 yrs? 3 yrs max?)  I just read the iPhone XR is now the oldest ‘supported’ model, and it was released 1 year before the 11. My wife and I both have iPhone 11’s — and they’re great!!  No complaints, really. Before our iPhone 11’s — we each had iPhone 5’s for close to ~7 years. I guess if we get two more years out of these 11’s, that’ll be 7 years too — but it seems like we could easily go 8-9 years with them, based on our experience so far. Read more New to Reddit?
