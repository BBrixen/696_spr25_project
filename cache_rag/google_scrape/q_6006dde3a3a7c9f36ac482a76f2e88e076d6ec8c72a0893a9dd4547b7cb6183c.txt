Members Online • loomer979 *Spoilers* List of discrepancies/retcons with the AC Movie compared to established lore Please help me with any additions/suggestions to this. Mainly looking to just make a fairly comprehensive factual list, and not really commentary on any particular issue. Bleeding Effect - Ancestors from Callum's bloodline actively interact (e.g. shadowboxing with Aguilar) and even converse with him (e.g. his Mother saying "You were never alone Cal" and initiating him into the Brotherhood). Animus - Movie takes place in 2016 but does not acknowledge the fact that for years Abstergo has had technology that allows people to experience another person's genetic memories with just a drop of blood. In other words, there's no reason or explanation for why they need Cal at all beyond taking a sample of his blood. The Apple - I honestly have no idea what the apple in the movie does. It seems to not have any of the mind control / hallucination properties of the other Apples, but instead "contains the genetic memory of man's first disobedience" and can let out some green gas? Not sure what the gas does. The Apple is also spoken of as if it is the only one in existence, and everyone acts as if the Templars/Abstergo have never gotten close to an Apple before. Rikkin - Pronounced "Rye-kin" in the movie instead of "Rick-in". Alan Rikkin - Reports to "The Elders" and not The General of the Cross. Though maybe these are one and the same? [by touloir] Heresy - Movie takes place in late october, Heresy takes place in november/december closer to christmas. Timeline given to Hathaway is before Rikkin leaves for Madrid, presumably for the events of the movie. [by Crowsnevermore] Templar Grand Hall - The Templars having a "grand hall" out in the open in London, adorned with red Templar crosses on the outside for anyone to see is a notable one. The Templars are supposed to be operating in the shadows, with Abstergo as their public front. It makes sense for them to have a meeting place like that, but the blatant Templar imagery makes no sense. [by Taranis-55] AC: Discovery - This game also deals with the Spanish Inquisition, but with Ezio. I haven't played it but my general impression is that it was pretty much completely ignored. Maybe someone who is familiar with it can fill me in. There is also no mention or cameo of Ezio in the film. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.
