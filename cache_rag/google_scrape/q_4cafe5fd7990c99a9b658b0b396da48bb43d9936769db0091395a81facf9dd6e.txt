Early life
[
edit
]
Justine Wilson was born in
Peterborough, Ontario
, and spent most of her early life there. She attended
Queen's University
in
Kingston, Ontario
, and obtained a degree in English literature.
Career
[
edit
]
After college, Wilson moved to Japan, teaching
English as a second language
(ESL). She subsequently settled in California.
[
1
]
Wilson is the author of the
contemporary fantasy
novel
BloodAngel
,
[
5
]
published in 2005 by the
Roc Books
imprint
of
Penguin Books
. Her second book,
Uninvited
, was released in 2007 and is an unrelated work intended for young-adult readers. A sequel to
BloodAngel
,
Lord of Bones
, was released in 2008.
[
6
]
Wilson was one of the first people to use a site like
Pinterest
to plan out a novel.
[
7
]
In a 2007 interview, she identified
Margaret Atwood
,
Joyce Carol Oates
,
Paul Theroux
,
George R.R. Martin
,
Guy Gavriel Kay
, and
Neil Gaiman
as authors to whom she could relate her writings.
[
8
]
She also described her books as cross-genre fiction.
Personal life
[
edit
]
In January 2000, Wilson married
Elon Musk
. Their first child was born in 2002 and died of
sudden infant death syndrome
(SIDS) at the age of 10 weeks.
[
1
]
[
9
]
Through
in vitro fertilization
, she gave birth to twins in 2004 and triplet boys in 2006.
[
10
]
On September 13, 2008, she announced that she and Musk were getting a divorce.
[
11
]
She and Musk shared custody of their children.
[
1
]
Wilson later wrote an article for
Marie Claire
detailing ways she thought the marriage was unhealthy, such as Musk's dismissal of her career ambitions, his description of himself as the "
alpha
" in the relationship, and his pressure for her to become a
trophy wife
.
[
1
]
[
12
]
In 2010, she described herself as a "model former wife", and said she was on good terms with Musk's then-wife,
Talulah Riley
.
[
13
]
[
14
]
She has stated that she kept the last name Musk for the sake of their children.
[
15
]
In 2022, one of their twins officially changed her name to
Vivian
to reflect her
gender identity
and took Wilson as her surname because she no longer wished to be associated with her father.
