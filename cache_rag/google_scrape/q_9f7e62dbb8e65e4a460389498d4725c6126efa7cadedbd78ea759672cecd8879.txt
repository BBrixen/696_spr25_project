Change Log: Fixed Tags nyaheat 07:23 Feb 6th, 2024 Offline this album is incredible after (luckily) stumbling upon a copy for a pretty good price. the first time I listened to this, it didn't sound quite right coming clean through my JBL Flip5 or SONY WH-CH720N headphones (not quality-wise, but feel-wise), yet, the sound felt amazing through my SHARP QT-CD210. Lon Lon Ranch is simply gorgeous, and more Zelda games should embrace a couple, or a few, vocal tracks sprinkled in. HugZombie19 01:17 Apr 25th, 2020 Offline track 4 was... interesting but this whole album sounds really cool it sounds like a semi-futuristic zelda or a mario game Guest Reviewer 01:16 Apr 25th, 2020 Offline I really liked this album. I like the way that the songs have been re-arranged, except for 04 which is an abomination and needs to be destroyed. Guest Reviewer 01:15 Apr 25th, 2020 Offline Hate remixes that make the music sound so bad! Example: Lost woods. That song remixed is TOO TECHNO AND MODERN! Temple of time? It used to be mystical and great, but now it sounds like an unfinished bad MIDI!!!!!!!! Lady Prixy 01:14 Apr 25th, 2020 Offline My review of tracks that intrigue me enough to warrant a review: 04.. WHAT THE LIVING $&#@%?! Since when did Zelda have vocals in the music? Ugh, that one definitely isn't good, in my opinion. 06, not bad. I like it. Very well done, and also quite light and airy, has a very nice sound and is easy to listen to. 07 isn't too bad either, though I definitely prefer the original over this. 09.. I like it. Really brings a new feel to one of the less appreciated tracks, which is nice. 10 Love it! Nothing else to say! 12 is good, though I prefer the original by far. Thanks for reading! Guest Reviewer 01:14 Apr 25th, 2020 Offline I like these remixes a lot, they have a new, unique flavor to them that makes them just as enjoyable as the original ones. I played & finished Ocarina of Time & honestly some of these are more fitting for the game, just my opinion though... Guest Reviewer 01:14 Apr 25th, 2020 Offline I agree that this is a great album, if you're willing to give "rearranging" a try.  Kotake & Koume's Theme is my favorite!  Last Battle & Middle Boss Battle are very well done; incorporating themes we're familiar with but adding a twist.  I didn't care for the Title Theme or Great Fairy's Fountain, but that's just me.  Great work!! Guest Reviewer 01:13 Apr 25th, 2020 Offline This album isn't all that spectacular, except for two songs you shouldn't overlook: Gr eat Fairy's Fountain, and Lon Lon Ranch. Hearing Epona's theme with lyrics is actually pretty awesome. Guest Reviewer 01:13 Apr 25th, 2020 Offline the only thing that i liked changed was great fairys fountain other than 01 the theme of ooc i didnt even recognize it. zelda fans like myself would like to keep some techno out of a middle aged game Guest Reviewer 01:13 Apr 25th, 2020 Offline As a Zelda fan I love this album! The rearrangements were original and super charming. I think they gave the songs a new life. Guest Reviewer 01:13 Apr 25th, 2020 Offline this gives OoT a cool techno twist! good job! Balafenn 01:13 Apr 25th, 2020 Offline We could have Zelda in disco now... As a fan, I can't like this album. Except for Great Fairy's Fountain. Guest Reviewer 01:13 Apr 25th, 2020 Offline I really like the way the songs were redone. It adds a fun twist to every lovable tune. Especially 03. Awesome album Guest Reviewer 01:13 Apr 25th, 2020 Offline This is a great album, honestly. I can't say I like the re-arranged tracks better than the original Ocarina of Time OST, but this has some really good songs. Especially Great Fairy's Fountain. Damienov 01:12 Apr 25th, 2020 Offline Sry man, everything thats awesome about zelda-music like the middleage sounds and stuff like that has been killed in this rearranged version... i only downloaded 01 title theme but it sounded so crapy techno bad that i deleted it immediatly. That would be everything i have to say.
