[ 1 ] Pre-ordering the game granted players Wings of Valor (an aesthetic artifact) and automatic access to Valla the Demon Hunter in Heroes of the Storm . [ 9 ] The game saw release on consoles through the Ultimate Evil Edition . [ 10 ] Development [ ] The origins of Reaper of Souls , in a sense, lie with the immediate aftermath of Diablo III' s launch. After said launch, Team 3 divvied their work into two categories: short-term fixes, which would be implemented through patches; and long-term fixes that would be part of the game's first expansion. The more they assessed, the more they realized that the expansion would essentially make Diablo III a new game. [ 11 ] The design document for Reaper of Souls took form towards the end of 2012. It was a giant Google document that listed the problems of Diablo III , and how said problems could be fixed in the expansion, which they saw as their best opportunity to overhaul the game. [ 12 ] Work had begun on the game by 2013. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Within a year, it was decided that the game would feature a new class, a new area, and a host of features intended to change the feel of Diablo III' s endgame. [ 11 ] Some of the game's new features features, most notably the Paragon changes and Loot 2.0, were added pre-emptively to Diablo III via a pre-expansion patch. [ 15 ] Blizzard sent out surveys to registered Diablo III users for them to rate which new features are most important to them. [ 2 ] Players who don't install Reaper of Souls will be able to play with those who have installed it, but won't be able to access Act V. [ 8 ] Visually, Blizzard intended Reaper of Souls to have a more gothic feel than Diablo III did. [ 16 ] The game was intended to get back to Diablo' s darker roots, where the environment would be darker. To represent this, its art style was primarily blues and grays. The music style was more centralized than its predecessor, in order to make the soundtrack more cohesive. Individual compositions were submitted to soundtrack director Derek Duke , while he arranged them. [ 17 ] The game's soundtrack was composed in 2013 using a symphony orchestra. 19th and 20th century music was used as inspiration for the game's soundtrack. [ 18 ] The game entered beta in China in April, 2015. [ 19 ] In his book The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment , Jason Schreier argued that Reaper of Souls helped Blizzard transition away from PC-exclusivity. [ 20 ] Reception [ ] Reaper of Souls released to positive reception among both fans and critics. Both the console and PC versions were positively received, and reviewers noted that the game felt just as good if not better using a controller as a keyboard and mouse. [ 20 ] Reaper of Souls sold 2.7 million copies within its first week of sale. [ 21 ] As of November 2014, it was the #2 bestselling PC title for 2014 in terms of revenue. [ 22 ] Other game companies took note of the success of Reaper of Souls ; at the time, the games industry was transitioning from one-time releases to live-service (or at least an approximation of) models.
