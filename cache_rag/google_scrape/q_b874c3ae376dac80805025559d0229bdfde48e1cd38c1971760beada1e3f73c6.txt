But here’s something not everyone knows: there are several deleted scenes that few has seen. And what’s even more surprising? Nearly everyone who watches them ends up saying the same thing… Pretty Woman is one of those movies that just gets better with time. And honestly, as I get older, Richard Gere ’s character only seems more classic and charming —and yep, I’m saying that as a straight guy! The movie’s fairy-tale romance and the electric chemistry between Julia Roberts as Vivian and Richard Gere as Edward keep fans hooked, no matter how many times they watch it.

The original screenplay, titled 3,000 , was penned by a then-struggling screenwriter, J.F. Lawton . He was trying to break into the industry with ninja scripts and comedies but wasn’t getting attention. After a shift in focus, he wrote Red Sneakers , a serious script about a one-legged lesbian comedian, which suddenly gained interest. This led to the creation of 3,000 , a darker story about America’s financial struggles and the dangers of exposing the good life to those who haven’t experienced it. In the gritty first version, Kit (Vivian’s wisecracking roommate) was portrayed as a hardened junkie, always on the edge of an overdose, and even Vivian was depicted as a user. The signs of this backstory linger in the movie we know today, with Edward telling Vivian to ”quit fidgeting,” hinting at her past struggles. In the original script , Edward was a James Spader-esque yuppie sociopath, cold and detached, who never once saw Vivian as anything more than a fleeting amusement or a toy to pass the time. By the way, did you know that Disney executives initially wanted Sean Connery and Meg Ryan for the lead roles? Roberts refused the original script Julia Roberts has stated that she would never take on the original 3,000 role, even today. ”I couldn’t do it then, I couldn’t do it now,” Roberts said . ”Thank god it fell apart.” Turning Pretty Woman into a romantic comedy was a brilliant move that allowed it to resonate with a broader audience. Still, while most agree that the producers’ decision to cut the darker scenes was for the best, some fans can’t help but wish for the inclusion of specific deleted moments. The Director’s Cut of the movie enriches the story with additional dialogue and scenes that give more context and depth to the characters’ journeys. One of these moments is an extended version of Edward and Vivian’s first meeting, adding new layers to their initial chemistry. There’s also a tense scene featuring Carlos, the intimidating pimp, chasing after Vivian to collect the money Kit owes him. These scenes didn’t make it into the final cut, but they give a peek into Vivian’s life beyond Edward. Adding them could have made the story feel more balanced and given her character — and the movie — more depth.

Another intriguing moment that many would love to see reinserted into the film shows a slice of Vivian’s life beyond her interactions with Edward, giving the story more symmetry and adding shades of My Fair Lady . I personally love how Pretty Woman turned out in the end. If they had kept the grittier, more “realistic” scenes, I think it would’ve taken away from that magical vibe that makes the movie so special. Fairy tales are meant to be a little polished, a little dreamy, and that’s what works here. The rougher scenes, like the talk outside the club, just didn’t fit the sweet, whimsical tone of the film. Family-friendly makeover In the TV version of Pretty Woman , a couple of iconic lines got a family-friendly makeover! For example, when Kit is cheering up Vivian, instead of her usual “Cinde-f**kin’-rella,” she says “Cinderella.” The scene was re-shot to match her mouth with the new dialogue, not just a re-dub. And that classic line, “50 bucks, Grampa. For 75 the wife can watch”? Well, in the TV version, Kit says, “My grandmother has curtains just like that,” when commenting on the woman’s dress. Horse riding scene As we’ve mentioned, most fans seem happy with how the movie turned out, and it’s clear that only a few wish the deleted scenes had been kept in. However, there is one moment that fans can’t help but wish had made it to the final cut. In this scene, Julia Roberts and Richard Gere share a beautiful moment riding horses together, which would have added a little more color and depth to Vivian’s character and her world. It’s the kind of scene that could have made the fairy tale even more magical. Screenshot / Youtube Speaking of horses, in a deleted scene at the polo match, Elizabeth tells Philip she’s going for a ride with a couple named the Ritters. Ironically, years later, the actress who plays Elizabeth, Amy Yasbeck, would marry actor John Ritter and have a daughter with him. For fans, discovering these hidden gems years later feels like the film is still giving back, reigniting the joy of watching Pretty Woman with fresh eyes. “It’s such a luxury to see these scenes after all these years,” one viewer expressed. “It’s like the movie that just keeps giving,” another said. I never knew these scenes existed – watch them below! So, there you have it — some hidden gems from Pretty Woman that never made it to the big screen! It’s crazy to think about how different the movie could’ve been with those deleted scenes, right? Still, we can’t deny that the final cut gave us the fairy tale we all know and love. But hey, it’s fun to imagine how those moments might’ve changed things. What do you think—should they have kept any of them? Let me know in the comments!
