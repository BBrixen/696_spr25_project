Jack Nicklaus - 6 (1963, 1965, 1966, 1972, 1975, 1986) Tiger Woods - 5 (1997, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2019) Arnold Palmer - 4 (1958, 1960, 1962, 1964) Jimmy Demaret - 3 (1940, 1947, 1950) Sam Snead - 3 (1949, 1952, 1954) Gary Player - 3 (1961, 1974, 1978) Nick Faldo - 3 (1989, 1990, 1996) Phil Mickelson - 3 (2004, 2006, 2010) Ten others have twice won the Masters Tournament. Who is the youngest Masters winner? Tiger Woods became the youngest Masters champion when he won in 1997 at age 21. Who is the oldest Masters winner? Jack Nicklaus became the oldest Masters champion when he won in 1986 at age 46. Who holds the 72-hole scoring record at the Masters? The record is 20-under 268, set by Dustin Johnson at the 2020 Masters, which was postponed until November because of the coronavirus pandemic. Who holds the 18-hole scoring record at the Masters? The record, 9-under 63, is shared by Greg Norman (first round in 1996) and Nick Price (third round in 1986). Has an amateur ever won the Masters? No amateur has ever won the Masters, but a few have come close. In 1947, Frank Stranahan finished T-2, two shots behind winner Jimmy Demaret. In 1954, Billy Joe Patton finished one stroke out of the Sam Snead-Ben Hogan playoff. In 1956, Ken Venturi lead after 18, 36 and 54 holes, but he shot 80 on the final day and finished one shot behind Jack Burke Jr. Has anyone ever won the Masters on their first try? Technically, three players have. Horton Smith won the first Masters in 1934 and then Gene Sarazen won in his first start, in ’35. Since the tournament really got going, however, only one player has done so: Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979.
