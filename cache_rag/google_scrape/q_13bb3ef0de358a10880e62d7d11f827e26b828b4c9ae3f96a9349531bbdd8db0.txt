(Xenoblade, Xenosaga, and Xenogears.) Members Online • [deleted] Xenoblade games development time. Xenoblade Xenoblade X: Proposed to Nintendo in 2010-2011 (following the completion of Xenoblade 1). Discussions about how to realize it went on for around 6 months. Released in Japan on 29 April 2015 and in the rest of the world on 4 December 2015. Updated to version 1.0.1 on 15 July 2015 (the last major update, JP version). Many problems in the development. 4-5 years of development. Xenoblade 1: The initial concept for Xenoblade came to Takahashi in June 2006. The first prototypes of the game began in April 2007. During the course of its development, the story underwent so many revisions that Takahashi forgot all the different ways it has changed. Released on 10 June 2010 in Japan, 19 August 2011 in EU, 1 September 2011 in AUS and 6 April 2012 in NA. Planning for the remake began in December 2017 (just after the release of Xenoblade 2). Presented to Nintendo in May 2018. Released on 29 May 2020. Updated to version 1.1.2 on 8 July 2020. More than 4 years of development (including the remake). Xenoblade 2: Plans for the game began in July 2014, during the latter half of development of Xenoblade X. Presented to Nintendo in September 2014. Torna was the prototype candidate for Xenoblade 2, then they wanted to put it between chapters 7 and 8 of the base game's story, but they opted to keep them separate and put it as DLC in order to expand the scope of the story. Released on 1 December 2017. Updated to version 2.0.2 on 1 December 2018 (the last major update). 4 and a half years of development. Xenoblade 3: The concept was thought between the end of development of Xenoblade 1 (2010) and the beginning of development of Xenoblade 2 (before 2015). Presented to Nintendo in May 2018. Release date set for September 2022. 4-5 years of development. In summary, each Xenoblade had 4-5 years of development. In December 2017 they had 150 employees, in January 2019 they had around 200 and in May 2020 they had around 250. Now they have more than 270 employees. Growth over time. Xenoblade 2 was developed by a staff of just 40 people, without knowing the Nintendo Switch hardware very well and rushed. Xenoblade 3, since the beginning of development, has had a team with more people, they know the hardware perfectly, Nintendo doesn't rush them, they have an improved game engine, the same creators of X1 and X2, and they have more experience. I think Xenoblade 3 will be a good game. X1X2X3X Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
