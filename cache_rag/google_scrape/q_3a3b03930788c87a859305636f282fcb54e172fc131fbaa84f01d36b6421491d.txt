Decraene will spend his 11-month fellowship at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C., where he will apply his extensive classroom knowledge and experiences gained at ETHS to inform federal STEM education program and education policy efforts. The 2020-2021 Einstein Fellows come from K-12 schools across the country and represent diverse teaching backgrounds—with expertise in science, engineering, computer science and mathematics. Federal agencies and U.S. Congressional Offices will benefit from Fellows’ real-world experiences as educators. In return, Einstein Fellows will gain understanding of the role of the Federal Government in the U.S. education enterprise, knowledge of resources available to students and educators, and broader perspectives on national education issues that can be applied to the classroom or to leadership positions in their districts or elsewhere. Visit the U.S. Department of Energy website to learn more about the fellowship program.
