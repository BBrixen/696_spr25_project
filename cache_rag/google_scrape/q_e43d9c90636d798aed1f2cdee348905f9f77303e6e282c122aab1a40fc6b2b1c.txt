[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] This was the first World Twenty20 tournament held in an Asian country, the last three having been held in South Africa, England and the West Indies . Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga had been chosen as the event ambassador of the tournament by ICC. [ 6 ] The format had four groups of three teams in a preliminary round. It was the last edition with 12 teams format before it was expanded to 16 teams. Match fixtures were announced on 21 September 2011 by ICC. [ 3 ] On the same date, the ICC also unveiled the logo of the tournament, named "Modern Spin". [ 7 ] Background [ edit ] The 2012 World Twenty20 is the fourth edition of the Twenty20 tournament. The first was hosted by South Africa in 2007, where India beat Pakistan in a thriller to become Twenty20 champions. Pakistan, the losing finalists in 2007, defeated Sri Lanka in 2009 tournament to become World T20 Champions, held in England. In 2010 England became the third World Twenty20 champions by beating Australia in the West Indies. [ 8 ] Format [ edit ] The format is the same as the 2010 edition . The format has four groups of three in a preliminary round, groups A-D. In addition to the ten test cricket playing nations, there are two associate/affiliate teams who qualified from the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier staged in the United Arab Emirates on 13–14 March 2012. The top two teams from each group A-D proceed to the Super Eight stage of the tournament. The Super Eights consist of two groups 1 & 2. The top two teams from the Super Eight groups play the semi-finals, and the semi-final winners contest the final to determine the world champions in Twenty20 cricket. England are the defending champions, having won the 2010 edition in the West Indies . [ 9 ] The Super Eight stage consists of the top two teams from each group of the group stage. The teams are split into two groups, Groups 1 and 2. Group 1 will consist of the top seed from Groups A and C, and the second seed of groups B and D. Group 2 will consist of the top seed from Groups B and D, and the second seed of groups A and C. The seedings used are those allocated at the start of the tournament and are not affected by group stage results, with the exception of if a non-seeded team knocks out a seeded team, the non-seeded team inherits the seed of the knocked-out team. [ 10 ] During the group stage and Super Eight, points are awarded to the teams as follows: Results Points Win 2 points No result 1 point Loss 0 point In case of a tie (i.e. both teams score exactly the same number of runs at the end of their respective innings), a Super Over decides the winner. This is applicable in all stages of the tournament. [ 11 ] Within each group (both group stage & Super Eight stage), teams are ranked against each other based on the following criteria: [ 12 ] Higher number of points If equal, higher number of wins If still equal, higher net run rate If still equal, lower bowling strike rate If still equal, result of head-to-head meeting.
