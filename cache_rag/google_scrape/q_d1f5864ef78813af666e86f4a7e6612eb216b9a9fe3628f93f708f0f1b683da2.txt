The news was shared after this week’s special Grand Festival event. Nintendo has regularly updated Splatoon 3 with new weapons, Splatfests, and features since its launch on September 9, 2022. Support for the game’s predecessor, Splatoon 2, also lasted for around two years, with its final significant update arriving in July 2019. “After 2 INK-credible years of Splatoon 3, regular updates will come to a close,” reads a message on the official Splatoon X account. “Don’t worry! Splatoween, Frosty Fest, Spring Fest, and Summer Nights will continue with some returning themes! “Updates for weapon adjustments will be released as needed. Big Run, Eggstra Work, and Monthly Challenges will continue for the time being.” Splatoon 3’s Side Order DLC, the new single-player campaign and final piece of content included in the game’s $24.99 / £22.49 Expansion Pass, was released in February of this year. The Splatoon 3 World Championship 2024 and the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe World Championship 2024 were then held in April. They were originally due to take place in January at Nintendo Live 2024, but they had to be rescheduled after the event was cancelled due to safety concerns Source: Videogameschronicle Edited September 17, 2024 by Cpvr Link to comment Share on other sites More sharing options... killamch89 Posted September 19, 2024 killamch89 71,675 Points Members 34.1k Share Posted September 19, 2024 Two years of updates is pretty standard for Nintendo games like Splatoon. I wonder how long they’ll keep the servers running, though, especially for competitive events like Big Run. Link to comment Share on other sites More sharing options...

Right now I'm happy to see Nintendo provide seasonal events. Link to comment Share on other sites More sharing options...

I think Splatoon's success can lead to the creation of more mobile titles. Link to comment Share on other sites More sharing options...
