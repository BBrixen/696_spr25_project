He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 41 weeks, including as the year-end No. 1 in 2016 . Murray won 46 ATP Tour -level singles titles, including three majors at the 2012 US Open , 2013 Wimbledon Championships , and 2016 Wimbledon Championships . He also won two gold medals at the Summer Olympics , the 2016 ATP World Tour Finals , 14 Masters events, and contested a total of eleven major finals. Originally coached by his mother Judy alongside his older brother Jamie , Murray moved to Barcelona at age 15 to train at the Sánchez-Casal Academy. He began his professional career around the time Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal established themselves as the two dominant players in men's tennis. Murray had immediate success on the ATP Tour, making his top 10 debut in 2007 at age 19. By 2010, Murray and Novak Djokovic had joined Federer and Nadal in the Big Four , the group of players who dominated men's tennis for most of the 2010s. Murray initially struggled against the rest of the Big Four, losing his first four major finals (three to Federer and one to Djokovic). He made his breakthrough in 2012 by defeating Federer to win the London Olympics and defeating Djokovic to win the US Open, becoming the first British major singles champion since Virginia Wade in 1977 . He then beat Djokovic to win Wimbledon in 2013, the first home champion at the men's event since Fred Perry in 1936 . Murray had his career-best season in 2016, when he made three major finals, winning Wimbledon. He defended his title at the 2016 Rio Olympics to become the only player, male or female, to win two Olympic gold medals in singles. Murray also became world No. 1 for the first time in 2016, and clinched the year-end No. 1 ranking by winning the Tour Finals title over Djokovic. After 2016, he struggled with a hip injury that required major surgery, and fell out of the top 100 in 2018. Upon his return, Murray won a tour title at the 2019 European Open and rose back to the top 50. He retired from the sport after the 2024 Paris Olympics . Murray was an all-court player who excelled in particular at defence, returning serve and constructing points. He was generally regarded as possessing one of the most consistent two-handed backhands on the ATP Tour. Murray is credited with re-establishing the United Kingdom as a leading force in men's tennis for the first time since the early 20th century. He and his brother led the Great Britain Davis Cup team to a title in 2015 . Murray has been outspoken on issues of equality, and became only the second top-10 player in the history of the ATP Tour to have a female coach when he hired Amélie Mauresmo in 2014. Shortly following his playing career, Murray took up a coaching partnership with his former rival Djokovic for the 2025 Australian Open . Early and personal life [ edit ] Andy Murray was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the son of Judy Murray ( née Erskine ) and William Murray. [ 4 ] His maternal grandfather, Roy Erskine , was a professional footballer in the late 1950s. [ 12 ] Murray is a supporter of Hibernian Football Club , one of the teams his grandfather represented, [ 13 ] [ 14 ] and Arsenal Football Club . [ 15 ] Murray began playing tennis at the age of three, when his mother Judy took him to play on the local courts. [ 16 ] He played in his first competitive tournament at age five and by the time he was eight he was competing with adults in the Central District Tennis League. [ 17 ] Murray's elder brother, Jamie , is also a professional tennis player. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Murray grew up in Dunblane and attended Dunblane Primary School . Both he and his brother were present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre , [ 23 ] when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before shooting himself; Murray took cover in a classroom. [ 24 ] Murray says he was too young to understand what was happening and is generally reluctant to talk about it in interviews, [ 25 ] but in his autobiography Hitting Back he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton and his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car. [ 26 ] Murray later attended Dunblane High School . [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Murray's parents split up when he was 10, with the boys living with their father while being mentored in tennis by their mother. [ 29 ] He believes this could be the reason behind his competitive spirit. [ 30 ] At 15, he was asked to train with Rangers Football Club at their School of Excellence, but declined, opting to focus on his tennis career. [ 31 ] He then decided to move to Barcelona, Spain. There he trained on the clay courts of the Sánchez-Casal Academy, coached by Pato Alvarez, and also spent time studying at the Schiller International School . [ 32 ] Murray described this time as "a big sacrifice". [ 28 ] His parents had to pay £40,000 for his 18-month stay. [ 29 ] In Spain, he trained with Emilio Sánchez , former world No. 1 doubles player. [ 28 ] Murray was born with a bipartite patella , a condition in which the kneecap remains as two separate bones instead of fusing together in early childhood. It was not diagnosed until he was aged 16. He has been seen holding his knee due to the pain caused by the condition and has withdrawn from tournaments because of it. [ 33 ] In February 2013, Murray bought Cromlix House hotel near Dunblane for £1.8 million. The hotel had been closed since 2012, [ 34 ] but Murray reopened it in April 2014. [ 35 ] Later that month Murray was awarded the freedom of Stirling and received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Stirling in recognition of his services to tennis. [ 36 ] Murray began dating Kim Sears, daughter of player-turned-coach Nigel Sears , in 2005. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Their engagement was announced in November 2014, [ 38 ] and they married on 11 April 2015 at Dunblane Cathedral . [ 39 ] The couple previously lived in Oxshott , Surrey, [ 1 ] but in 2022, moved to nearby Leatherhead . [ 40 ] The newly constructed house will accommodate their young family, consisting of their son and three daughters; the youngest, a girl, was born in March 2021. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Murray has been repeatedly vocal in his support for women players and coaches. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] He is also a vocal supporter of LGBT+ rights and supports same-sex marriage . [ 48 ] In June 2020, he also lent his support to the Black Lives Matter movement, when he and fellow players took a knee during the Schroders Battle of the Brits exhibition tournament. [ 49 ] [ 50 ] Murray's ranking history chart Junior career [ edit ] Leon Smith , Murray's tennis coach from 11 to 17, [ 32 ] described Murray as "unbelievably competitive", while Murray attributes his abilities to the motivation gained from losing to his older brother Jamie. In 1999 Murray was a champion in the Orange Bowl , an international tournament for junior players, winning in the 12-year-old category. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] In January 2001, Murray participated in the Petits As tournament, an event for players under 14, and it was here that he began his rivalry with Novak Djokovic , beating him 6–0, 6–1 in the quarterfinals. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] In the semis, Murray overcame Mischa Zverev , but lost the final to Russia's Alexandre Krasnoroutskiy . [ 55 ] He then led the British team to victory in the European Winter Cup and won a title in Telford , finishing the season as the No. 2 in the ETA ranking for U14s, only behind Djokovic. [ 54 ] In July 2003, Murray started out on the Challenger and Futures circuit. In his first tournament, he reached the quarter-finals of the Manchester Challenger . [ 56 ] In September, Murray won his first senior title by taking the Glasgow Futures event. [ 57 ] He also reached the semi-finals of the Edinburgh Futures event. [ 58 ] For the first six months of 2004, Murray had a knee injury and could not play. [ 59 ] In July 2004, Murray played a Challenger event in Nottingham , where he lost to future Grand Slam finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the second round. [ 60 ] Murray then went on to win Futures events in Xàtiva [ 61 ] and Rome . [ 62 ] In September 2004, he won the Junior US Open and was selected for the Davis Cup World Group play-off match against Austria later that month; [ 63 ] however, he was not selected to play. Later that year, he won BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year . [ 64 ] As a junior, Murray reached as high as No. 6 in the world in 2003 (and No. 8 in doubles). In the 2004-instated combined rankings, he reached No. 2 in the world.

[ 85 ] At San Jose in February, Murray defeated a top ten player for the first time, Andy Roddick . [ 86 ] Murray went on to win the title, beating No. 11 Lleyton Hewitt .

[ 126 ] [ 127 ] At the Beijing Olympics , Murray suffered one of the worst defeats of his career, losing his first round singles match to No. 77 Yen-hsun Lu of Taiwan in straight sets.

[ 138 ] At Wimbledon, against Stanislas Wawrinka, Murray's fourth round match was the first match to be played entirely under Wimbledon's retractable roof .

[ 446 ] Murray pulled out of the singles event at the 2024 Wimbledon Championships on the day he was supposed to play his first round match against Tomáš Macháč .

[ 454 ] [ 455 ] Djokovic leads 5–1 on clay, 20–8 on hard courts, and Murray leads 2–0 on grass. The two are almost exactly the same age, with Murray being only a week older than Djokovic. They went to training camp together, and Murray won the first match they ever played as teenagers. The pair met 19 times in finals, with Djokovic leading 11–8. [ 454 ] Ten of the finals were at ATP Masters 1000 events, where they are tied at 5–5. They met in seven major finals: The 2011 Australian Open , the 2012 US Open , the 2013 Australian Open , the 2013 Wimbledon Championships , the 2015 Australian Open , the 2016 Australian Open , and the 2016 French Open . Djokovic won in Australia all four times and at the French Open, Murray emerged as the victor at the US Open and Wimbledon. They also played a nearly five-hour-long semifinal match in the 2012 Australian Open , in which Djokovic won 7–5 in the fifth set after Murray led two sets to one. Murray and Djokovic met again in 2012 at the London 2012 Olympic Games , with Murray winning in straight sets. During the final of the 2012 Shanghai Masters , Murray held five championship points in the second set, however Djokovic saved each of them and went on to win the title, ending Murray's 12–match winning streak at the event. The three set matches they played in Rome and Shanghai in 2011 and 2012 respectively were voted the ATP World Tour Match of the Year for each respective season. [ 456 ] [ 457 ] Due to the tight competition between 2008 and 2013, many saw this as the emerging rivalry. [ 458 ] [ 459 ] Djokovic went on to dominate the rivalry after the 2013 Wimbledon final, winning 13 of their last 16 matches. In 2016, Murray suffered his fourth loss (his fifth total) in the final of the Australian Open from Djokovic, followed by another defeat in the French Open final, where Djokovic won his first Roland Garros title and completed the Career Grand Slam. [ 460 ] [ 461 ] Murray and Djokovic met in the final at the year's end final of the ATP World Tour Finals for the first time in their rivalry, where the winner would be granted the year-end No. 1 status.

Murray vs. Federer [ edit ] Murray and Roger Federer met 25 times with Federer leading 14–11. Federer leads 12–10 on hard courts and 2–1 on grass, having never met on clay. They met six times at the Grand Slam tournament level, with Federer leading 5–1. After Federer won the first professional match they played, Murray led the first half of the rivalry, with an 8–5 lead in 2010.

In August 2012, Murray met Federer in the final of the London 2012 Olympics at Wimbledon Centre Court, just four weeks after the 2012 Wimbledon Final , in which Federer had defeated Murray to win his record-tying 7th title at the All-England Club. Murray defeated Federer in straight sets to win the gold medal, denying Federer a Career Golden Slam . In 2013 Murray beat Federer for the first time in a major in the semifinals of the Australian Open , prevailing in five sets after Federer had come back twice from a set down.

Their last meeting took place at the 2015 Cincinnati Masters semifinals, with Federer winning the match in two close sets, recording his fifth consecutive victory over Murray. [ 462 ] Murray vs. Nadal [ edit ] Murray played against Rafael Nadal on 24 occasions starting in 2007 , with Nadal leading 17–7. Nadal leads 7–2 on clay, 3–0 on grass and 7–5 on hard courts. The pair often met at Grand Slam level, with nine out of their 24 meetings coming in the majors, with Nadal leading 7–2 (3–0 at Wimbledon , 2–0 at the French Open , 1–1 at the Australian Open and 1–1 at the US Open ). [ 465 ] Eight of these nine appearances were at the quarterfinal and semifinal level. They never met in a major final, however, Murray leads 3–1 in ATP finals, with Nadal winning at Indian Wells in 2009 [ 466 ] and Murray winning in Rotterdam the same year, [ 467 ] Tokyo [ 468 ] in 2011 , and at Madrid in 2015 . Murray lost three consecutive major semifinals to Nadal in 2011 from the French Open to the US Open . [ 469 ] At the semifinal stage of the 2014 French Open , Nadal triumphed in a dominant straight sets win for the loss of just 6 games. In one of their last meetings, Murray beat Nadal for the first time on clay, and the first time in a Masters 1000 final, at the Madrid Open in 2015. [ 470 ] Murray fell to Nadal in the semifinals of the 2016 Monte Carlo Masters , despite taking the first set. [ 471 ] Three weeks later they met again at the semifinals of the 2016 Madrid Open , with Murray winning. [ 472 ] Murray vs. Wawrinka [ edit ] Murray and Stan Wawrinka played 23 times with Murray leading 13–10. Murray leads 9–4 on hard courts and 3–0 on grass courts while Wawrinka leads 6–1 on clay courts. They also met eight times in the majors, with Wawrinka leading 5–3.

[ 474 ] Wawrinka beat Murray in four sets at the 2010 US Open [ 475 ] and ended Murray's title defence at the 2013 US Open quarterfinals, [ 476 ] but lost as defending champion to Murray in the semifinals of the 2016 French Open . [ 477 ] Playing style [ edit ] At the Boodles Challenge , Stoke Park, June 2012 Murray had an all-court game with an emphasis on defensive baseline play, and in 2009 professional tennis coach Paul Annacone stated that Murray "may be the best counterpuncher on tour today." [ 478 ] [ 479 ] His strengths included groundstrokes with low error rate, the ability to anticipate and react, and his transition from defence to offence with speed, which enabled him to hit winners from defensive positions. Murray also had one of the best two-handed backhands on the tour, [ 480 ] while he primarily used his more passive forehand and a sliced backhand to let opponents play into his defensive game before playing more offensively. [ 481 ] Tim Henman stated in 2013 that Murray may have the best lob in the game. Murray's tactics often involved passive exchanges from the baseline. He was capable of injecting sudden pace into his groundstrokes to surprise his opponents who were used to the slow rally. Murray was one of the top returners in the game, often able to block back fast serves with his excellent reach and ability to anticipate. [ 482 ] Murray is known for having been one of the most intelligent tacticians on the court, often constructing points. [ 483 ] [ 484 ] Other strengths in his game included his drop shot [ 485 ] and net game. [ 486 ] As he played predominantly from the baseline, he usually approached the net to volley when finishing points more quickly. [ 487 ] Murray was most proficient on a fast surface, like grass, where he won eight singles titles including the Wimbledon Championships and the 2012 Olympic Gold Medal , although hard courts were his preferred surface. [ 479 ] He worked hard since 2008 on improving his clay court game, [ 488 ] ultimately winning his first clay titles during 2015 at Munich and Madrid , as well as reaching his first French Open final during 2016. While Murray's serve was a major weapon for him, with his first serve reaching speeds of 130 mph or higher on some occasions and winning him many free points, [ 489 ] it could become inconsistent when hit under pressure, [ 490 ] especially with a more vulnerable and slower second serve. Since the 2011 season, under Ivan Lendl's coaching, Murray played a more offensive game and also worked to improve his second serve, forehand, consistency and mental game which were all crucial to his further success. [ 489 ] [ 491 ] [ 492 ] [ 493 ] Endorsements and equipment [ edit ] In 2009, German manufacturer Adidas and Murray signed a five-year deal worth £10 million. This included wearing their range of tennis shoes. [ 494 ] The contract with Adidas allowed Murray to keep his shirt sleeve sponsors Shiatzy Chen , Royal Bank of Scotland and Highland Spring . Before he was signed by Adidas in late 2009, he wore Fred Perry apparel. [ 495 ] At the end of their contract Adidas decided not to re-sign with Murray, [ 496 ] and he began a four-year partnership with Under Armour in December 2014, [ 497 ] reportedly worth $25 million. [ 498 ] Murray signed with Castore for the 2019 season which Murray called his last deal before announcing his retirement. [ 499 ] [ 500 ] Murray used Head rackets, and appeared in advertisements for the brand. [ 501 ] In the final few months of his career, Murray switched to a Yonex racket. [ 502 ] Coaches [ edit ] Murray's coach has changed through the years: Leon Smith (1998–2004), Pato Álvarez (2003–2005), Mark Petchey (2005–2006), Brad Gilbert (2006–2007), Miles Maclagan (2007–2010), Àlex Corretja (2010–2011), Ivan Lendl (2011–2014, 2016–2017, 2022–2023), Amélie Mauresmo (2014–2016) , Jonas Björkman (2015), [ 503 ] Jamie Delgado (2016–2021). [ 504 ] In 2022 he was briefly coached by Dani Vallverdu ; [ 411 ] Ivan Lendl was his coach from March 2022 until November 2023. [ 505 ] [ 506 ] Charitable work [ edit ] Murray is a founding member of the Malaria No More UK Leadership Council and helped launch the charity in 2009 with David Beckham . [ 507 ] Murray also made a short public service announcement for the charity to help raise awareness and funds. [ 508 ] Murray has also taken part in several charity tennis events, including the Rally for Relief events before the 2011 Australian Open . [ 509 ] In June 2013, Murray teamed up with former British No. 1 Tim Henman for a charity doubles match against Murray's coach and eight-time grand slam champion Ivan Lendl, and No. 6 Tomáš Berdych. The event named Rally Against Cancer was organised to raise money for Royal Marsden Cancer Charity after his best friend and fellow British player Ross Hutchins was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma . [ 510 ] [ 511 ] Following his victory at the tournament, Murray donated his entire prize money pot to the charity. [ 512 ] In June 2014, following the death of Elena Baltacha from liver cancer , Murray featured in an event known as 'Rally for Bally' to raise money for the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity and the Elena Baltacha Academy of Tennis. [ 513 ] [ 514 ] Murray was awarded the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year award for 2014. [ 515 ] Public image [ edit ] National identity [ edit ] A sculpture of Oor Wullie depicted as Andy Murray as part of Oor Wullie's Big Bucket Trail . Murray identifies himself as " Scottish , but also British ". [ 516 ] His national identity has often been commented on by the media. [ 517 ] Much of the discussion about Murray's national identity began before Wimbledon 2006 , when he was quoted as saying he would "support whoever England is playing" at the 2006 World Cup . English ex-tennis player Tim Henman confirmed that the remarks had been made in jest and were only in response to Murray being teased by journalist Des Kelly and Henman about Scotland 's failure to qualify. [ 518 ] Murray initially refused to endorse either side of the debate in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence , citing the abuse he had received after his 2006 World Cup comments. [ 519 ] Just before the referendum, Murray tweeted a message that was considered by the media to be supportive of independence. [ b ] [ 520 ] [ 521 ] [ 522 ] He received online abuse for expressing his opinion, including messages that were described as "vile" by Police Scotland . [ 522 ] A few days after the vote, in which a 55% majority opposed Scottish independence, Murray said that he did not regret stating his view, but that he would concentrate on his tennis career in the future. [ 522 ] Other [ edit ] In 2006, having been given a warning for racket abuse in a match with Kenneth Carlsen , Murray in the post-match interview stated that he and Carlsen had "played like women". [ 523 ] Murray was booed for the remark, but said later that the comment had been intended as a jocular response to what Svetlana Kuznetsova had said at the Hopman Cup . [ 524 ] A few months later, Murray was fined for swearing at the umpire during a Davis Cup doubles rubber. Murray refused to shake hands with the umpire at the end of the match. [ 525 ] In 2007, Murray suggested that tennis had a match-fixing problem, stating that everyone knows it goes on, [ 526 ] in the wake of the investigation surrounding Nikolay Davydenko . [ 527 ] In a 2015 column for the French sports newspaper L'Équipe , Murray criticised what he described as a double standard applied towards Amélie Mauresmo in her role as Murray's coach, highlighting how many observers attributed his poor performances during the early part of her tenure to her appointment, which Murray denied, before pointing out that his previous coaches had not been blamed by the media for other spells of poor form. He also lamented the lack of female coaches in elite tennis, and concluded: "Have I become a feminist? Well, if being a feminist is about fighting so that a woman is treated like a man then yes, I suppose I have". [ 47 ] After BBC host John Inverdale indirectly suggested Murray was the first person to win more than one tennis Olympic gold medal, Murray interjected; "I think Venus and Serena have won about four each." [ 528 ] Murray has also argued that male and female tennis players should receive equal amounts of prize money. [ 529 ] From 2020 to 2021, Murray was critical of the ATP's handling of the Alexander Zverev domestic abuse allegations, and urged the ATP to create a formal domestic abuse policy.
