Easily the best season of the show imo. I thought season 3 was a bit of a step down after how good 1 and 2 were, but this new one blows them out of the water. Everything has gone up in quality. The writing, acting, directing and cinematography are all at an elite level. Emma corrin and Gillian Anderson are brilliant as Diana and Thatcher and they steal every scene they're in. What's really remarkable about this season is how much darker it is than the first 3. I thought the first 3 seasons were very positive towards the royals and really went out of its way to make them look good. But damn, it's knives out this season. All the royals really come off as awful people and some scenes are extraordinarily hard to watch, especially ones where Diana is being put through the emotional grinder. There are parts where you almost sympathize with Margaret fucking thatcher when you see her disdain and spite towards the Crown. This is really one of the best seasons of TV I've seen in a while. Great time to catch up if you haven't started yet. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. New to Reddit?
