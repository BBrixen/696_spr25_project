My thoughts about Spider-Man 2 and why it disappoints after I completed it. Warning! This is full of spoilers. I will go through everything about the game, and I will reveal key details. So, please do not continue reading if you haven't played Spider-Man 2 or if you plan to play it. Let's start with the positives. Kraven the villain is, without a doubt, outstanding. The portrayal by Insomniac Game is near perfect. Given the high bar set by Doc Ock in Spider-Man 1, I was anxious about how they'd follow up. But I was pleasantly surprised. Instead of replicating the type of villain from Spider-Man 1, they introduced a completely distinct character in Spider-Man 2, and that's Kraven. The presentation of the villain is commendable, and I'm entirely sold on Kraven's character arc. His motivations are clear and relatable, even if we might not necessarily agree with them. Interestingly, he seems to be the only villain in both games who achieves his objective. And this is done quite seamlessly. However, my sole gripe, which isn't related to Kraven's character, is that Peter Parker's Spider-Man never truly faces Kraven independently. In their showdown, we combat Kraven while being bonded with the Venom symbiote. I would've appreciated a more traditional face-off where Spider-Man potentially emerges victorious against Kraven. Another standout is Norman Osborn. Even though he doesn't have a gameplay aspect in the game, his character depiction is exceptional, especially compared to Spider-Man 1, where he came across slightly unsympathetic. In Spider-Man 2, what resonates about Norman is his profound role as a father. His primary goal is to find a cure for Harry, ensure his well-being, and guarantee his survival. Another notable positive aspect of Spider-Man 2 is the portrayal of Dr. Curt Connors, also known as the Lizard. What sets this character apart is the depth of his personal struggles. While his introduction in the game is swift, a deeper exploration of Connors' character reveals a complex individual. As players investigate his life and delve into his home, it becomes evident that he grapples with profound troubles on the home front. The game sheds light on his strained family relationships, including separation caused by his transformation into the Lizard. This depiction showcases a character with layers, torn between his identity as Dr. Connors, a genuinely good person, and the uncontrollable force that the Lizard represents. Dr. Connors' story serves as a compelling example of how a character's inner conflicts can add depth to a villain. It underscores the notion that not all villains are inherently evil, but rather individuals thrust into circumstances beyond their control. In the case of Connors, his struggle with the Lizard persona paints a vivid picture of a character torn between his better nature and a monstrous alter ego. It's a testament to the game's ability to craft complex villains that resonate with players. Yet another positive feature is the gameplay. The web-swinging remains as engaging as it was in Spider-Man 1. What truly elevates it this time around is the introduction of the webglide suit. This addition enhances the swinging mechanics, making the entire experience feel smoother and more immersive Insomniac smartly chose to upgrade the gameplay without making drastic changes, which I genuinely appreciate. The combat style has largely remained consistent. Though I did notice the absence of a particular gadget, possibly the web shooter from Spider-Man 1, I don't find this change problematic. They've introduced a few new abilities that ensure the combat feels familiar to Spider-Man 1. It's neither a step back nor a significant leap forward, and I'm glad they refrained from altering a formula that already worked well. While the game offers several engaging sidequests, some felt like unnecessary fillers, and others, despite being good, had questionable execution. A prime example is the Mysterio sidequest, which stands out as one of the best. However, I'm puzzled by Insomniac's choice to tie it exclusively to Miles Morales, given that Mysterio is a long-standing adversary of Peter Parker's Spider-Man. It was particularly jarring to see Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio, find redemption in this quest, a moment I believe should have been witnessed by Peter Parker rather than Miles. Another sidequest that has garnered significant attention centers around a blind woman and a mechanical dog. While some players label it as peculiar and lacking purpose, I find it fitting. Having Spider-Man, or in this case, Miles Morales, investigate a rogue military robot dog, which incidentally belongs to Kraven, aligns well with the game's theme. It's in sync with the 'friendly neighborhood Spider-Man' persona that's so iconic to the character. A different sidequest that has been the topic of many discussions involves Miles Morales as Spider-Man assisting a student in confessing his feelings to his boyfriend. My criticism isn't rooted in the inclusion of a same-sex relationship, which some have pointed out. Instead, I found it perplexing that Spider-Man, with all the responsibilities and crimes to address, would allocate time to help with such a personal matter. The scenario would have been more plausible if it were Miles at school assisting a friend. The premise of Spider-Man getting involved in such an intimate affair felt out of place. Despite my criticisms of certain sidequests, many of them shine through with compelling narratives and gameplay. Notably, the sidequests featuring brief cameos from villains like Chameleon, references to the Kraven lineage, and the involvement of the Flame group leading up to the introduction of the formidable villain Carnage, are all standout moments. These particular quests offer a richness to the game's world, providing players with deeper insights into Spider-Man's extensive rogues' gallery. **The Regression of Spider-Man in Insomniac's Sequel** Spider-Man, the quintessential superhero, has long been a symbol of resilience, intelligence, and unwavering moral fiber. Insomniac Games' initial foray into the Spider-Man universe with "Spider-Man 1" portrayed Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, as a seasoned superhero – a veteran with years of experience under his belt. This Peter Parker was a complex character who had battled numerous villains and faced great personal loss, including the heart-wrenching death of Aunt May. This portrayal resonated with fans who recognized the Spider-Man of yore – a hero who, despite overwhelming odds, always found a way to persevere. However, the sequel, "Spider-Man 2", paints a markedly different picture of Peter Parker. From the outset, this Peter seems to be on a losing streak. He is stripped of his job, reduced to a mere shadow in the mentor-mentee dynamic with Miles Morales, and consistently finds himself in need of saving – not by just Miles, but also other characters like Mary Jane and Wraith. This repeated need for rescue undermines the essence of Spider-Man, particularly when we consider that this is the same Spider-Man who single-handedly defeated a team of six formidable villains in the first game. Adding to the dissonance is the decision to remodel Peter Parker's face to resemble actor Tom Holland. While this aesthetic change might seem trivial, it further detaches the character from the mature, experienced Spider-Man presented in the first game. Instead of seeing the continuation of a hero's journey, players are met with a Peter Parker who feels more like a rookie than a veteran. The shift in characterization is jarring. Where is the Spider-Man who once took on half a dozen villains and emerged victorious? Where is the Peter Parker who, even in the face of personal loss, stood tall and remained the beacon of hope for New York City? "Spider-Man 2" seems to have forgotten this hero's legacy, opting instead for a version of Peter Parker that feels incongruent with his prior depiction. While sequels often provide an opportunity to explore new facets of beloved characters, they also come with the responsibility of maintaining the core essence of those characters. "Spider-Man 2", in its portrayal of Peter Parker, seems to have missed the mark, leaving fans longing for the Spider-Man they once knew. In Spider-Man 2, Miles Morales begins with a promising arc, hinting at a depth and complexity to his character. The early stages suggest he's grappling with vengeance towards Mr. Negative for the death of his father, an arc that could have beautifully portrayed Peter Parker mentoring him about the dangers of vengeance. Peter's own history and the lessons he's learned could have added immense value to Miles' development as Spider-Man. However, as the story unfolds, this potential is squandered. Instead of being portrayed as a young Spider-Man learning the ropes, Miles swiftly ascends to a level that surpasses Peter. It's hard to swallow the idea that someone with a fraction of Peter's experience as Spider-Man could so rapidly outshine him. Furthermore, the game paints Miles as an almost infallible character, with little to no flaws. He consistently saves Peter, never faces significant challenges or defeats, and even bests villains like Venom single-handedly, where Peter fails. The narrative seems to abandon the mentor-apprentice relationship established in earlier games and replaces it with an inverted dynamic. By the game's end, it's Miles giving orders, and Peter seeking direction. Such a drastic change not only feels inconsistent with the characters' histories but also diminishes the rich, layered relationship fans have come to love between Peter and Miles. This portrayal of Miles ultimately feels unbelievable and detracts from the authenticity of his character. There are also other missteps, particularly in the portrayal of Felicia Hardy, a.k.a. Black Cat. In the comic books, Black Cat and Spider-Man share a complex, on-and-off relationship akin to that of Batman and Catwoman. While Spider-Man 1 handled their dynamic well, Spider-Man 2 falls short in this regard. The portrayal of their relationship is nearly nonexistent, as the character who once interacted with Black Cat is replaced by Miles Morales—a decision that leaves me scratching my head. It should have been Peter Parker, Spider-Man himself, coming to her aid. The disappointment doesn't stop there. Black Cat is never portrayed as someone truly in need of assistance, a recurring issue we'll revisit with other female characters in the game. More notably, her newfound romantic relationship with a girlfriend raises questions. While it's worth acknowledging that Black Cat has been depicted as bisexual in the comics, the problem lies in the sudden departure from her traditionally non-settling nature. It's not about her sexual orientation; it's about the incongruity with her established character. What's concerning is not the inclusion of diverse relationships but the mismanagement of Black Cat's character. This switch in focus to Miles Morales, rather than Peter Parker, feels disrespectful to the character of Spider-Man. Black Cat's involvement in a mission, while entertaining from a gameplay perspective, lacks meaningful narrative impact. It could have served as a powerful opportunity for character development and personal stakes. For example, making her the next victim of Kraven could have added a layer of personal revenge for Peter Parker, driving him to confront Kraven with a more significant emotional investment. The handling of Black Cat's character in Spider-Man 2 leaves much to be desired. It's a missed opportunity to explore the complexities of her relationship with Spider-Man and an underutilization of a character with great potential However, there's another aspect of Spider-Man 2 that raises concerns—the portrayal of Mary Jane Watson. In Spider-Man 1, Mary Jane's missions and stealth gameplay were widely criticized by gamers. Many found these segments to be boring, jarring, and disruptive to the overall enjoyment of the game. It was a sentiment so strong that players wanted her removed from the game entirely. While Spider-Man 1 had Mary Jane stay true to her character as a non-superpowered journalist, Spider-Man 2 takes a different route. Instead of addressing the criticism, Insomniac decided to not only include more Mary Jane but also depict her as seemingly capable of feats that defy her established character. In the game, Mary Jane appears to effortlessly neutralize Craven's henchmen, individuals who have received extensive training in hunting and combat, often in jungle environments. Yet, Mary Jane, a regular journalist from New York, inexplicably excels in these situations. It raises questions about the consistency of her character and the narrative's believability. This portrayal of Mary Jane as seemingly adept at everything without proper context is reminiscent of the concept known as a 'Mary Sue' character, where a character exhibits a range of skills and abilities without adequate explanation or development. Another aspect of the Mary Jane storyline in Spider-Man 2 that strains credibility is the argument she has with Peter Parker. Early in the game, Peter loses his job due to his commitment to saving lives as Spider-Man. Meanwhile, Mary Jane expresses concerns about potentially losing her job at the Daily Bugle due to layoffs, despite being an award-winning journalist. It's worth noting that in real life, award-winning journalists seldom face job loss in layoffs. Additionally, Mary Jane appears remarkably young for an award-winning journalist, but for the sake of the game, we'll accept this. The implausibility escalates when Mary Jane decides to write an article titled 'Is Spider-Man a Menace?' in the midst of the chaos caused by Venom's rampage and Kraven's attacks. Despite the city's dire circumstances, including Mary Jane putting herself at risk, one of her primary concern is keeping her job. This behavior deviates significantly from normal human behavior and priorities. The decision to make this article the focal point of the argument between Peter Parker and Mary Jane seems out of touch with the reality of the situation. The portrayal of Mary Jane's actions in the game raises questions about the believability of character motivations and actions. It leaves one wondering if a writer at Insomniac inserted their own perspective into the game, as it departs from what one might expect in such a crisis. Another perplexing aspect of the Mary Jane storyline in Spider-Man 2 is the decision to make her a playable character in the final mission—a choice that received little enthusiasm from players. This mission sees Miles Morales and Spider-Man concocting a plan where Mary Jane, a character not known for her superpowers, is tasked with stealing the meteorite that Venom desires, while they attempt to distract Venom. This scenario raises several implausible elements. First, it's inconsistent with the dynamic between Peter Parker and Mary Jane in the comics, as Peter would never subject her to such a plan unless she willingly put herself in that situation and peter didnt know and then had to either rescue her or be forced to adapt. The strength of their relationship in the comics often stems from Mary Jane's normalcy juxtaposed with Peter's superhero life. In the game, she's inexplicably treated as an equal to two superheroes with powers, a dynamic that defies physical believability and character consistency. Second, the decision to include Mary Jane in this crucial mission, when a character like Norman Osborn, Harry Osborn's father, would have been a more logical choice, is questionable. Norman Osborn's willingness to do anything to save his son from Venom, coupled with his immense wealth and military resources, could have made him a more suitable candidate for the task and believability. The inclusion of Mary Jane in the final mission of Spider-Man 2 is one of several aspects that challenge the believability of the game's narrative and character dynamics, and the missed opportunity to involve Norman Osborn raises questions about the rationale behind this decision The issue with the portrayal of female characters in Spider-Man 2 becomes more evident when examining the lack of flaws or vulnerabilities in their characterization. Mary Jane Watson, as previously discussed, exhibits traits reminiscent of a 'Mary Sue' character, seemingly capable of extraordinary feats without adequate explanation or development. Another example is Yuri Watanabe, who transitions from a normal human detective in Spider-Man 1 to a vigilante with impressive physical abilities in Spider-Man 2. While the game doesn't provide a clear explanation for this transformation, it results in her being able to engage in combat on par with Spider-Man's Peter Parker and even saving him at the end of certain side quests. This portrayal raises questions about the consistency of character abilities and the believability of the narrative. Another character, Hailey, Miles Morales's love interest and a deaf artist, undergoes a transformation that defies realism. While the inclusion of her as a playable character in a side quest is reasonable, the narrative takes a baffling turn when, towards the end of the game, she off-screen defeats five symbiote soldiers. This inexplicable prowess is met with praise from Miles Morales, raising questions about how a deaf human without superpowers could achieve such feats. Additionally, by the end of Spider-Man 2, she becomes a world-renowned artist at the age of 16-17, an achievement that seems implausible without sufficient context or development. In summary, the consistent portrayal of female characters as nearly flawless individuals in Spider-Man 2 detracts from their relatability and raises questions about the realism of their character arcs. The consistent portrayal of nearly flawless female characters in Spider-Man 2 raises concerns about Insomniac Games' ability to craft well-rounded and relatable female characters. It appears that the studio struggles with providing female characters with the depth, complexity, and flaws that make them more authentic and compelling in the context of the game's narrative In conclusion, Spider-Man 2 offers an engaging gameplay experience, particularly in its well-crafted first arc, centered around Kraven. However, the game takes a nosedive with its final Venom arc, leaving me groaning at the inconsistencies in character development and storytelling. It feels as though the two arcs were penned by entirely different writers, creating a disjointed narrative. Additionally, the symbolism of Miles Morales overshadowing Peter Parker in the game's conclusion adds to the frustration for fans who have a deep connection to the original Spider-Man character. The presence of self-insertion by certain individuals at Insomniac Games and a reluctance to address fan criticisms hint at potential challenges for the future of the Spider-Man series. One striking aspect of Insomniac's approach is its hypocrisy. While the game includes LGBTQ+ flags and same-sex side stories as a show of diversity and inclusion, these elements are conspicuously omitted in the Middle East versions of the game, like Saudi Arabia, revealing a disheartening double standard. It appears that these gestures are more about virtue signaling than genuine commitment to diversity, raising questions about the sincerity of their efforts. Overall, while Spider-Man 2 has its moments, it also has its share of disappointments and missed opportunities, leaving fans with mixed feelings about the direction of the franchise. The game's final arc, in particular, leaves much to be desired, and it remains to be seen how the upcoming Spider-Man 3 will address these concerns. Which I will not play. Read more New to Reddit?
