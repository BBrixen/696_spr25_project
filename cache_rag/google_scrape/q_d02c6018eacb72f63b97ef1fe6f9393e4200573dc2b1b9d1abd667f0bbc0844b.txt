Members Online • BKF0308 At what point in the game does Phantom Liberty become available/starts? Discussion Sup I was one of the lucky ones that bought CP77 on pre-sale for my PS4. Tell me about it. Anyway, I wanted to give the game another chance (on my PS5) now that it's apparently fixed and some of the cut content was added back into the game and all, but I'd only want to do it if I get the DLC. Thing is I'd rather get it on sale (probably on Black Friday) than buy it at full price, so I'd have to wait about 10-12 days to see if it gets a discount. However, I'm currently with not many games to play and kinda bored. I'd like to know at what point the DLC starts so that I can start playing the game now and stop right before it begins. You can include spoilers for the base game's story to give me a better sense of where it is. Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
