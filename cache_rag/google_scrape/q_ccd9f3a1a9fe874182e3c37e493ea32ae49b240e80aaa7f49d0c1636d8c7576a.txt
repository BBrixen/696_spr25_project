[ 3 ] Žigart has won the Slovenian National Time Trial Championships four times (2020, 2022–2024), and won the Slovenian National Road Race Championships in 2024. Career [ edit ] In 2020, she won the Slovenian National Time Trial Championships [ 4 ] and competed in the Tour de l'Ardeche and Giro Rosa. [ 5 ] She finished third in the Slovenian National Road Race Championships behind her teammate Urša Pintar and Špela Kern of the Lviv Cycling Team . [ 6 ] In November 2020, Žigart signed a contract for the 2021 season with the Mitchelton–Scott team, later renamed Team BikeExchange .
