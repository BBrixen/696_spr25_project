Members Online • apsted Let's speculate on pixel 6/6 pro pricing? There is no right or wrong answer on the pricing here. you can price the Pixel 6 at $100 and pixel 6 Pro at $150 (with reasons) but let's be reasonable. You can do 2 things either predict what the pricing would be for pixel 6/pro by google or speculated on what the pricing should be in your opinion and mention why you think 6 should be priced that way. let me start. I am reasoning my pricing based on iPhone 12 price. pixel 6 should be priced at $750 or if google wants to be more competitive $700 but I think $750 is more reasonable. Reason: iPhone 12 is  $799 and to compete they need to be lower. people usually ask why should I buy this instead of iPhone when it's the same price? pixel 4a was praised for being cheap and having better spec(except processor) and screen than iPhone SE. pixel 6 pro should be priced at $950 or if google wants to be competitive $900.
