Will Tsitsipas fall out of top 30 Thread starter Thread starter kangaroo1973 Start date Start date Today at 9:59 AM Tsitsipas out of top 30 Yes Votes: 8 44.4% No Votes: 8 44.4% Maybe Votes: 2 11.1% Total voters 18 K kangaroo1973 Semi-Pro Today at 9:59 AM #1 Given his disastrous results ( even lost in QF at his pet masters) I think he will fall out of top 30 by the end of the year. Sure this can age like fine milk. But here are some arguments to support my prediction 1) non existent ROS. He cannot return. This guy s return is something terrible which will be extremely difficult to fix, if at all. Literally everyone is serving high kicker to his BH and there is nothing Citybus can do about it. 2) disastrous BH. In my opinion the worst shot on the tour and the worst 1HBH i ve ever seen. This weird, shaky technique with tons of shanks makes me wanna cry. Cannot flatten the ball out and he is dropping it short. Literally half of his BH shots land inside the service box. Which makes it extremely easy to exploit 3) mentality, for a while I thought that once Djokovic retires, he might have a shot at RG or even AO. Turns out fate had other things at store for him. Sinner became borderline unbeatable on HC and almost everyone inside top 15 can figure him out on clay. On grass he is a non factor. As long as Alcaraz and Sinner live inside his head rent free he is not gonna win a masters let alone slams. 4) daddy . This one is pretty obvious, no need to elaborate any further.

No way he is reaching QF with current form Reactions: dking68 nolefam_2024 Bionic Poster Today at 10:15 AM #6 kangaroo1973 said: He is not bad. He is terrible. Citybus defends QF s in France.

But still huge difference in that and top 30. Reactions: kangaroo1973 K kangaroo1973 Semi-Pro Today at 10:17 AM #7 nolefam_2024 said: Agreed that he is in terrible spot today.

So you almost got it right. And there is one thing I do not understand. Why hire Ivanisevic? He should hire someone who can teach him a proper backhand. Even if he has to completely remodel it and start from the scratch. Edberg, Becker, Ljubicic come to mind Reactions: big ted nolefam_2024 Bionic Poster Today at 10:20 AM #8 kangaroo1973 said: He is like 18th or 19th right now. So you almost got it right.

Most of the coaches are far worse than player and still are capable coaches. Meaning coaching is not same as playing match yourself.

In a couple of years, he'll drop out of the top 100. Reactions: dking68 , big ted , GRASScaraz and 1 other person bobbybob14 Rookie Today at 10:34 AM #10 He will stay in the top 30 this year. Reactions: kangaroo1973 Fabresque Legend Today at 10:44 AM #11 He’ll be in or around the Top 20 by years end. Somewhere from 16-25 or something. It’s really a shame because he’s 26 and should be entering the twilight of his career. Don’t think he was ever the same after that RG Final vs Djokovic.

I think that was a final nail into his coffin RSJfan Hall of Fame Today at 12:11 PM #14 kangaroo1973 said: … the worst 1HBH i ve ever seen.

Today at 12:14 PM #15 Is the poll about falling out of the Top 30 this year or at any point in the future before he retires.  Because it is No for the first case and Yes for the 2nd case in my opinion. RSJfan Hall of Fame Today at 1:15 PM #16 kangaroo1973 said: He tried to bounce back at the beginning of 23 in Australia.

But in 2023, I dunno if Tsitsipas had any chance of beating him to begin with. Score should not have been 3:0 though. Tsitsipas should have won at least a set or 2 , as far as I can remember, his FH was totally off that day Krish0608 G.O.A.T. Today at 1:28 PM #19 His dad is back in his box. So, yes. Yes, he’ll fall and fall. Reactions: dking68 and kangaroo1973 L lim Professional Today at 2:41 PM #20 if beretinni is currently #31 citybus should be able to stay in the top30 by the very least Reactions: dking68 and nolefam_2024 TennisGrandpA Semi-Pro Today at 6:11 PM #21 But but he had a new bh and was unplayable? Reactions: dking68 and messiahrobins M messiahrobins Legend Today at 6:20 PM #22 Not sure about top 30, but top 20 definitely. Tennis is now just a hobby for Stefanos. Good luck to him in life, a good guy, a kind guy who lacked the killer instinct to be a top tennis professional. Reactions: dking68 dking68 G.O.A.T.

If he was able to get a win over his biggest demon CARLOS ALCARAZ, then I would’ve validated the hype Reactions: TennisGrandpA and messiahrobins TennisGrandpA Semi-Pro Today at 7:00 PM #24 Krish0608 said: His dad is back in his box.
