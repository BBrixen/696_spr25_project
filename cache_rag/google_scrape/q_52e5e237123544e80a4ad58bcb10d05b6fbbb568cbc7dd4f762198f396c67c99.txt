D4 is not offline - Console Discussion - Diablo 3 Forums Diablo 3 Forums D4 is not offline Console Discussion EddieLMT-1560 November 12, 2019, 12:13pm 1 https://comicbook.com/gaming/amp/2019/11/11/diablo-4-blizzard-ps4-xbox-pc-switch-offline-mode/ Blizzard has confirmed that the game will not be playable offline, requiring a constant Internet connection. In other words, it’s an always-online game, and according to Blizzard this is because the game features a shared open world. That said, given the portable nature of the Switch, it seems you won’t want to pick up this version if you’re always required to be home or somewhere with a good Internet connection to play it. While [Diablo 4] will require a constant Internet connection, you can play it by yourself in addition to co-op. So, it’s technically a single-player game, but it will require you to stay connected to the Internet so it can produce the game’s shared world. All that said, as you would expect, many fans aren’t happy about the news. While an increasing amount of games require an Internet connection, there’s still many gamers who – for a multitude of reasons – dislike the requirement (So I’m gonna say, saves are online, and if you are a switch fan, this sucks for you guys) 2 Likes homerjnick-2794 November 12, 2019,  1:26pm 2 Eddie…you got a source for this mate?

Soon as I get to a pc I’ll get the link updated with link in first post. 1 Like homerjnick-2794 November 12, 2019,  3:56pm 4 Hmmmmmmmm that link just says D4 will be offline.  Blizzard always talk PC first and naturally it will be offline for PC. I would have loved the quote to have said the always online for all three stated platforms. But I think it will be online only given the shared world.  Like PoE… This means D4 will indeed be much cleaner on consoles than D3. Guess we need to wait more…those quarterly blog posts that were promised will get interesting and they better include console specific information! EddieLMT-1560 November 12, 2019,  3:59pm 5 i know you’re getting old and can’t read very well, but what i posted is what is in the link.   That D4 will be online only… 2 Likes FOMOF-11970 November 12, 2019,  4:08pm 6 Homer has a point. D3 was also an “online-only” game. It is possible when they say it’s online only they are just talking about PC. They have also said that console will have couch coop, so it’s conceivable we will have an offline play mode. It’s not coming to Switch at all based on current information. 1 Like homerjnick-2794 November 12, 2019,  4:30pm 7 FOMOF: Homer has a point. D3 was also an “online-only” game.

EddieLMT-1560 November 12, 2019,  4:45pm 8 same here. oh here’s something just released half an hr ago https://www.notebookcheck.net/Unconfirmed-Diablo-IV-details-spotted-in-4-month-old-leak-full-class-roster-revealed.442665.0.html Let’s get straight to the unconfirmed details and don’t forget to keep some of that tasty salt handy: Some of the features from Diablo III including the Kunai Cube, wardrobe loadouts, seasonal journeys, Rifts/G-Rifts could make a comeback In contrast, Blizzard took all the fan critique in regards to Diablo III’s mistakes very seriously and modified some key aspects accordingly The new soundtrack is supposed to pay homage to the Diablo 1 and 2 OSTs Diablo II Remake/Remaster was an option at some point, but Blizzard realized that the franchise actually needs a reboot that would combine the best features from Diablo 2 with modern mechanics The combat system focuses on combos and is designed to be console-friendly Tristram was one of the hub cities in the early preview In addition to Barbarian, Sorcerer and Druid, Blizzard plans to include Paladin and Amazon as part of the starting class roster. Necromancer is planned for the first expansion. Closed beta is planned for 2020 Depending on how things go with the closed beta, launch could happen in late 2020 or early 2021 Diablo IV will also be launched on [Playstation 5] and [Xbox Scarlett] @FOMOF  with all these other crap games like COD being online only for console, why is it such a stretch to think, based on an open world map, that we’re not online only… couch co-op can still work online only… 2 Likes SpinningFury-11403 November 12, 2019,  5:38pm 9 Thats good… Im guessing its gonna be like PoE on console.
