Neighborhood of Los Angeles in California, United States Century City Neighborhood of Los Angeles Century City in 2009 Century City Location of Century City in West Los Angeles Coordinates: 34°03′20″N 118°25′01″W ﻿ / ﻿ 34.05556°N 118.41694°W ﻿ / 34.05556; -118.41694 Country United States State California County Los Angeles City Los Angeles Named after 20th Century Studios Elevation [ 1 ] 88 m (289 ft) Time zone UTC-8 ( PST ) • Summer ( DST ) UTC-7 (PDT) ZIP Code 90067 Area code(s) 310 , 424 Century City is a 176-acre (71.2 ha) neighborhood and business district in Los Angeles , California, United States. Located on the Westside to the south of Santa Monica Boulevard around 10 miles (16 km) west of downtown Los Angeles , Century City is one of the most prominent employment centers in the Los Angeles metropolitan area , and its skyscrapers form a distinctive skyline on the city's westside. The district was developed on the former backlot of 20th Century Studios —the film studio from which the district partially derived its name—and its first building was opened in 1963. Important to the economy are the Westfield Century City shopping center, business towers, and the Fox Studio Lot. [ 2 ] History [ edit ] Avenue of the Stars in Century City in 1978 The land of Century City belonged to cowboy actor Tom Mix (1880-1940), who used it as a ranch. [ 3 ] It later became a backlot of the former 20th Century Fox film studio, which still has its headquarters just to the southwest. [ 3 ] The area is named for 20th Century Pictures , which merged with Fox Film in 1935 to form 20th Century Fox. In 1956, Spyros Skouras (1893-1971), who served as the President of the former 20th Century Fox from 1942 until 1962, and his nephew-in-law Edmond Herrscher (died 1983), an attorney sometimes known as "the father of Century City", decided to repurpose the land for real estate development. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The following year, in 1957, they commissioned a master-plan development from Welton Becket Associates, which was unveiled at a major press event on the "western" backlot later that year. [ 3 ] In 1961, after Fox suffered a string of expensive flops, culminating with the financial strain put on the studio by the very expensive production of Cleopatra , the film studio sold about 180 acres (0.73 km 2 ) to developer William Zeckendorf and Aluminum Co. of America, also known as Alcoa , for US$54 million (US$533 million in 2023 money) who had plans for a $300 million (3 billion 2023) development. [ 3 ] Herrscher had encouraged his uncle-in-law to borrow money instead, but once Skouras refused, he was out of the picture. [ 3 ] The new owners conceived Century City as "a city within a city". [ 5 ] In 1963, the first building, Gateway West Building , was completed. [ 3 ] The next year, in 1964, Minoru Yamasaki designed the Century Plaza Hotel . [ 3 ] Five years later, in 1969, architects Anthony J. Lumsden and César Pelli designed the Century City Medical Plaza . [ 6 ] Geography [ edit ] According to the City of Los Angeles Department of City Planning, Century City constitutes census tract 2679.01. [ 7 ] Century City is generally bounded by Santa Monica Boulevard to the north, the city of Beverly Hills to the east, Pico Boulevard to the south, and Century Park West to the west (including the west side of Century Park West between Santa Monica Boulevard and Constellation Boulevard). [ 8 ] These boundaries correspond with those recognized by the Century City Business Improvement District Association. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Neighboring Century City are Beverly Hills to the east, Cheviot Hills to the south, West Los Angeles to the west, and Westwood to the north. Mapping L.A. [ edit ] The Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times extends Century City's western boundary to Beverly Glen Boulevard . [ 11 ] However, this more expansive definition is not consistent with other L.A. Times reports: a 1999 article sets Century Park West as Century City's western boundary, [ 12 ] and a 2017 article refers to the neighborhood to the west of Century City (between Century Park West and Beverly Glen Boulevard) as distinct from it.
