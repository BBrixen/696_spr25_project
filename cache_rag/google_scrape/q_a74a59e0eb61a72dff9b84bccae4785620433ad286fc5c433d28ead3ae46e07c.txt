Any word on an Offline mode? - PC General Discussion - Diablo IV Forums Diablo IV Forums Any word on an Offline mode? PC General Discussion ssgfrogg-1958 October 25, 2023, 11:12pm 1 Any word on if there will be an offline mode?  It would be great to be able to play without my character rubber-banding around the screen every time the servers get overloaded or my internet company decides to suck. 4 Likes Ioneye-1442 October 25, 2023, 11:17pm 2 They probably won’t do it… It would be too easy for players to just bot / trainer their stuff instead of engaging with battle passes, true online / offline = huge cheating problems. Diablo 3 on PC was online only, but with an actual solo mode too at least. I think it would be nice to play without rubber banding too, it happens to me once in a while still. The servers haven’t really been amazing. 2 Likes ssgfrogg-1958 October 25, 2023, 11:52pm 3 I wish I could believe that Blizzard had benevolent reasons for not wanting to do an offline mode, like preventing cheating, but that’s not even close to true.  They don’t care if people cheat in their offline games because offline cheating doesn’t impact anyone else. They just want to try to sell more stuff in the online store.  But, unfortunately, the internet issues make playing D4 far less enjoyable than it could be. 5 Likes Avalon-11311 October 25, 2023, 11:54pm 4 “So we are not going to support an Offline Mode.” - Angela Del Priore, Associate Game Director 4 Likes Vladrik-11576 October 26, 2023, 12:00am 5 Is there word on it? Yes, but the word is simply no. I think it would he a good thing if they did, but they have said plain and simple no. 1 Like MissCheetah-1661 October 26, 2023, 12:24am 6 ssgfrogg: Any word on if there will be an offline mode? They have answered that one many times. There will be no offline version of Diablo 4. It was made as an online only game from the start and was announced as such. They have continued to say that it will stay that way ever since. ssgfrogg: I wish I could believe that Blizzard had benevolent reasons for not wanting to do an offline mode, like preventing cheating, but that’s not even close to true. Diablo 3 also has no offline mode on PC, and on consoles the Seasons are online only. Despite players asking for it since game release in 2012. There is no MTX or store for D3 at all, and still no offline mode for it either. It is not about the MTX in this case. 3 Likes ssgfrogg-1958 October 26, 2023, 12:49am 7 Why is it online-only if there aren’t any social features?  I never see any other players and it’s not like WoW where there’s group dungeons and raids. 1 Like ColonGlock-1521 October 26, 2023, 12:55am 8 Came home eager to play and it is just lag city. Too bad. 1 Like Winter626-1588 October 26, 2023,  1:00am 9 MissCheetah: consoles the Seasons are online only Just nitpicking this point here. On consoles, the moment seasons start, there’s modded gear as far as the eye can see on the leaderboards. My first experience in D3, was a modded player dumping modded gear on me. Which was promptly thrown into recycling. Online mode would assume gear checks. Modded gear on PlayStation, Xbox and switch. 2 Likes MissCheetah-1661 October 26, 2023,  1:10am 10 Yeah, D3 Console has major cheating issues due to having an offline mode/offline saves apparently? I don’t play consoles so can’t even remotely claim to know much about it. People have argued that D3 should never have had an offline console mode at all. People are going to find ways to cheat no matter what platform or mode. All game companies can do it reduce the options for cheating (there are quite a few different ways), and enforce the rules they do have. Opening things for a free for all though, is usually a bad idea. I would love offline options too. I play on a laptop and playing when on travel, if I traveled still, would be great. I can live without it though. Almost everything I play is online only I think these days. D2R has an offline mode as long as you check in online every 30 days for a license validation I think. 3 Likes Winter626-1588 October 26, 2023,  1:16am 11 Yeah, it’s the offline saves that mainly allow it, if the saves were forced to be online server side, it would neutralise some of them potentially, honestly don’t know much about what goes into anti cheat / gear checks. For me, D4 being online only is a good thing, if my nets down, well, that’s a forced break and read a book time. magnafides-1350 October 26, 2023,  1:39am 12 MissCheetah: All game companies can do it reduce the options for cheating The main problem with D3 is that Blizzard never even did any of the basic things to prevent cheating on consoles. Like, how hard is it to not allow gear with wildly impossible specs into online play? 2 Likes Thorrand-1389 October 26, 2023,  1:47am 13 I used to accept the excuse because an offline mode would allow too many exploits. Judging by s1 and s2 now that is clearly not the case and I just acknowledge it as DRM and the opportunity to sell skins no one cares about 4 Likes Apache222-1831 October 26, 2023,  1:51am 14 They got offline mode in Last Epoch. My old timey characters are there before they added multiplayer. There’s a real disconnect. Doesn’t even feel like the same game. Maybe Blizz can release an offline only version for extra $ and let it be moddable. Plus release the editor too. They can use it to recruit & develop talent as well. 2 Likes KarAzure-6107 October 26, 2023,  1:57am 15 yes…never /20charbecauseblizaardsaidso MissCheetah-1661 October 26, 2023,  2:11am 16 Thorrand: I used to accept the excuse because an offline mode would allow too many exploits. Judging by s1 and s2 now that is clearly not the case and I just acknowledge it as DRM and the opportunity to sell skins no one cares about Offline never ever has prevented exploits. Bugs happen. People then exploit them. Online or offline only changes how fast they might get stopped or fixed. Online mostly prevents tampering with game files that control char saves, gear, stats, mobs, game environment, etc. All that is prevented. What it does not prevent is botting/automation and exploiting game bugs. The main selling point for “online only” though, is not MTX - or D3 would have been offline seeing as it has no MTX. The main thing online only stops is piracy of games. So for the bean counters is it about money - game sales and intellectual property rights. For gamers it does help remove some of the aspects of cheating. At least you are not up against god mode char edited chars with insane armor. Thorrand-1389 October 26, 2023,  2:14am 17 MissCheetah: or D3 would have been offline seeing as it has no MTX. It had a rmah at launch and even after that shut down why would they waste the resources to make it offline as well? I do believe the console ports are offline capable though 1 Like MissCheetah-1661 October 26, 2023,  2:16am 18 Thorrand: rmah at launch HUGE MISTAKE to have it even exist. D3 at launch was, in my opinion, horrible. As for the reason to have offline mode? Well, a LOT of people asked for it so if they had wanted, they could have. Console D3 has offline mode you know. They could have done that for PC but did not - and the cheating mess on consoles that made it back online kind of shows why. 1 Like Thorrand-1389 October 26, 2023,  2:22am 19 Oh it was terrible. Yeah I mentioned consoles being offline but didn’t that come out after shutting off the rmah and RoS expansion? I don’t remember it’s been a minute. D2 had that issue for like a decade as well (unsure if it persists into d2r) but yes I agree the primary reason was DRM Winter626-1588 October 26, 2023,  2:57am 20 Kinda glad PC didn’t get the hot mess that console had with the modded gear. There were enough problems trying to keep rift runs clean and uninterrupted, usually ended up being closed games with invite friends only. next page → Home Categories Guidelines Terms of Service Privacy Policy Powered by Discourse , best viewed with JavaScript enabled
