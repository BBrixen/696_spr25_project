A further $475M is “earned by results in the 63 games,” with $2M paid for winning group stage games, $7.5M for playing in the round of 16 and $40M to the team that wins the final. The top-ranked European team that “won all its group-stage games and advanced through the knockout rounds to win the title would get to” $125M in earnings. Each of the 12 European teams “will be paid at least” $12.81M as an entry fee, while the six South American teams each will get $15.21M and teams from Africa, Asia and the Concacaf region each will get $9.55M. FIFA also “aims to share” $250M “among clubs worldwide who did not qualify for the tournament.” It is “unclear how many clubs will be paid, or how much they will get” ( AP, 3/26 ).
