But then he agreed to work with the FBI to catch his "blacklist" of mobsters, spies and international terrorists -- on the condition that he must work with profiler Elizabeth Keen. Red's true intentions -- choosing Liz, a woman with whom he seemingly has no connection -- are unclear. Does Liz have secrets of her own? Red promises to teach Liz to think like a criminal "to see the bigger picture," whether she wants to or not.

The Blacklist — Season 1 What to Know Critics Consensus James Spader is riveting as a criminal-turned-informant, and his presence goes a long way toward making this twisty but occasionally implausible crime procedural compelling. Read Critics Reviews Critics Reviews View All (57) Critics Reviews Allison Keene The Hollywood Reporter Blacklist came out like gangbusters, quite literally, even though James Spader is really all the reason we need to keep watching for now. Dec 8, 2018 Full Review James Poniewozik TIME Magazine The Blacklist, though, seems to be setting itself up to be largely a bad-guy-of-the-week show, and the pilot's first caper is not too promising in that respect. Dec 8, 2018 Full Review Jeff Jensen Entertainment Weekly Here and now, The Blacklist is top-of-the-list escapism. Rated: B+ May 9, 2017 Full Review Matt Roush TV Guide Blacklist is the more purely and criminally enjoyable of the night's new melodramas, largely because James Spader is so good at being playfully bad. Dec 8, 2018 Full Review Tim Surette TV.com A lot of the snazzy action and spiffy pacing may be a cover-up for subpar writing, but the pilot kept things entertaining enough that I'd like to see the second episode. Hopefully it will clear up a few things. Dec 8, 2018 Full Review Adam Sweeting The Arts Desk The Blacklist, a slick and surprisingly brutal spies-and-black-ops drama that speeds along blithely without an original thought in its head. Jul 23, 2018 Full Review Read all reviews Audience Reviews View All (128) audience reviews Brittany B The role of the girl Masha she kind of got really annoying and became a really bad actress. After a while I can't even stand to watch the show anymore because of her Rated 3/5 Stars • Rated 3 out of 5 stars 04/11/25 Full Review Don J Love the show.  But, Lizzie is a moron.  She needs to go back for remedial training. Rated 4.5/5 Stars • Rated 4.5 out of 5 stars 03/24/25 Full Review Philippa M The series is quite fun and James Spader is a fine actor but I was utterly distracted by the female lead. Why on earth make her look like a heavily painted flawless doll in a wig? Never a hair out of place despite supposedly being in highly stressful situations. And her acting was also bland. Who cast her in this way? I’m sure she’s a better actor than this series gave her the opportunity to be. Rated 3/5 Stars • Rated 3 out of 5 stars 10/15/24 Full Review Artin S Underrated. Golden at some times, the story slows down a bit at others. Rated 4/5 Stars • Rated 4 out of 5 stars 10/13/24 Full Review Brighton G The episodes are fairly hit or miss, but on the whole it's pretty enjoyable. I just wish that the writing relied less on "techno contrivances" to solve the cases. Rated 3/5 Stars • Rated 3 out of 5 stars 06/19/24 Full Review Joe C An interesting premise, but undermined by weak writing. Spader's character is the only stand-out and he's overplayed. A stronger actress than Megan Boone might've breathed some life into her character, but the producers opted for optics (cutesy) instead. The other regulars from The Chief on down mouth cliches and express varying degrees of anger to show their range. Judging from the ratings, however, a majority of viewers are unable to discern the shortcomings and are deserving of what they get.
