Fernandes clipped the ball into the net in the 52nd minute, ending Spain’s run of 12 consecutive wins and handing the Spanish team only its second loss in 50 games. Spain’s other loss during the stretch was to the United States, at the Confederations Cup in South Africa last year. Spain outshot the Swiss 24-8 and held the ball 63 percent of the time, but could find no way through Switzerland’s determined defense. It was Switzerland’s first win over Spain. Eren Derdiyok created Switzerland’s goal by surging through the center of Spain’s defense and rounding Iker Casillas on one of Switzerland’s rare attacks. Gerard Pique’s desperate tackle stopped Derdiyok, but Fernandes was on hand to pounce on the loose ball and score.

Uruguay 3, South Africa 0 PRETORIA, South Africa – Diego Forlan scored two goals, helping Uruguay to a victory that pushed South Africa closer to being the first host nation to go out in the opening round of a World Cup. Forlan scored on a deflected 25-yard shot in the 24th minute and converted a penalty kick in the 80th to give Uruguay its first World Cup victory since a group game at the 1990 competition. Alvaro Pereira added the third score in injury time. Uruguay has four points from two games in Group A, while South Africa has one and needs to beat France on Tuesday to have any chance to stay in the competition.
