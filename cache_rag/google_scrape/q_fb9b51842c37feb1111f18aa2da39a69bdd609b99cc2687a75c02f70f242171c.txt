Under center last year, Hopkins Jr. became the first player in Academy history to throw and rush for 1,000 yards in the same season. He also registered five rushing touchdowns in the Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl to tie the Army single-game record. "Kelvin stepped up last season and led our team to a historic year in what was really his first season as a starter," head coach Jeff Monken said. "His dual-threat ability has allowed us to open the playbook with success. I'm proud of the strides he's made under center over his time here at the Academy and I'm really looking forward to seeing what he can do for our program during his senior season." The Charlotte, N.C., native closed out his first year as the primary play caller with 17 rushing touchdowns, which tied Carlton Jones '06 and Trent Steelman '13 for a single-season program record. The Black Knights kick off their season Aug. 30 when they host Rice at Michie Stadium at 6 p.m. Army will be looking to start the season off right with its 14th straight home victory. ------ The Maxwell Award is a member of the National College Football Awards Association (NCFAA), which encompasses the most prestigious awards in college football.
