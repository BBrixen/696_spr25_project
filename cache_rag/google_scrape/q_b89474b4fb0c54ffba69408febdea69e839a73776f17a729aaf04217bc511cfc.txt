The Games were gathered around two main venues: these were the mountain resort of Alpensia in Pyeongchang for the outdoor (snow) sports (Nordic and alpine skiing, bobsleigh, etc.) and the coastal city of Gangneung for the indoor (ice) sports (figure skating, ice hockey, etc.) There were also two stand-alone mountain venues. The Games had a total of 13 competition venues, six of which were constructed especially for the Games. The last venue to start being constructed was the long track speed skating oval in Gangneung; work began on this in October 2014. Some of these venues were used for the 2024 Winter Youth Olympics , held in Gangwon .
