[ 1 ] It is played on the weekend of the third Friday in July, and is the last of the four major championships to be played each year. [ 2 ] In addition, this championship is conducted by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (R&A). The championship was not held in 1871 due to a disagreement over a new trophy, [ 3 ] from 1915 to 1919 and from 1940 to 1945 due to the First and Second World Wars respectively, and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic . [ 4 ] The reigning champion of the competition is automatically invited to play in the other three majors ( Masters , the U.S. Open , and the PGA Championship ) for the next five years. The prize of the tournament is the Golf Champion Trophy, commonly known as the Claret Jug , and the champion personally keeps the trophy until the next competition the following year. The champion also receives a gold medal, which they are allowed to keep permanently. Until 1870 the champion received the Challenge Belt , however when Tom Morris Jr. (more commonly known as Young Tom Morris ) won the Open Championship three times in a row he won the belt outright, necessitating the need for a new trophy. [ 3 ] Harry Vardon holds the record for the most Open Championship victories, winning six times during his career. [ 5 ] The oldest winner of the Open Championship is Tom Morris Sr. (or Old Tom Morris ) who was 46 years and 102 days old when he won in 1867 . His son, Tom Morris Jr., is the youngest winner of the championship, he was 17 years and 156 days old when he won the 1868 Open Championship . He also won the most consecutive times with four victories (1868–1872). Henrik Stenson and Cameron Smith hold the distinction of being both the most strokes under par for 72 holes (−20), [ a ] which they achieved in 2016 and 2022 respectively. [ 6 ] Stenson also recorded the lowest total score (264) when he won in 2016. [ 7 ] Xander Schauffele is the current champion, winning the 2024 Open.
