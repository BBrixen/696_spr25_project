Would not the money spent to make such expensive crossovers be better spent on a second amplifier and electronic or passive line level crossover? These are the questions so few audiophiles are willing to ask. Read More navigate_next Thoughts on the Topic of Noise Published On 2/28/2025 Noise is a sensitive subject among audiophiles, and many are obsessed with eliminating it completely from their systems. Depending on the noise level it can certainly make ones listening experience less than desirable. When it comes to noise in an audio system, we can look at it from several different perspectives, but for this discussion we will just focus on a few. Read More navigate_next Thoughts on the Topic of Measurments Published On 1/31/2025 The topic of measurements is a touchy subject in the audiophile world. I once had a technical conversation with the late A.J. Conti from Basis Audio at one of the old Newport shows. At one point he asked me why audiophiles seemingly ignore how component engineering and measurements impact the sound. Read More navigate_next Where Does Damping Come From? - Part 2 Published On 12/31/2024 In last month’s Roger’s Corner, we had a somewhat lengthy piece about damping. To summarize, damping is a misunderstood term and perhaps not as relevant today from the perspective of how an amplifier interacts with the speaker. Today it is more important to understand how damping impacts amplifier output regulation and the output impedance. Read More navigate_next Where Does Damping Come From? - Part 1 Published On 11/30/2024 When matching an amplifier to a speaker, damping is a relevant term one should become familiar with. Especially as it relates to the amplifier, where it may be more appropriate to refer to damping as output regulation. It has been my experience that when you get the amplifier and speaker interface correct, it makes it easier to have everything upstream fall into place. Read More navigate_next Thoughts on How to Listen Published On 10/31/2024 Regardless of the components that make up their system, audiophiles enjoy listening to the music their system reproduces. However, audiophiles often do not understand what to listen for to determine if their system is reproducing music optimally, or even more important how to fix it if anything is wrong. Read More navigate_next Output Transformer Less (OTL) Amplifier Circuits - Part 2 Published On 9/29/2024 This month’s Roger’s Corner features the second of two articles that Roger wrote explaining Output Transformer Less (OTL) amplifier circuits. This article is a white paper of sorts that describes the circuit of Roger’s OTL-1 amplifier. This is a unique amplifier in many aspects compared to other OTL circuits. It would not be Roger if it were not unique in some way. Read More navigate_next Output Transformer Less (OTL) Amplifier Circuits - Part 1 Published On 8/24/2024 This month’s Roger’s Corner features the first of two articles that Roger wrote explaining Output Transformer Less (OTL) amplifier circuits. Roger’s favorite amplifiers were OTLs or direct drive. If he could avoid the use of an output transformer in a circuit, he would.

Read More navigate_next A Beginners Guide and Other Thoughts on Audio - Chapter 7: Tubes vs. Transistors Published On 6/25/2024 This month’s Roger’s Corner focuses on the topic of tubes versus transistors which was one of Roger’s favorite topics. During his career Roger became well known for his tube circuits, but his very first commercial circuit designs were the bass amplifier and active crossover for the Beveridge 2SW loudspeaker system (the preamplifier for this system was a tubed circuit). Read More navigate_next A Beginners Guide and Other Thoughts on Audio - Chapter 6: Digital Published On 6/1/2024 This month’s Roger’s Corner focuses on the topic of digital. First, I was very surprised to see that Roger wrote a chapter on this topic. Roger often told me that he had no desire to design digital equipment. He was very happy with his Sony CD players that he felt were reliable and easy to service. I will let those interested read the chapter to find out why audio playback quality was not part of that last sentence. Read More navigate_next A Beginners Guide and Other Thoughts on Audio - Chapter 5: Noise Reduction Published On 4/17/2024 This month’s Roger’s Corner focuses on a topic very near and dear to Roger. As an audio designer and repair technician Roger certainly had a few pet peeves. However, the one that annoyed him the most was noise. Roger was well known for designing quiet components.

Just thinking about them brings warmth to our hearts, spreading joy and making the world a better place. December feels like an entire month filled with that same puppy-and-kitten magic—a time for pure goodness, where giving for the sake of giving and doing good just to do good feels deeply rewarding. It’s about that heartwarming feeling you get when you selflessly make someone else’s day a little brighter, expecting nothing in return except maybe the glow of having done something meaningful.

While many define success in terms of money, in a non-profit like ours, community is the true currency. But how do you measure the value of community? How do you quantify the worth of friendship? Perhaps the currency of a strong community is indeed more valuable than money.

Morello's facility for playing unusual time signatures and rhythms enabled that group to record a series of albums that explored them. The most notable of these was the first in the series, the 1959 album Time Out, which contained the hit songs "Take Five" and "Blue Rondo à la Turk". In fact, "Take Five", the album's biggest hit (and the first jazz single to sell more than one million copies) was specifically written by Desmond as a way to showcase Morello's ability to play in 5 4 time."

My record collection now contains the majority of Sinatra’s recorded work. Read More navigate_next Various Artists – Not Fade Away Published On 3/25/2025 Buddy Holly (1936-59) is, of course, a genuine icon of rock’n’roll music.  He wrote most of his own songs – not common at the time—and was one of the musicians that helped to define the genre.  On the face of it, the concept of getting a bunch of different country/pop stars to contribute to a tribute album to him might seem kinda lame, right?  For my part, I would have forecast the likely result to be half-hearted artists turning in uninspired covers with subpar production and a dose of compression.  Also, that faded gray cover with the superimposed artist list almost makes it look like a cheapo bootleg and gives a rather poor first impression. Well… it could have been a colossal mess, but it most certainly isn’t.  The stars on this disc are some of the best in the business, and not only did they not phone in their recordings of these songs, most seemingly put their hearts into it – it sounds like it was probably fun for them.

It was never released as a CD, and I will be surprised if you can find it on any of the streaming services. Read More navigate_next Lacy J.

Of course you do.  His is a name well-known to... well, just about everyone.  Even those unfortunate folk who aren’t much into music know that he is of the greatest figures in popular music of nearly the last sixty years.  (It’s hard to believe, but he is now 83.)  Hearts and Bones, his 6th solo studio album, was meant to be a Simon & Garfunkel reunion album, and some songs were recorded with Garfunkel.

Read More navigate_next Holly Cole – The Best of Holly Cole Published On 10/31/2024 I depart from my usual writing about and advocating for vinyl to pontificate about a most worthy album which is not – regrettably – available in that preferred format, but only available as CD. Many audiophiles are aware of Holly Cole, and I may be “preaching to the choir” to some readers, but a great number are not.  She has been a fixture of the Canadian jazz scene since the late 1980’s, when she moved from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Toronto.  There she formed the Holly Cole Trio, the name used on her first four albums, and began releasing albums that have generally met with very good critical acclaim but only varying degrees of popular acceptance.  While she is somewhat well-known in the US, she is a virtual icon in Canada. Read More navigate_next Colter Wall - Imaginary Appalachia Published On 10/31/2024 Listening to Colter Wall’s vocal delivery draws the listener into a cramped, smoky bar with the image of an elderly C&W star playing for tips, the floor covered in sawdust, and the smell of stale beer heavy like a fog in the room. You could say the voice is rough and raw. The musical accompaniment is sparse and lacking in flash or flair. The combination is perfectly suited to the elemental lyrics that make you believe the composer isn’t just a songwriter but is someone who has lived the life of a poor country boy from the South.

If they don’t, they should.  Blind from the age of two, he was self-taught on the guitar and became one of the great masters of folk/ bluegrass/Americana.  He won 7 Grammys and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award – quite an accomplishment for any musician, much less a blind one.

Paul has always been a whirlwind when it comes to getting more recordings in the can, and at 82 years of age, his solo career is still going strong. But, while I thought I knew most of his recordings, it turns out that until recently I was unaware of The Fireman. While the creative output of The Fireman has not approached the volume of Paul’s other groups, it is a collaboration that has spanned a fair amount of time, beginning with 1993s Strawberry Oceans Ships Forest, followed in 1998 with Rushes, the collaboration with McCartney’s Liverpool Sound Collage in 2000, through 2008’s release of Electric Arguments. Read More navigate_next Grant's Guitar Corner Wes Montgomery Published On 8/23/2024 Wes Montgomery Down Here on the Ground by Grant Stoner My album pick for this month is Wes Montgomery’s Down Here on the Ground, A&M records 1968 vinyl (mono).  This record is the CTI division of A&M records.  Many jazz purists bemoan Creed Taylor’s (CTI head), adding of strings and extra instrumentation to “sweeten” the sound, and I pretty much agree.  I think he did that to dumb down the music to make it more saleable to the easy listening crowd.  I would of course prefer to listen to Wes in a standard trio format.  But the CTI records are nice testaments to the sound of the era and are kinda timeless classics.

The storyline is... well, mildly entertaining, but this isn’t a movie review.  Let me just explain that what we have here are four of the greatest male musical entertainers of the previous century, all of which were arguably at or reasonably near the height of their vocal powers.

Willie was old then, but now I am about as old as Willie was then, and he is even older now, obviously. And yet, Trigger, his guitar, is still his musical partner, even though Trigger has looked as if it was ready to disintegrate at any moment for as long as I can remember. But his performance, especially his guitar playing, and his signature vocal delivery stands out in my memory today. Read More navigate_next Meara O’Reilly,  Hockets For Two Voices Published On 6/25/2024 And now, for something completely different.  No, not music from a Monty Python sketch or film, but “different” this music is. Hockets were used primarily in vocal and choral music of the 13th and early 14th centuries. They were often found in sacred vocal music and string compositions. However, in the 14th century, this compositional device was most often found in secular vocal music. This secular association (never safe in medieval times) spurred a backlash from the church resulting in laws that outlawed hockets. I could find no information on whether performing hockets resulted in punishment on the rack, or not. Go figure.

He should at least be ensconced in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame!  He was an amazing guitar player, and his picture could reasonably be in dictionaries alongside the entry for rock’n’roll... well, or possibly by the entry for rockabilly.

Back some years ago, there weren't many female guitarists of note. Nowadays you can find 8 year old girls playing Paganini's 24th Caprice or Van Halen on guitar all over YouTube. But I think Emily Remler was one of the first truly great female guitar players, at least that I know of. And not just like the stupid old saying " pretty good for a girl". She can be mentioned in the same breath as any of the greats like Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass, Herb Ellis and so forth.

Read More navigate_next Al Hirt and Ann Margaret, Beauty and the Beard Published On 4/29/2024 Whoever thought of the unlikely pairing of trumpeter Al Hirt with singer/actress Ann-Margret on a record album somehow struck gold. These two talents play off of and complement each other to create a musical experience which is greater than at least most of the work either of the two produced separately. Read More navigate_next Oola’s May Music Pick, Felix Laband, Deaf Safari Published On 4/27/2024 Since I released my own album earlier this year, many people have asked what my musical influences were when I was first beginning to compose. That’s a difficult answer to pin down as I can remember so many styles of music being played in my home and my neighborhood from the time I could walk until the time I walked out of my childhood home. But, given that I started to compose in the late teens of this century when I was just out of my own teens, I think I can say that Felix Laband’s 2015 album, Deaf Safari was the inspiration for me to sit down and compile all of the different influences that shaped my musical tastes and try and regurgitate them into an album that reflects my own experience of being alive in these turbulent times.

Read More navigate_next Peggy Lee, Bewitching Lee! Published On 7/26/2023 Many audiophiles will have at least a passing familiarity with Peggy Lee (1920-2002), one of the best-known vocalists of her day and deservingly so.  This is Lee at her best, a wonderful collection of “Her Greatest Hits,” at least up to the time of its release, that anyone with ears and any appre-ciation for female vocals should enjoy.  A classic indeed. Read More navigate_next Laura Fygi - "Bewitched" Published On 7/25/2023 Not nearly as well-known in the US as in Europe, this Dutch jazz/torch/pop singer is a vo-calist to rank with Diana Krall, Holly Cole, and pretty much anyone else in the genre.  Her catalog includes about 15 albums, but if you only have one by her this should be it. Read More navigate_next Official National Lampoon Stereo Test & Demonstration Record Published On 6/30/2023 Since the dawning of the stereo age there have been vinyl test records.  These records generally contain special test signals developed for analyzing phono-cartridge performance as well as the phono-cartridge interaction with the tonearm and turntable.  To put it succinctly, every audiophile into vinyl should own a test record.  It can tell you many things you might not know about your system. Is your tracking correctly set up? The settings are at best a guess. Do you have Inner groove distortion?  A test record can help you find the culprit.

Hawaii: Music from the Islands of Aloha Read More navigate_next Two Feet    Momentum Published On 4/29/2023 I’ll be brief with this recommendation, just like the total length of the four tracks on this EP.  At just under 12 minutes, this album should leave you wanting more.  And it will, if your system survives the bone rattling bass that Brooklyn-based DIY artist, Two Feet (AKA Zachary William Dess) is famous for embedding in his music. Read More navigate_next Etro Anime- See The Sound Published On 4/27/2023 My album pic for this month is " See the Sound" by Etro Anime 2004 Neurodisc records CD. Etro Anime is an unusual somewhat electronica ensemble that fuses a lot of elements together. Somewhat electronica as there are a lot of live instruments as well. There's an element of drum n bass. If you don't know, drum n bass is a style of electronic music characterized by fast, complex drum beats and bass lines. Sounds like it would be intense, but as in LTJ Bukem's music, it can be mellow and beautiful. Not sure how that works, but it does. Etro Anime utilizes those programmed beats, but also live drums and bass guitar. Read More navigate_next Frank Sinatra & Duke Ellington “Francis A. & Edward K.” Published On 4/22/2023 My album pick for May is Frank Sinatra & Duke Ellington “Francis A. & Edward K.” From the sultry, luxurious sound of the first track “Follow Me” to the punchy “All I Need is the Girl”, Duke’s band is a great accompaniment to Sinatra’s typical vocalizations. Read More navigate_next Time For Three Published On 3/31/2023 Time For Three Letters For The Future Time For Three / Xian Zhang / Philadelphia Orchestra When it comes to modern day classical music I must admit I’m usually underwhelmed.  Sometimes repulsed.  But in the case of this Time For Three recording of two Pulitzer Prize winning composers works (written fifteen years apart but both commissioned for the group: Jennifer Higdon’s 2007 Concerto 4–3 and Kevin Puts’s brand-new Contact) on Letters For The Future- I was overwhelmed by how much I enjoyed the music and the recording.  A longtime friend alerted me to the album after he played the pieces with the Members of TF3 and the Marin Symphony.  Thanks to the miracles of Roon and Qobuz I was able to bring the music up while we were on the phone discussing the performances and the artists.  The music was so engaging I told my friend I would have to call him back after I was done listening to the album. Read More navigate_next Alphabet Soup "Layin' Low in the Cut" Published On 3/29/2023 My album pic for this month is Alphabet Soup " Layin' Low in the Cut". 1995 Swan Song records. CD. ​ Acid jazz is loosely defined as a music genre that combines elements of funk, soul, and hip hop as well as jazz. This album definitely fits that description. Unlike most hip hop, this group is built around an actual band performing on actual instruments, instead of deriving beats from samples, and it's an excellent band at that. I've seen them twice, so I can attest to that. Read More navigate_next Madhouse 8 Published On 2/18/2023 My album pic for this month is Madhouse 8 1987 Warner Brothers records vinyl. Honestly, I bought the album a long time ago ‘cause I liked the cover. The music was cool, kinda funky jazz instrumentals. It wasn't ‘till many years later, looking at Prince's discography, that I found out this was him.
