His four-shot lead after the first round was tied for second-largest in Masters history. It was Rose's fourth time holding the first-round lead at the Masters, tying Jack Nicklaus for the tournament record. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Defending champion Dustin Johnson opened with a two-over round of 74, ending his streak of 11 consecutive under-par rounds at the Masters, the longest in tournament history. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Will Zalatoris , making his Masters debut, eagled the par-5 15th and shot 70 (−2) to share fourth place.

He rebounded, though, with three birdies on the back-nine to shoot an even-par 72 and maintain a one-shot lead after 36 holes. [ 15 ] Masters rookie Will Zalatoris birdied his final three holes in a round of 68 (−4) to get into a tie for second place with Brian Harman , a shot behind Rose. [ 16 ] Jordan Spieth made a 30-foot birdie putt on the 17th and was part of a tie for fourth place at 5-under. Justin Thomas birdied all three holes around Amen Corner and didn't make a bogey until the 18th hole to shoot 67 (−5) and jump into a tie for sixth. [ 17 ] 54 players, scoring 147 (+3) or better, made the cut. Defending champion Dustin Johnson shot a three-over 75 and missed the cut by two strokes. Others to miss the cut included Rory McIlroy , who failed to make the weekend at the Masters for the first time since 2010, as well as 2020 runner-up Im Sung-jae .

When play resumed, Matsuyama birdied the hole from the trees on the right. He also birdied the par-three 12th before hitting his second shot on the par-five 15th to six feet and making the putt for an eagle. Matsuyama hit his approach at the par-3 16th to four feet for another birdie. After getting up-and-down from over the green on the 18th, Matsuyama carded a seven-under 65 and the only bogey-free round of the week, opening up a four-shot lead entering the final round. He was the first Japanese player to hold the overnight lead after any round at the Masters. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Justin Rose , leader after the first two rounds, birdied his first two holes to take a three-shot lead. But he made only one more birdie the rest of the round to go with three bogeys and shot an even-par 72 to join a group of four tied for second place. Xander Schauffele birdied the par-5 13th and holed a 61-foot eagle putt on the 15th to shoot 68 (−4). They were joined in second place by Marc Leishman and Masters rookie Will Zalatoris . [ 21 ] Corey Conners made a hole-in-one on the par-3 sixth hole, the sixth on that hole in Masters history, but three-putted from 30 feet on the 13th after having a chance at an eagle and bogeyed the 14th. He came back with birdies on the 15th and 17th to shoot 68 and sit alone in sixth place, five shots behind. [ 22 ] Jordan Spieth made four birdies but also double-bogeyed the seventh in an even-par round; he was six shots back in seventh place. Justin Thomas got within one of the lead after birdies on holes 2 and 3, but fell from contention after hitting his third shot on 13 into the tributary of Rae's Creek and making a triple-bogey 8.

Matsuyama came back with three birdies on the front-nine and led by as many as six shots on the back-nine. [ 24 ] Xander Schauffele , tied with Zalatoris for second at the start of the day, birdied the seventh and eighth holes, then made four straight birdies from holes 12 to 15 to get within two of Matsuyama. At the par-3 16th, Schauffele hit his tee shot into the water and made triple-bogey, dropping him out of contention. He shot an even-par 72 and finished at 7-under for the tournament, three shots back in a tie for third. [ 25 ] Matsuyama, meanwhile, bogeyed the par-3 12th after failing to get up-and-down from a greenside bunker. After making a birdie on the par-5 13th when his tee shot ricocheted off a tree back into play, he hit his approach shot on the par-5 15th into the water over the green for another bogey. Zalatoris birdied the hole and left his second shot on the 17th six feet from the flag for another birdie to finish at 9-under following a round of 70. [ 26 ] With a two-shot lead and two holes to play, Matsuyama two-putted for par on 17. At the 18th, he hit his second shot into the greenside bunker and missed a five-foot par putt but tapped in for bogey and a one-shot victory at 10-under. [ 27 ] With the win, Matsuyama became the first Japanese player to win the Masters and the first Japanese male to win a major championship.
