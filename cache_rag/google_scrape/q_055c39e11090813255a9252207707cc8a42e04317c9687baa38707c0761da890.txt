Members Online • Pek-Man The ridiculously dominant class of 2019 has won almost half of all Grand Tours, monuments, and World Championship road races since going pro Discussion Every year we have to learn about new riders that join the WorldTour or ProSeries for the first time in their careers. This year saw 112 riders go pro, some of them already showing great promise like Isaac Del Toro, Joseph Blackmore, Paul Magnier, Darren Rafferty, and António Morgado. But 2019 saw an absolutely ridiculous crop of neo-pros. 132 riders went pro. Among them were 18-year-old Remco Evenepoel, 20-year-old Tadej Pogačar, 22-year-old Jonas Vingegaard, and 23-year-old Mathieu van der Poel. Since the start of that season, the 2019 season, this quartet has absolutely dominated the biggest and most prestigious cycling races. They have won a ridiculous combined 23 of 50 Grand Tours, monuments, and World Championship road races since 2019. While the Grand Tour numbers are impressive, with Pogačar, Vingegaard, and Evenepoel all winning at least one and combining for a total of seven wins out of 17 possible, giving them a 41 percent win rate, it is especially in the monuments that this ludicrous crop of riders has dominated.

Mathieu van der Poel and Pogačar have snatched six each, with Evenepoel winning Liège-Bastogne-Liège two years in a row, combining for 14 wins in the last 28 monuments. Of course, none of us will be surprised if Pogačar take this tally to 15 in this year's Il Lombardia.

In the Olympics, the class of 2019 are also among the absolute favourites with Mathieu van der Poel and Remco Evenepoel both being among the frontrunners for the road race, while Evenepoel is of course also one of the big favourites for the time trial. It will be interesting to see who, if anyone, can smash the domination of this class that has already won so much but just now seems to be entering their prime. In total, they have amassed a ridiculous 212 wins since going pro in 2019: Rider Wins WorldTour Wins GC Wins ITT Wins Tadej Pogačar 84 64 16 7 Remco Evenepoel 56 23 12 15 Mathieu van der Poel 37 21 3 0 Jonas Vingegaard 35 21 8 2 Total 212 129 39 24 Interestingly, if we go back to the overall combined number between Grand Tours, monuments, and World Championship road races, the percentage will go just above 50 percent if we combine the 2018 and 2019 classes. As such, the 2018 class was also very, very strong with riders like Jai Hindley (2022 Giro winner), Sepp Kuss (2023 Vuelta winner), Jasper Philipsen (2024 Milano-Sanremo winner), and Kasper Asgreen (2021 De Ronde winner). Adding these four wins will take the total combined wins in Grand Tours, monuments, and World Championship road races to 27 of 50, a stupendous 54 percent win rate for the 2018 and 2019 classes.
