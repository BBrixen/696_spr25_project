June 1, 2021 | 7 It’s the first of June! Welcome to the official start of LEGO’s second half of 2021 (commonly referred to as 2HY) and with it, a whole slew of LEGO releases* That’s IF you’re lucky enough to outside of the Americas (North and South America) where you’ll have to wait until August for some of the newer releases. To help you navigate through the launch of all the new LEGO sets launching in June 2021 , here’s a handy guide! All the new LEGO sets are also now up on Amazon Australia with free delivery with spends over $30.

June is also the beginning of Pride Month, so to check out why I think this is LEGO’s most important set released this year, be sure to read my review of Everyone is Awesome Like owning a record-breaking set an a large centerpiece for your home? Then be sure to check out the LEGO World Map , which clocks in at 11,695 pieces, making this the biggest LEGO set by piece-count of all time. Check out Part 1 of my review of the LEGO World Map to see what I thought of the build so far, from a perspective of someone that wishes he had travelled more, and would want nothing more than the borders to open.

Saving up for the World Map next SUPER PUMPED! Reply Jay says: June 3, 2021 at 8:57 AM Nice one! Was eyeing the chess set but chose to go for the Buildable Minifigures instead. Hope you enjoy the sets! Reply James says: June 1, 2021 at 11:33 PM I’ll probably get the captain America one just for cap in his normal uniform with the headpiece and shield. Also gonna pick up Fawkes. Reply Joe says: June 1, 2021 at 8:05 AM Jay, you provide a tremendous service to the community. Thank you for this information. But (always a but) the ads. I count 7 ads and a banner. I’m all for monetising your content. It’s is great, but it’s slightly off putting. Maybe it’s because I don’t watch spicks and specks… Reply Daniel says: June 2, 2021 at 12:31 AM Joe, I’m viewing this article on my iPhone and I don’t see a single advert! Jay – keep up the great reviews & scoops: I love your website! Separately…. how many awesome sets are coming now / soon! There’s like 20 I’d love to buy, including Creator and Friends, as well as City (how awesome are the new animal moulds?!), Harry Potter & Ninjago, plus the Infinity Gauntlet ….. and especially “Everyone is Awesome (like all the colourful mono-figs!!). Reply Caroline B says: June 4, 2021 at 5:13 AM If there weren’t ads then the alternative would be that we wouldn’t have the great content because Jay mightn’t post or would choose to go down the Patreon route. I personally appreciate the ads since we get the content free. Would also be happy for Patreon. Content is fantastic! Thanks for the in depth list. Reply Jay says: June 4, 2021 at 9:44 AM Hey Joe, I’m sorry if you feel that the ads are a little too intrusive. I’m working with a third party who manages the ads, and I’ve insisted that they space the out the the ads between content as much as possible. I’ll try to see what I can do, however I also have some degree of control, so you should technically only see ads that relate to your browsing history or interests. Unfortunately, with server costs increasing (traffic this year has more than quadrupled this time last year!) and I have also invested into a much better server/provider so that there is less downtime. I’ve avoided going down to Patreon route as well (and affiliate income is quite patchy), so hopefully you’ll get used to the ads. That said, your feedback is really appreciated and I’ll see if I can dial it down slightly. Thanks once again for your support!
