[ 1 ] It was the 127th edition of the Wimbledon Championships and were held from 24 June to 7 July 2013. [ 2 ] It was the third Grand Slam tennis event of the year and was part of the ATP World Tour , the WTA Tour , the ITF Junior Tour and the NEC Tour . The championships were organised by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club and the International Tennis Federation . Roger Federer and Serena Williams were the defending champions in singles events, but neither was able to repeat their success: Federer was eliminated in the second round by Sergiy Stakhovsky , and Williams lost in the fourth round to Sabine Lisicki . This marked the first time since 1927 that both defending champions were eliminated before the quarterfinals. [ 3 ] Federer and Williams were two of a number of big-name casualties in the early rounds, along with two-time champion Rafael Nadal , two-time semifinalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga , 2004 champion Maria Sharapova and former World No. 1s Victoria Azarenka , Ana Ivanovic , Lleyton Hewitt , Caroline Wozniacki and Jelena Janković . Andy Murray became the first man from Great Britain to win the singles title since Fred Perry in 1936 . Marion Bartoli won the women's singles title. Bob and Mike Bryan completed the "Bryan Slam" and became the first team to hold all four Grand Slams and the Olympic Gold at the same time. Tournament [ edit ] Centre Court, where the Finals of Wimbledon take place The 2013 Wimbledon Championships was the 127th edition of the tournament and was held at All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in London. The tournament was an event run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and was part of the 2013 ATP World Tour and the 2013 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consisted of both men's and women's singles and doubles draws as well as a mixed doubles event. [ 4 ] There were singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18), which was part of the Grade A category of tournaments, and doubles events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players as part of the NEC tour under the Grand Slam category. The tournament was played on grass courts and was taking place over a series of 19 courts, including the four main showcourts, Centre Court , No. 1 Court , No. 2 Court and No. 3 Court . [ 5 ] Notable events [ edit ] Sergiy Stakhovsky caused an upset in the second round by defeating seven-time champion Roger Federer Sabine Lisicki caused one of the biggest upsets of the tournament by defeating reigning Wimbledon, US Open and French Open champion, world number one, Serena Williams , in the fourth round Rafael Nadal suffered his first ever opening round defeat at a Grand Slam tournament when he lost to Steve Darcis in the first round. This also marked the first time since 1997 in which the reigning French Open men's champion lost in the first round at Wimbledon. [ 6 ] Women's fifth seed Sara Errani also made a first round exit, losing to Monica Puig in straight sets. By defeating Benjamin Becker in the first round, Andy Murray won his 107th Grand Slam match, thus becoming the most successful British man at a Major and breaking Fred Perry 's total Grand Slam match win record of 106. [ 7 ] The 2013 championship saw numerous players retire in the first two rounds due to fatigue or injury, including Marin Čilić , Jo-Wilfried Tsonga , Victoria Azarenka , John Isner , and first round surprise Steve Darcis . On Wednesday, 26 June a total of eight players, including seven in singles events, withdrew from the tournament; four of those made the decision before the starts of their matches. Third-ranked Roger Federer fell in the second round to world number 116 Sergiy Stakhovsky , his first loss in a Grand Slam earlier than the quarterfinals since 2004 French Open , a streak spanning 36 majors. Federer's world ranking dropped to No. 5 as a result of this early exit. [ 8 ] Federer's second round loss also marked the worst collective performance by him and Rafael Nadal at a Grand Slam tournament, in which both men were entered. [ 9 ] This also marked the first time since 2002 in which neither man made the Wimbledon final. [ 10 ] For the first time since 1912, no U.S. man was represented in the third round at Wimbledon, following Bobby Reynolds 's second round defeat to World No. 1 Novak Djokovic . [ 11 ] Kimiko Date-Krumm became the oldest woman to reach the third round at Wimbledon, by defeating Alexandra Cadanțu in the second round. It was also the first time since the 1996 Wimbledon Championships in which she had gone this far. Her opponent, number one seed Serena Williams , combined for an age of 73, and this was their first ever meeting. [ 12 ] Date-Krumm lost in straight sets in the late evening encounter on Saturday 29 June 2013. Of the top ten women's seeds that started the Championships, six fell before the third round: second seed Victoria Azarenka (second round, withdrew), third seed Maria Sharapova (second round), fifth seed Sara Errani (first round), seventh seed Angelique Kerber (second round), ninth seed Caroline Wozniacki (second round) and tenth seed Maria Kirilenko (first round). This marked the worst performance by any top ten seeds at a Grand Slam tournament in the Open Era. [ 13 ] Laura Robson became the first British woman in 15 years to reach the fourth round at Wimbledon; by getting this far, she entered the Top 30 for the first time in her career. She thus became the first British woman since Jo Durie in 1987 to enter the WTA's Top 30. [ 14 ] Łukasz Kubot and Fernando Verdasco both reached the quarter-finals of Wimbledon for the first time, [ 15 ] whilst Juan Martín del Potro reached his first Grand Slam semi-final since winning the 2009 US Open . [ 16 ] Sloane Stephens and Kirsten Flipkens both reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon for the first time. [ 17 ] Sabine Lisicki continued her record of beating the reigning French Open champion at Wimbledon. She defeated Serena Williams in the fourth round, having also beaten Svetlana Kuznetsova in 2009, Li Na in 2011 and Maria Sharapova in 2012. [ 18 ] Lisicki's victory also denied Serena her 35th consecutive victory, a record which was achieved by her older sister, Venus , in 2000 . [ 19 ] This tournament marked the worst collective performance by Williams, Victoria Azarenka and Maria Sharapova at a Grand Slam event since the 2008 French Open , [ 19 ] and also the first tournament since the 2011 French Open in which none of the three reached a Grand Slam final. [ 20 ] Jerzy Janowicz became the first male Polish player to reach the semi-finals of a Grand Slam tournament. [ 21 ] By reaching the Wimbledon final, Sabine Lisicki became the first German Grand Slam singles finalist since Rainer Schüttler reached the final of the 2003 Australian Open , and the first German singles finalist at Wimbledon since Steffi Graf in 1999 . [ 20 ] Novak Djokovic won his semi-final match against Juan Martín del Potro in five sets in 4 hours 44 minutes. This was the longest semi-final in the history of the Wimbledon Championships . [ 22 ] With her win in the Ladies' Singles final, Marion Bartoli surpassed the female record set by Jana Novotná at the 1998 Wimbledon Championships for most appearances in a Grand Slam tournament before winning a title, with 47. [ 23 ] In winning the Gentlemen's Doubles, Bob and Mike Bryan became the first men's doubles team in the Open era to hold all four Grand Slam titles at the same time, as well as the only team in history to hold all four Majors and the Olympic gold medal. [ 24 ] Andy Murray defeated Novak Djokovic in the final in straight sets to win the 2013 Wimbledon Men Singles title, becoming the first British man in 77 years to do so, and the first Scot of either sex in 117 years to win a Wimbledon singles title. First Wednesday [ edit ] The first Wednesday (Wednesday 26 June) in the 2013 Wimbledon Championship saw a number of former world number ones knocked out in the second round of the draw either by being beaten by a much lower rank, having to retire early or having been " walked over ". These players include Roger Federer , Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka , as well as former ranking leaders Lleyton Hewitt , Ana Ivanovic , Jelena Janković and Caroline Wozniacki . Other notable players, including Jo-Wilfried Tsonga , Marin Čilić , John Isner , Steve Darcis , Yaroslava Shvedova and Radek Štěpánek also went out. A total of twelve seeded players (five men and seven women) finished their 2013 Wimbledon campaign on that day. [ 25 ] Events from "Black Wednesday" were highly commented, [ 26 ] inter alia by the Association of Tennis Professionals [ 27 ] and players [ 28 ] [ 29 ] and a statement from tournament Chief Executive Officer has been released.
