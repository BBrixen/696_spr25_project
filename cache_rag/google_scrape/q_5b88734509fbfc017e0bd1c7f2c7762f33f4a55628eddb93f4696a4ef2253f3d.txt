By Josh Sorokach Twitter @ joshsorokach Published April 9, 2020, 10:00 p.m. ET Photo: ABC Where to Stream: Grey's Anatomy Powered by Reelgood This was a year of change for ABC’s long-running medical drama Grey’s Anatomy . Not only did the immensely popular series say goodbye to one of its old-school cast members, Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), but the show was forced to end its sixteenth season early due to the escalating COVID-19 pandemic afflicting the globe. Season 16 is officially in the books, but what next season? When will Grey’s Anatomy Season 17 premiere on ABC? Here’s everything you need to know. STAT!* WILL THERE BE A SEASON 17 OF GREY’S ANATOMY ? Honestly, at this point, I’d be comfortable saying that there’ll be a Season 27 of Grey’s Anatomy . But to answer the question, yes! Back in May of 2019, ABC renewed Grey’s Anatomy for Seasons 16 and 17. WHEN WILL GREY’S ANATOMY SEASON 17 PREMIERE? *** UPDATE: Grey’s Anatomy Season 17 premieres Thursday, November 12 at 9:00 p.m. ET on ABC! *** No official release date has been announced, but Seasons 2 through 16 of Grey’s Anatomy have all premiered on ABC in September. Under normal circumstances, a September 2020 premiere date for Season 17 would be a near certainty, but production schedules have obviously been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Nobody knows how long this global crisis will last, but if productions are still experiencing shutdowns in June, July, or August, the Season 17 premiere of Grey’s Anatomy could be delayed until late 2020/early 2021. IS GREY’S ANATOMY ON NETFLIX? Yep. Seasons 1-15 of ABC’s long-running medical drama are currently available on Netflix. Photo: ABC WHERE CAN I WATCH SEASON 16 OF GREY’S ANATOMY ? Every Season 16 episode of Grey’s Anatomy is available to stream on Hulu, and the last five episodes of the current season are available to watch on ABC.com . * Stat means now.
