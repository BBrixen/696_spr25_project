The series, starring James Spader , Megan Boone , Diego Klattenhoff , Ryan Eggold , Hisham Tawfiq , and Harry Lennix , follows Raymond "Red" Reddington (James Spader), one of the FBI 's most wanted fugitives, surrenders at J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C. He claims that he and the FBI have similar interests in getting rid of dangerous criminals and terrorists. Reddington will cooperate only with Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone), a rookie FBI criminal profiler who we see in the first episode, has trouble profiling just herself and is not too keen on the idea. Over the course of his own criminal career, Reddington has made a list of global criminals who he believes are acting liabilities to his own interests or to society, most of whom are unknown to the FBI, and not on the FBI's " Most Wanted " list — he calls it "The Blacklist". As the series progresses, Reddington uses the FBI to apprehend enemies and strategic interests for his own personal gain. Executive producers for the series include Bokenkamp, John Eisendrath , and John Davis for Sony Pictures Television , Universal Television , and Davis Entertainment . During the course of the series, 218 episodes of The Blacklist aired over ten seasons, between September 23, 2013, and July 13, 2023.
