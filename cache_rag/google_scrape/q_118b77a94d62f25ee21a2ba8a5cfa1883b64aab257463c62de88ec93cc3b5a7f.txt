[ 146 ] His younger brother, Ketner, also played at Eastern Washington and was signed by the Los Angeles Rams as a free agent in 2019, participating in training camp and in preseason games, but was released during the final roster cutdown. [ 147 ] His grandfather, Jake Kupp , was an offensive lineman for the University of Washington and was selected in the ninth round of the 1964 NFL draft by the Dallas Cowboys. He played from 1964 to 1975 as a guard with Dallas, the Washington Redskins , Atlanta Falcons , and the New Orleans Saints . Named to the NFL All-Rookie team, he later was a five-time captain for the Saints. He was named to the franchise's 25-year All-Time Team and was inducted into the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame in 1991. [ 146 ] Kupp developed a close friendship with former Rams quarterback Jared Goff while living with him for a few weeks after the draft. They practiced on their own time together, watched films, studied defensive schemes, and learned the playbook. [ 148 ] [ 149 ] Kupp has been described as a devout Christian. [ 150 ] [ 146 ] As a senior in high school, Kupp met his girlfriend and future wife Anna Croskrey. [ 151 ] They got married in June 2015 and have three sons. [ 152 ] The family lives in Westlake Village, California during the season and Wilsonville, Oregon during the offseason.
