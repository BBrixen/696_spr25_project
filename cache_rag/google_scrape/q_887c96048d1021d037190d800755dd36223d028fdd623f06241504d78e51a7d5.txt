It was directed by James Cameron after his 1997 film Titanic . During August and September 2001, Cameron and a group of scientists staged an expedition to the wreck of the RMS Titanic . They dived in Russian deep submersibles to obtain more detailed images than anyone had before. Using two small, purpose-built remotely operated vehicles , the documentary offers glimpses into the Titanic wreck and, with CGI , superimposes the ship's original appearance on the deep-dive images. The film is narrated by actor Bill Paxton , who joined Cameron on the expedition and previously played Brock Lovett in the 1997 film . The film premiered for IMAX 3D and was nominated for a BFCA award for Best Documentary. The submersibles Mir 1 and Mir 2 carried the filming team on 12 dives.

While diving on September 11, 2001, the filming crew hears about the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon . Afterward, they compare and reflect on the tragedy of 9/11 with the tragedy of the Titanic.

( March 2021 ) Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that the documentary earned 80% positive reviews based on 102 reviews and an average score of 7.10/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "The underwater footage is both beautiful and awe-inspiring." [ 15 ] On Metacritic , the film has an average score of 67 out of 100 from 24 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews. [ 16 ] Soundtrack [ edit ] The official soundtrack's score was composed and conducted by Joel McNeely , and the orchestrations were conducted by David Brown, Marshall Bowen, and Frank Macchia. The album was also recorded and mixed by Rich Breen, edited by Craig Pettigrew, and mastered by Pat Sullivan. The album was ultimately produced by James Cameron , Randy Gerston, and Joel McNeely and released by Disney's Hollywood Records label. Part of the film was filmed in St. John's, Newfoundland , Canada. Toad the Wet Sprocket lead singer and songwriter Glen Phillips wrote the opening track, "Departure". James Cameron loved the band's 1991 track "Nightingale Song," but found Columbia Records' licensing fee too high (it wanted over $5,000 for the one minute he wanted to use). In response, he contacted the band's management hoping they could re-record it for his film, only to find they had broken up in 1998 and could not. However, during the negotiations, Cameron asked if Phillips would be interested in writing a new track in the spirit of the older song, and "Departure" was created. It was produced, mixed, and all instruments played by Phillips in his garage studio, though this was not credited in the CD booklet. The closing track is " Darkness, Darkness " by Lisa Torban.
