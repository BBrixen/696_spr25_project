It is governed by the Royal Spanish Football Federation , the governing body for football in Spain . Spain is one of eight national teams to have been crowned world champions and has participated in a total of 16 out of 22 FIFA World Cups , winning the 2010 edition, and qualifying consistently since 1978. Spain has participated in a total of 12 out of 17 UEFA European Championships , and are the reigning European champions, having won a record fourth title in 2024 . After their victory in the 2023 UEFA Nations League they became the second national team, following France , to win three major titles (World Cup, European Championship and Nations League ). Spain is also one of only two nations alongside Germany , to have won both women's and men's World Cups. [ 4 ] Having won one World Cup, one Nations League, and three European Championship titles since 2008, Spain is the most successful European national team of the 21st century. The team's achievements from 2008 to 2012 have led many experts and commentators to consider this era's squads one of the best ever teams in football history. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] During this period, Spain became the first national team to win three consecutive major titles , including two back-to-back European Championships in 2008 and 2012 , while becoming the first European team to win a World Cup held outside of Europe. [ 10 ] Also in this period from 2008 to 2013, Spain won the FIFA Team of the Year , the second-most of any nation, behind only Brazil . [ 11 ] One year before, from the start of 2007 to the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup , Spain achieved 35 consecutive undefeated matches, a feat which they shared with Brazil, and a record for the sport at the time. [ 12 ] History [ edit ] See also: History of the Spain national football team Spain national football team in the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp Spain has been a member of FIFA since its founding in 1904, even though the Spanish Football Federation was first established in 1909. The first Spain national football team was constituted in 1920, with the main objective of finding a team that would represent Spain at the 1920 Summer Olympics held in Belgium in that same year. Spain made their debut at the tournament on 28 August 1920 against Denmark , silver medalists at the last two Olympic tournaments. Spain managed to win that match by a scoreline of 1–0, eventually finishing with the silver medal. [ 13 ] Spain qualified for their first FIFA World Cup in 1934, defeating Brazil in their first game and losing in a replay to the hosts and eventual champions Italy in the quarter-finals. [ 14 ] The Spanish Civil War and World War II prevented Spain from playing any competitive matches between the 1934 World Cup and the 1950 edition's qualifiers . At the 1950 finals in Brazil, they topped their group to progress to the finals round, then finished in fourth place. [ 15 ] Until 2010, this had been Spain's highest finish in a FIFA World Cup finals. [ 16 ] Spain won its first major international title when it hosted the 1964 European Nations' Cup , defeating the Soviet Union 2–1 in the final at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium . [ 17 ] The victory would stand as Spain's lone major title for 44 years. Spain was selected as host of the 1982 FIFA World Cup , reaching the second round and four years later they reached the quarter-finals before a penalty shootout defeat to Belgium . [ 18 ] Also at UEFA Euro 1984 , they lost the final against France . [ 19 ] Spain reached the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Cup . The match became controversial when Italian defender Mauro Tassotti struck Luis Enrique with his elbow inside Spain's penalty area, causing Luis Enrique to bleed profusely from his nose and mouth, but it was not noticed nor sanctioned by referee Sándor Puhl . Had the official awarded a foul, Spain would have received a penalty kick. [ 20 ] In the 2002 World Cup , Spain won its three group play matches, then defeated the Republic of Ireland on penalties in the second round. They faced co-hosts South Korea in the quarter-finals, losing in a shootout after having two goals controversially called back for alleged infractions during regular and extra time. [ 21 ] World Cup champions parade celebrate as they pass in front of the Air Force Headquarters in Madrid . At UEFA Euro 2008 , Spain won all their games in Group D . Italy were the opponents in the quarter-finals match, which Spain won 4–2 on penalties. They then met Russia again in the semi-finals, beating them 3–0. [ 22 ] In the final , Spain defeated Germany 1–0, with Fernando Torres scoring the only goal of the game. [ 23 ] This was Spain's first major title since the 1964 European Championship. Xavi was awarded the player of the tournament. [ nb 1 ] The following year the side finished third at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup breaking their 35-match unbeaten streak that began in November 2006 after a loss to the United States . [ 24 ] In the 2010 World Cup , Spain advanced to the final for the first time ever by defeating Germany 1–0. In the decisive match against the Netherlands , Andrés Iniesta scored the match's only goal, coming in extra time. Spain became the third team to win a World Cup outside their own continent, and the first European team to do so. They then qualified for UEFA Euro 2012 , finishing on top of Group I with a perfect 100% record. [ 5 ] They became the first team to retain the European Championship, winning the final 4–0 against Italy, while Fernando Torres won the Golden Boot for top scorer of the tournament. [ 25 ] Spain advanced to the final of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup , losing to hosts Brazil, [ 26 ] and the following year they were eliminated from the group stage of the 2014 World Cup . [ 27 ] At Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup , the side reached the last 16 in both tournaments, losing to Italy 2–0 and Russia 4–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] In the UEFA Euro 2020 , held in 2021 after COVID-19 pandemic caused delays, Spain made a breakthrough, reaching the last four of a major tournament for the first time since 2012, before losing to eventual champions Italy 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The team finished the tournament with two wins and four draws (including two penalty shootouts). [ 30 ] The same year they managed to reach the 2021 UEFA Nations League final , losing against France. [ 31 ] In the 2022 World Cup , Spain finished second in their group, then in the round of 16, they lost to Morocco 3–0 on penalties after a 0–0 draw, to be the third consecutive elimination from a major tournament in penalty shootouts. [ 32 ] Spain finished top of their group in UEFA Euro 2024 without conceding a goal, and went on to defeat Georgia in the round of 16 by 4–1. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] They eventually eliminated hosts Germany in the quarter-finals with a 2–1 win and defeated France in the semi-finals with the same result, qualifying for their fifth European Championships final. [ 35 ] Spain won their record-breaking fourth European title by defeating England 2–1 in the final [ 36 ] [ 37 ] and became the first and only team to win all seven matches in a single European Championship tournament. [ 38 ] They also set a new record of 15 goals scored in a single European Championship. [ 39 ] Team image [ edit ] Nicknames [ edit ] Spain's team was known in the past by some fans as " La furia española ", ' the Spanish Fury ' ; this nickname was originally given by a Dutch newspaper, recalling the " Sack of Antwerp " – an episode in the military history of Spain. [ 40 ] More modernly, the team is called " La roja ", ' the Red (squad) ' . [ 1 ] Style of play [ edit ] Main article: Tiki-taka Spain, UEFA Euro 2008 winners Spain's players celebrate winning the 2010 FIFA World Cup . Spain, UEFA Euro 2012 winners Between 2008 and 2012, the team played a style of football dubbed 'tiki-taka', a systems approach to football founded upon the ideal of team unity and a comprehensive understanding in the geometry of space on a football field. [ 41 ] Tiki-taka has been variously described as "a style of play based on making your way to the back of the net through short passing and movement", [ 42 ] a "short passing style in which the ball is worked carefully through various channels", [ 43 ] and a "nonsensical phrase that has come to mean short passing, patience and possession above all else". [ 44 ] The style involves roaming movement and positional interchange amongst midfielders , moving the ball in intricate patterns, [ 45 ] and sharp, one or two-touch passing. [ 46 ] Tiki-taka is "both defensive and offensive in equal measure" – the team is always in possession, so doesn't need to switch between defending and attacking. [ 47 ] Commentators have contrasted tiki-taka with " Route One physicality" [ 42 ] and with the higher-tempo passing of Barcelona and Arsène Wenger 's 2007–08 Arsenal side, which employed Cesc Fàbregas as the only channel between defence and attack. [ 43 ] Tiki-taka is associated with flair, creativity, and touch, [ 48 ] but can also be taken to a "slow, directionless extreme" that sacrifices effectiveness for aesthetics. [ 44 ] Tiki-taka was successfully employed by Spain to win Euro 2008 , the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 . The 2008–12 teams are regarded as being among the greatest of international teams in football history. [ 7 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] They have the Barcelona "carousel" of Xavi and Andrés Iniesta augmented by Real Madrid's Xabi Alonso in midfield. — Phil McNulty of the BBC on the midfield players at the heart of Spain's tiki-taka passing style of play. [ 5 ] Sid Lowe identifies Luis Aragonés ' tempering of tiki-taka with pragmatism as a key factor in Spain's success in Euro 2008. Aragonés used tiki-taka to "protect a defense that appeared suspect [...], maintain possession and dominate games" without taking the style to "evangelical extremes". None of Spain's first six goals in the tournament came from tiki-taka: five came from direct breaks and one from a set play. [ 44 ] For Lowe, Spain's success in the 2010 World Cup was evidence of the meeting of two traditions in Spanish football: the "powerful, aggressive, direct" style that earned the silver medal-winning 1920 Antwerp Olympic team the nickname La furia española ( ' The Spanish Fury ' ) and the tiki-taka style of the contemporary Spain's team, which focused on a collective, short-passing, technical and possession-based game. [ 49 ] Analyzing Spain's semi-final victory over Germany at the 2010 World Cup , Raphael Honigstein described Spain's tiki-taka style as "the most difficult version of football possible: an uncompromising passing game, coupled with intense, high pressing". For Honigstein, tiki-taka is "a significant upgrade" of the Netherlands' Total Football because it relies on ball movement rather than players switching position. Tiki-taka allowed Spain to "control both the ball and the opponent". [ 47 ] Spain, UEFA Euro 2024 winners Spain held possession of ball more than their opponents in all matches from 2008 to 2024, a record of 136 games. [ 50 ] We have the same idea as each other. Keep the ball, create movement around and off the ball, get in the spaces to cause danger. — Xabi Alonso (Spanish midfielder). [ 46 ] Kits and crest [ edit ] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Spain national football team kits . Spain's home kit is traditionally a red jersey with yellow trim, dark blue shorts, and black socks, whilst their current away kit is predominantly yellow, having been white traditionally. The color of the home socks started to alter throughout the 1990s from black to the same blue color as the shorts, then matching either the blue of the shorts or the red of the shirt until the mid-2010s when they returned to their traditional black before continuing the rotation in the 2020s. Spain's kits have been produced by manufacturers including Adidas (from 1981 until 1983), Le Coq Sportif (from 1984 until 1990) and Adidas once again (since 1991). Rather than displaying the logo of the Spanish Football Federation, Spain's jersey traditionally features the country's coat of arms over the left side. After winning the 2010 World Cup, the World Cup winners badge was added to the right side of the jersey and a golden star at the top of Spain's coat of arms.

The capital city of Madrid ( Bernabéu and Metropolitano ), Seville ( Pizjuán , Villamarín and La Cartuja ), Valencia ( Mestalla and Orriols ) and Barcelona ( Camp Nou and Montjuïc ), are the four Spanish cities that have hosted more than 15 national team matches , while also being home to the largest stadiums in the country. [ 53 ] Other friendly matches, as well as qualifying fixtures against smaller opponents, are played in provincial stadia. The 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign included matches at the Reino de León in León , [ 54 ] Los Cármenes in Granada , [ 55 ] El Molinón in Gijón , [ 56 ] and the Rico Pérez in Alicante . [ 57 ] Media coverage [ edit ] Spain's UEFA Nations League , UEFA European Qualifiers and all friendly matches, are televised nationwide by La 1 , flagship television channel of the public broadcaster TVE .

In order by number of matches, Italy (41), Portugal (40), France (37), England (28) and Germany (27). Their rivalry with Italy , sometimes referred to as the « Mediterranean Derby», has been contested since 1920. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] Their first meeting was at the Olympic Games , in a 2–0 triumph for Spain on 2 September 1920 in Antwerp . [ 61 ] Although the two nations are not immediate geographical neighbours, their rivalry at international level is enhanced by the strong performances of the representative clubs in UEFA competitions, in which they are among the leading associations and have each enjoyed spells of dominance. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Since the quarter-finals match between the two countries at Euro 2008 , the rivalry has renewed, with its most notable match between the two sides being in the UEFA Euro 2012 final , which Spain won 4–0. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Spain has the advantage in the head-to-head, with 14 wins, 16 draws, and 11 losses, after 41 games, but both teams evenly split with 6 wins each when only competitive matches are counted. Their rivalry with Portugal , also known as the « Iberian Derby», has been contested since 1921. [ 67 ] Their first meeting was a 3–1 triumph for Spain on 18 December 1921 in Madrid, the first ever international game for the Portuguese. Portugal lost their first matches, with their first draw (2–2) only coming in 1926. Portugal's first win came much later (4–1) in 1947. In this friendly rivalry, Spain dominates the head-to-head record with 17 victories, 17 draws, and 6 losses, after 40 games. They also lead Portugal in competitive matches, with 5 wins to Portugal's 1 with 5 draws. [ 68 ] Their rivalry with France , sometimes referred to as the « Pyrenean Derby», has been contested since 1922. [ 69 ] Their first meeting was a 4–0 triumph for Spain on 30 April 1922 in Bordeaux , [ 70 ] though their first competitive meeting came in the UEFA Euro 1984 final , which France won to take over its first major international honours. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Spain has the advantage in the head-to-head, with 17 wins, 7 draws, and 13 losses, after 37 games. However, France has a major advantage in competitive matches, with 6 wins compared to just 3 of Spain. Their rivalry with England , has been contested since 1929. Their first meeting was a 4–3 victory for Spain on 15 May 1929 in Madrid, the first ever English defeat outside the British Isles. [ 74 ] The first of their nine competitive fixtures came at the 1950 World Cup in Maracanã , where Spain won 1–0 with a Telmo Zarra legendary goal. [ 75 ] In their another World Cup meeting in 1982 , Spain received England as hosts at the Bernabéu , in a second round stage match ended 0–0. [ 76 ] One year before, in 1981, Spain achieved its first victory at Wembley . [ 77 ] At the European Championship, they have met three times. In 1980 a group stage victory 2–1 for England in Naples. In 1996 a quarter-final match-up at Wembley ended 0–0 after extra time with England advanced on penalties. [ 78 ] Finally in 2024 , at the UEFA Euro 2024 final , with England were aiming to win their first European title, while Spain were looking for the continental titles record, Spaniards won 2–1 in Berlin, winning a record fourth Euro's championship. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 37 ] The head-to-head result for Spain is 11 wins, 4 draws and 13 losses, after 28 games. [ 81 ] [ 74 ] Their rivalry with Germany , has been contested since 1935. Their first meeting was a 2–1 victory for Spain on 12 May 1935 in Cologne . [ 82 ] Spain only met a German side for the first time in any competitive fixture in 1966, as part of the 1966 World Cup , where West Germany (competing separately from East Germany at the time) came back to win 2–1. [ 83 ] Since the German reunification in 1990, Spain has remained undefeated in competitive fixtures against Germany, winning 1–0 the UEFA Euro 2008 final , [ 84 ] [ 85 ] 0–1 the 2010 World Cup semi-final, an outstanding 6–0 in the 2020–21 Nations League , [ 86 ] and most recently in the Euro 2024 quarter-finals, 2–1 against the hosts after extra-time. [ 87 ] The head-to-head result is a tie with 9 wins each and 9 draws, after 27 games. Their rivalry with Netherlands , is one that has developed in recent years. Their first significant meeting came in the “final” of the 1920 Summer Olympics , where Spain defeated the Dutch 3-1 to win their first silverware in history. The team would meet again in another final 90 years later, this at the 2010 FIFA World Cup . In a very heated contest, marked by many fouls by the Dutch side, Spain would win their first ever World Cup. Spain and the Netherlands would not see each other again until four years later in the group stages of the 2014 FIFA World Cup , in a rematch of the final the previous edition, the Dutch handed Spain their biggest defeat in 60 years when they won 5-1. Their next competitive game came in the 2025 edition of the Nations League. Spain and Netherlands would face each other in a very exciting quarter final which ended in a 5-5 draw. Spain would go on to win the penalty shootout and eliminating the Dutch from the tournament.

FIFA World Cup [ edit ] Main article: Spain at the FIFA World Cup Although often entering tournaments as one of the favorites, Spain have often been perceived as underachieving at the World Cup. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Spain's first World Cup was in 1934 . At that World Cup, Spain started their campaign by defeating Brazil 3–1 to advance to the quarter-finals, where they lost to hosts Italy in a replay. [ 108 ] Before Spain's success in 2010, their best result came in 1950, where they reached the last four. Spain were paired with the hosts Brazil, as well as Uruguay and Sweden. [ 109 ] Spain managed a draw against Uruguay but defeats from Brazil and Sweden meant that Spain would end up in fourth place. [ 109 ] At the 2010 FIFA World Cup held in South Africa, Spain became world champions for the first time after defeating the Netherlands 1–0 in the final, becoming the eighth country to win the World Cup.

They have hosted the tournament once, in 1964 (one city was used to host games at Euro 2020 ) and have appeared in a total of twelve tournaments. The team won their first international trophy on home soil in 1964, defeating the Soviet Union 2–1. [ 113 ] [ 114 ] Spain would reach the final twenty years later in 1984 , where they would lose the final to France .
