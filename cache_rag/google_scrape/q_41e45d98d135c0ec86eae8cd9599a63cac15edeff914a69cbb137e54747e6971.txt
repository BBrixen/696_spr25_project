Responsibilities You Can Assign to a Virtual Assistant As an Amazon store owner, you have decided to hire a virtual assistant for your business. It is time to determine what roles and responsibilities you will entrust to the VA. There is no task that a virtual assistant cannot perform. However, you must assign tasks to a virtual assistant carefully. First, you can list all the functions and activities that consume much of your time. Next, you must decide what business activities you can perform only. The rest of the tasks and activities can be assigned to a virtual assistant. How to Hire a Virtual Assistant for Your Amazon Store? When hiring a virtual assistant for your Amazon store, the one size fits all concept will not work. Thus, it is advised that you make a checklist of all the business tasks and activities you want the virtual assistant to perform. By doing this, you will know how many virtual assistants you will need and in what area of specialization. Once you know the business needs, you can hire virtual assistants who will fulfill the requirements. In the next section of our blog, we have discussed a few tasks and activities that a virtual assistant can do for you. What Can a Virtual Assistant Do for You? 1. Research Activity Research is an integral part of any business. An Amazon VA will help you conduct proper product research to provide important information. This includes researching items to acquire at wholesale rates, negotiating with suppliers, obtaining the best bargains, and securing samples for products you sell on Amazon. Apart from doing product research, the Amazon virtual assistant can also be entrusted with researching and presenting the latest trends in your business domain. Through research, you, as a business owner, will get an idea about what strategies your competitors are working on. While your Amazon virtual assistant takes care of the research part, you can plan and implement a solution to help you compete with your business rivals. 2. Customer Support Amazon store owners will agree that customer support is an integral part of a business. It is a known fact that having an in-house team to take care of the customer support activities of your business can be time-consuming, and it requires investments. Besides, you are responsible for training and grooming your in-house customer support team. One of the feasible alternatives is to entrust the customer support responsibility to a virtual assistant or a team of VAs, and you can take care of the other business activities. You can delegate customer support services to your VA. Consistent customer service is essential to maintain positive reviews and a high-quality user experience. They can help you create message templates, answer customer questions, comment on reviews, address negative feedback, locate past orders, confirm FBM orders, and deal with refunds and product replacements. These are some of the customer's service tasks. 3. Product Listing and Optimization Product listing and optimization are one of the factors that drive sales. To ensure that the listings are cohesive and accurate according to Amazon guidelines, you need an Amazon VA to assist you with the tasks. An experienced Amazon assistant can help you track and double-check everything you've done to manage all listing optimizations. From looking at how you rank for specific Amazon keywords to supervising the optimization of your listings, an Amazon virtual assistant can help you track your Amazon performance. Amazon could update its product listing rules and regulations. When you hire an Amazon virtual assistant, it is the responsibility of the virtual assistant to be aware of the changes. 4. Running Amazon Ad Campaigns Amazon store owners will agree that running ad campaigns on Amazon is one of the ways to drive traffic to their Amazon store, which can lead to sales generation. An Amazon virtual assistant who knows ad campaigns and has experience running them will be an asset to your business. The Amazon VA will set up campaigns using Seller Central tools, input negative key terms to eliminate unnecessary spending, monitor analytics to check the performance of your campaigns, and make appropriate adjustments to ads. 5. Order Processing Order processing can be time-consuming. Hire an Amazon virtual assistant to take care of order processing, and you can take care of the other activities that require your time and attention. Some of the order processing tasks that an Amazon VA can help you with are sending in FBA inventory, obtaining Amazon barcodes for each unit, downloading shipping labels, monitoring shipments, and checking units received. 6. Translation Amazon is a global platform. You could be geographically located in one region, and your customer could be from another. Language can become a barrier. As an Amazon store owner, you must communicate effectively about the products and services you sell to your customers. Hiring an Amazon virtual assistant to help you convey your message to the customer will benefit you. Furthermore, the Amazon VA for translation will help you understand what the customer from the other end is attempting to say to you. Apart from the ones that we have discussed, Amazon virtual assistants are capable of doing more than this. As an Amazon store owner, you can decide what tasks to a virtual assistant will work best for your business. Before you assign tasks to an Amazon virtual assistant, ask yourself the three questions:- What is taking up most of your time? Which tasks are the most monotonous? What activities could someone else do better than you? You surely will be right in entrusting responsibility to a VA or your team of virtual assistants. Where to Find the Right Virtual Assistant?
