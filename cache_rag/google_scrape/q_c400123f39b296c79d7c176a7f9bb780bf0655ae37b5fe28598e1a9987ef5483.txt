Ice hockey [ edit ] See also: Miracle on Ice The 1980 hockey game between the U.S. and USSR was dubbed the " Miracle on Ice ", when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union on the way to a gold medal at the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid , New York . [ 3 ] The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the "Miracle" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the 1960 Games at Squaw Valley , California , defeating the Soviet Union, Canada , Czechoslovakia , and Sweden along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the "Forgotten Miracle". [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in 1988 . As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7–5 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh. The two teams met again at the 1992 Olympics in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5–2. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth. The U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the 1996 World Cup of Hockey . The Americans won both games 5–2 en route to the tournament championship. The U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by Slava Fetisov , met twice in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, which included a 2–2 round-robin draw and a 3–2 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the "Miracle on Ice" game. [ 6 ] The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze. The two teams met in the quarterfinals of the 2004 World Cup of Hockey , with the U.S. earning a decisive 5–3 victory. The U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The game was tied 2–2 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with T. J. Oshie scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States. The match has been dubbed by some as the "Marathon on Ice" due to its length. [ 7 ] Both teams, however, failed to medal; the Americans finished fourth (losing in the semis to Canada and to Finland in the bronze medal game), while the Russians placed fifth (losing to Finland in the quarterfinals).
