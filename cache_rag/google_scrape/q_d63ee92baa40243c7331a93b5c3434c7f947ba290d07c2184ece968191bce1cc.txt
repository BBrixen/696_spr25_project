[ 1 ] 92 teams qualified to compete (91 nations and Olympic Athletes from Russia ). Background [ edit ] Athletes entered the stadium in an order dictated by Olympic tradition. As the originator of the Olympics, the Greek team entered first. [ 2 ] Other teams entered in alphabetical order based on the names of countries in the Korean language . [ 3 ] Following tradition, the delegation from the host nation, South Korea, was scheduled to enter last. However, following solidarity negotiations with North Korea , the host nation was instead represented by the unified Korean delegation, consisting of the South Korean and North Korean teams, marching under the Korean Unification Flag . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The names of the nations were announced in French, followed by English and Korean, the official languages of the Olympic movement and the host nation, in accordance with traditional and International Olympic Committee (IOC) guidelines. Background music included such Korean songs from throughout the ages from as old as the folk song Arirang , to "Short Hair" by Cho Yong-pil and "The Beauty" by Shin Jung Hyun & Yup Juns of the 1970s, and modern K-pop hits such as " Gangnam Style " by Psy , " Likey " by Twice , " Fantastic Baby " by Big Bang , " DNA " by BTS , and " Red Flavor " by Red Velvet .

"Olympic" (올림픽 Ollimpik ), although in Korean their team name begins with the word "Russia" (러시아 Reosia ). ^ Italy and Israel switched positions in the parade so that the surrounding order was Iran → Italy → Israel (Hangul alphabetical order would have dictated Iran → Israel → Italy). An IOC spokesperson stated, without elaborating, that this decision "was taken at the time to reflect the appropriate protocols." [ 44 ] ^ Macedonia entered as its official name "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" in all languages, but paraded as if its name were "FYROM" (피롬 Pirom ), between France and Finland. If it were ordered with the word "former" (구 gu ), it would have marched third after Ghana. References [ edit ] ^ "NBC to Broadcast Winter Olympics Live Across all Time Zones" .
