Last night it was reported that the ankle injury is a high ankle sprain for Saquon, when it was previously believed to be a ankle sprain. This caught my attention because rarely are there miscommunications in reporting for injuries these days. That got me thinking. High ankle sprain also for Ekeler. Info is limited, no time table for return. He drops a hint to his fantasy owners to sign Kelley. Then I thought about the running back zoom call talking about contracts and running back market. High ankle sprains are a pain tolerance injury, without major concern for long term healing. The perfect injury for a contract year running back to “hold out” without holding out.. Are ekeler and saquon embellishing their ankle injuries as part of the overall running back contract discussion? What if Derrick Henry’s turf toe is him joining their quiet quitting? Is Josh Jacobs next?
