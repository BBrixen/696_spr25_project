Can I play D3 on the Switch completely offline? - Console Discussion - Diablo 3 Forums Diablo 3 Forums Can I play D3 on the Switch completely offline? Console Discussion BHU-1271 March 19, 2023,  3:37pm 1 Bit of background: I’ve been playing the D4 beta this weekend and I’m not too fond of it… I enjoy playing D3 considerably more. I hope I am wrong, but I think the writing is on the wall that Blizzard will eventually drop support for D3 entirely: it’s impossible to monetize D3 the way D:I and D4 are/will be, and micotransactions/battle passes seem to be the direction Blizzard wants to take all their games. I have been playing D3 on-and-off since release, but much more consistently in the last several years - I also played D1 and D2 when they were released, and played offline solo D2 on-and-off for well over 10 years so I have spent a long time in Sanctuary - losing D3 seasons will be sad, but losing the ability to play D3 at all will be heartbreaking. While it’s possible Blizzard may make a final offline patch for D3, that’s not something to count on, so I have decided to get a Nintendo Switch in order to always be able to scratch the D3 itch when I get it. I already picked up a physical copy of D3 for the Switch last year ($60 for ‘just in case’) but I think it’s time to actually invest in the Switch itself, before it goes to a new generation of hardware and the older physical games are no longer compatible. I dont know anything about consoles (havent played a console game since BioShock on my old Xbox) so I have a few questions for the community: Is it possible to play D3 completely offline on the Switch with a physical copy of the game? (participating in seasons is irrelevant: if Blizzard drops support of D3 there wont be any more seasons anyway…) Can I connect the Switch to a TV or Computer monitor to play on a larger screen? There are two version of the Switch currently available - the OLED and I guess the ‘standard’ version - will a physical copy of D3 be able to play on either? Thank you in advance!

Also yes, the Switch is made to connect to a TV through the dock it comes with, unless you are using the “lite” version console that doesn’t even separate joycons. 2 Likes Sephrax-2306 March 20, 2023,  4:28pm 3 Connection to server is only required for seasons. In non-season only thing you need internet connection for is multiplayer (couch coop excluded). 1 Like Archaion-1491 March 20, 2023,  9:17pm 4 Except on PC version where it is always online. This only applies to console. DeadlyMouse-1231549 March 20, 2023, 11:03pm 5 Yes, offline, as long as you do not want to play seasons as noted. 1 Like BHU-1271 March 21, 2023,  1:09pm 6 Thank you for the answers everyone! I will be ordering myself an OLED Switch today - it will be relief knowing that I will always be able to play the game I enjoy so much whenever I want, regardless of Blizzards support for it. I genuinely didnt know that all the console versions could be played offline - I legit thought that the Switch was the only one. That said, the Switch is more compact, so it will be easier to make room for. Home Categories Guidelines Terms of Service Privacy Policy Powered by Discourse , best viewed with JavaScript enabled
