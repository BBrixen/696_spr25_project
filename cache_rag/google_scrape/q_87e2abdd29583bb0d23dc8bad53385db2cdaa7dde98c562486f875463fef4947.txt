While the bundle will only be available at Walmart locations, it will include the 32GB Nintendo Switch console, a pair of Joy-Con controllers in Splatoon 2 ‘s Neon Pink and Neon Green color scheme, a special edition carrying case for the Nintendo Switch console, and a copy of Splatoon 2 . The bundle will be stocked across all Walmarts in the U.S. and Canada, but Nintendo warns that supply may be limited based on consumer demand. “Consumers in Japan and Europe have already had a strong response to Splatoon 2 bundles in their territories,” said Pierre-Paul Trepanier, Nintendo of Canada’s General Manager and Senior Director. “This exclusive Walmart bundle gives people who have been waiting to buy a Nintendo Switch a great value and incentive to get splatting.” As stated in the quote above, the Nintendo Switch Splatoon 2 Bundle was previously available in parts of EU and Japan, with North America being left out when Splatoon 2 launching on July 21st, 2017. With the Nintendo Switch already next to impossible to obtain in North America, the introduction of a bundle could make the Nintendo Switch that much harder to find in stores. Splatoon 2 is available as an exclusive for the Nintendo Switch.
