Now, Instagram makes over $49B for Meta each year.  Here's the story of Facebook's most successful acquisition:  Instagram, launched in 2010 attracted 25,000 users on the first day without spending a single dollar. In just 3 months, Instagram hit 1 million users.   By 2012, Instagram had Insane growth.  Kevin Systrom (co-founder & ex-CEO) wanted to grow Instagram as big as Google & Facebook.   Cut to April 2012, Sequoia led a series B round at $50 million, valuing the company at $500M. Meanwhile, Twitter’s $500M offer was on the table and the term sheet was sent.  But before signing the deal, Mark Zuckerberg reached out.  He wanted to buy Instagram & promised to pay double whatever Systrom raised at their funding round.   Zuckerberg knew that Instagram would turn into a big threat down the line (like Twitter).   So, he invited Systrom to his house in Palo Alto.   Zuckerberg agreed to acquire Instagram for $1 billion – cash & stock. He vowed to keep it running independently. Zuckerberg closed the deal.   The deal was hard for Facebook because it was just weeks before Facebook's IPO.  Everyone laughed at Mark for buying a company that had only 13 employees.  It was a bold move with big risks. Everyone thought Zuckerberg was insane for shelling out that much for an app acquisition.    Why did Systrom agree to Zuckerberg's deal?  He was promised:  - Access to Facebook’s infrastructure and expertise. - Stock surge boosting acquisition value. - Maintaining company independence. - Removing a Facebook competitor.  But the risk paid off. In 2023 Instagram made more than $49 billion—almost 37% of Facebook's total revenue.  Today, Instagram is one of the largest growing social media platforms in the world.   ——————————  See, as a founder, your acquisition journey can be brutal.

But Mark Zuckerberg moved faster.  He invited Instagram’s co-founder, Kevin Systrom , to his Palo Alto home for a weekend negotiation. The result? Zuckerberg offered $1 billion in cash and stock for an app that, at the time, had no revenue.  Zuckerberg promised to let Instagram operate independently, a crucial factor that sealed the deal for Systrom.  The acquisition was announced on April 9, 2012, and here’s why it mattered:  - Instagram had over 30 million users in just two years - Twitter didn’t even have time to make a serious offer - It was Facebook’s first major purchase of a product with such a large user base  Zuckerberg didn’t just want to acquire Instagram—he had a vision to integrate it without overshadowing its brand or user experience.  Now, Instagram has over 2 billion users and has become a global powerhouse. 💸  What’s in it for Startups and Entrepreneurs?  Zuckerberg’s acquisition of Instagram is a masterclass in strategic foresight. The lesson from this is clear—when you see potential, move swiftly, and think long-term.  Whether you’re the buyer or the seller, focus on maintaining the core strengths of the business while leveraging resources for growth.  Zuckerberg didn’t just buy an app—he bought into the future.

Because no one will use your product. AKA rough go-to-market.  What they don't say is you're also limiting your exit strategies.  Let's walk through an example "Super Instagram."  Your user acquisition/go-to-market will be impossible.  Your product has to be infinitely better than Instagram to break its network effect. (See TikTok)  It also has to be very hard to copy or Meta will try (see Reels… RIP)  Here is what they fail to mention - Anti Trust and Share Holder Value  Zuck bought Instagram because he realized that mobile was on the rise and FB was not well positioned for it.  In 2012, regulators didn’t blink, when the deal was announced. Today, regulators are searching for ways to sue tech companies for monopolistic practices.   That’s only ½ of why Zuck can't buy “Super Instagram” today.  FB announced its agreement to buy Instagram a month before its IPO.  Coincidence, I think not.  Most people thought Zuck was crazy for buying Instagram for $1B.  Remember, that his investors weren't most people but venture capitalists.  Their job was to invest in crazy and history shows that Zuck’s plan was genius.  In 2024, the public market is less tolerant of crazy geniuses. (See Elon Musk)   Announce a "crazy" acquisition and your share value will plummet.   Founders, your company’s potential acquirers know this.  Today, deals are being delayed and debated ad nauseam across board rooms.   Those delays kill startups that don’t have a strong enough product to grow while the board gets coffee.  Build something special, something the world needs, not wants.  Sometimes common sense advice is an underappreciated golden rule...  Bonus fun fact: Zuck also won't buy your “Super Instagram” because with tech layoffs, hiring engineers to copy your feature is now a lot cheaper.   It’s also easier to pass antitrust and shareholder-wise.

A small team was burning through cash, desperately trying to save their failing startup.  Their product? A location-based check-in app called... Burbn. (Never heard of it? Exactly.)  Late one night, exhausted and nearly broke, they made a decision that would change everything.  They looked at their user data and noticed something strange: Nobody was using their check-in feature. But people were obsessed with... sharing photos? 🤔  In that moment, Burbn died. And from its ashes, Instagram was born. Two years later? They sold to Facebook for $1 billion.  This, my friends, is the power of the pivot. But here's the million-dollar question : How do you know when it's time to pivot? And how do you do it right?  Over the years, countless startups go through this exact dilemma. Here's what I've learned: Listen to the whispers 👂 Your data is always talking. But are you listening? Instagram's founders were. The next Instagram might be hiding in your least-used feature.  Don't fall in love with your solution 💔 Fall in love with the problem you're solving. Instagram's founders weren't attached to check-ins. They were obsessed with connecting people.  Be ready to burn the boats ⛵🔥 A real pivot isn't a tweak. It's a fundamental change. It's scary. It should be. That's how you know it's worth doing. Move fast, but don't break things 🏃♂️ Unlike what Zuckerberg preached, in a pivot, you need to move fast AND keep things intact.   Your team, your core users, your vision - protect these at all costs.  Tell a new story 📖 A pivot is also a narrative shift. How you tell your new story to your team, users, and investors can make or break your pivot.

Let’s dive into 7 major acquisitions that reshaped industries and defined the future of technology. Instagram – Acquired by Meta (2012) Price: $1B Age at the time: 13 months Users: 30M Value Today: $200B+ Facebook bought Instagram for $1B when it was just an emerging photo-sharing app. Today, Instagram has evolved into one of the largest social platforms, with a massive cultural impact and 2 billion monthly active users. This early bet on a growing trend redefined social media. Android Developer – Acquired by Google (2005) Price: $50M Employees: 8 Product: Not launched Value Today: 70% of global smartphone market When Google acquired Android, it had no product and only a small team. Fast forward to today, Android is the dominant mobile operating system, powering almost 3 billion devices. Google saw potential in the mobile market, and it’s paid off massively. YouTube – Acquired by Google (2006) Price: $1.65B Age at the time: 18 months Initial Funding: $11.5M Value Today: $180B+ At the time, $1.65B seemed like a high price for a platform that was barely 2 years old. Today, YouTube is a $180B powerhouse, generating billions annually from advertising and content creation. Google’s gamble turned into a goldmine for online video. PayPal – Acquired by eBay (2002) Price: $1.5B Return: 5000% for early investors PayPal’s acquisition by eBay allowed it to scale as the primary payment solution for online shopping. Early investors saw 5000% returns, and PayPal has since grown into a $1 trillion company. A perfect example of recognizing potential in an emerging market. WhatsApp – Acquired by Meta (2014) Price: $19B Team: 50 engineers Users at the time: 450M Marketing Budget: $0 Facebook’s $19B acquisition of WhatsApp was one of the largest tech deals at the time. With 2 billion users today, WhatsApp’s zero-marketing, all-user-engagement approach shows that if people love your app, it can transform the market. Pixar Animation Studios – Acquired by Steve Jobs (1986) Price: $5M Original Purpose: Hardware company Value Today: Integral to Disney's $203B Market Cap Steve Jobs bought Pixar for just $5M, but the acquisition laid the foundation for Disney’s animation empire. From Toy Story to Frozen, Pixar revolutionized animation and is now one of the most profitable media companies in the world. LinkedIn – Acquired by Microsoft (2016) Price: $26.2B Value Today: Adds $350B+ to Microsoft’s valuation When Microsoft acquired LinkedIn for $26.2B, the deal wasn’t just about networking—it was about synergy. Integrating LinkedIn with Microsoft’s products boosted the company’s market value by more than $350B, showcasing the true power of business alignment.

It was designed to let Facebook users build a professional network on the site, competing directly with LinkedIn.  The team founded a brilliant hack that skyrocketed acquisition,  growing their user base from 4 million to 25 million in just 3 months.  Wow!  But they had a problem:  users didn’t find the app valuable and started leaving.  Their decline was so rapid that at one point, they were losing more than 4% of their monthly active users every day.  Despite raising $50 million in venture capital, BranchOut never became more than a viral one-hit wonder.  It ended its wild ride by selling its assets to an obscure human resources company for $2 million in cash and some stock.   I love this story because it’s a clear example of why retention is essential for growth.  Startups often push for growth too hard and too soon, but without an amazing product, it’s a waste of time.  Love creates growth, not the other way around.

In 2008, Twitter rejected him. In 2009, venture capitalists called him "delusional."  Fast forward to today—WhatsApp, the app he co-founded, has over 2 billion users worldwide.  Here’s his story and the lessons every professional can learn:  After 11 successful years at Yahoo, Brian decided to leave his stable job. His goal? To work at Facebook. The result: Immediate rejection.  Still determined, he tried his luck at Twitter in 2008. Once again, rejected.  It was during this time he connected with Jan Koum, a fellow ex-Yahoo employee. Both had been rejected by Facebook, but more importantly, both shared a frustration with how mobile communication worked.  From a conversation over a game of frisbee, a revolutionary idea was born:  What if they could create an app to send real-time messages for free?  At the time, mobile carriers charged users per text. This new app would make communication seamless—and affordable.  Armed with $250,000 in savings, Brian supported Jan in developing their app. They called it: WhatsApp.  The early days were tough:  The app constantly crashed.  Users: just 10.  Revenue: $0.   But in 2009, Apple launched push notifications, which transformed the app into a game-changer.  By 2011, they raised $8M from Sequoia Capital at a $25M valuation. The same investors who dismissed them in 2009 were now eager to invest.  But what truly set WhatsApp apart was its manifesto:  No ads.  No gimmicks.  No user data collection.  No marketing budget.   Brian famously said: "No one wakes up excited to see more advertising."  By 2013, WhatsApp had surpassed 200M users—with only 50 employees.  Then, Facebook came knocking again, offering a record-breaking $19 billion to acquire WhatsApp in 2014.  However, in 2018, Facebook wanted to monetize WhatsApp through ads. Staying true to his principles, Brian walked away from the company, leaving behind $850 million in unvested stock options.  Today, WhatsApp powers 100 billion messages daily and remains a symbol of innovation and simplicity.  Key Lessons from Brian Acton’s Journey:  1️⃣ Rejection is redirection. 2️⃣ Keep it simple. 3️⃣ Principles > Profits. 4️⃣ Start small, think big. 5️⃣ Stand firm on your values.  Sometimes, your greatest setbacks are setups for your biggest comebacks.  What’s your biggest takeaway from Brian Acton’s journey?
