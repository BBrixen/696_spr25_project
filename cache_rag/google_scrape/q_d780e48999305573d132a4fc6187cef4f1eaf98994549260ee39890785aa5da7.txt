The legendary Jim Thorpe, whose star status helped the game earn respect during its infancy, was named the first president of the National Football League (first known as the American Professional Football Association). Three long-time leaders of the NFL – Joe Carr, Bert Bell, and Pete Rozelle – have earned election to the Pro Football Hall of Fame for their contributions to the game. Here is a look at the men who have headed up the NFL since its founding at an automobile showroom in downtown Canton in 1920.
