Cook's pay package skyrocketed to 98.7 million dollars in 2021 – over 1,400 times that of an average Apple employee – in a move that attracted criticism from investors and shareholders alike. This marked a 567 percent surge from Cook's 2020 profit of 14.8 million and turned the Apple chief the fourth highest-paid CEO in the United States . Compensation curtailed, salary stays the same The drop in Cook's paycheck stems from an adjustment in the CEO's stock award, which will grant him an estimated 40 million dollars in 2023, down from the previous year's value of roughly 83 million. Cook's annual base salary is set to remain unchanged at three million, in addition to a bonus of up to six million. According to Apple, Cook himself recommended the cut after a shareholder vote on his pay package.
