Regarded as one of the best players in the world, he is known for his dribbling , finishing , and speed . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Born in Paris and raised in nearby Bondy , Mbappé began his senior club career in 2015 with Monaco , where he won the Ligue 1 title in the 2016–17 season . In 2017, aged 18, Mbappé signed for Paris Saint-Germain on an eventual permanent transfer worth €180 million, making him the second- most-expensive player and most expensive teenage player of all time. [ 5 ] With PSG, he won six Ligue 1 titles and four Coupes de France , including a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season , while also leading the club to its first ever UEFA Champions League final in 2020. He is the club's all-time top goalscorer , ranks third in assists , and is the seventh-highest goalscorer in Ligue 1 history . In 2024, after several years of speculation, Mbappé joined Real Madrid on a free transfer. He won the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Intercontinental Cup in the first half of his debut season, scoring in both finals. At international level, Mbappé made his senior debut for France in 2017, at age of 18. At the 2018 FIFA World Cup , Mbappé became the youngest French player to score at a World Cup, as well as the second teenager, after Pelé , to score in a World Cup final . He finished as the joint second-highest goalscorer as France won the tournament; he went on to win the FIFA World Cup Best Young Player and French Player of the Year awards for his performances. He also helped France to victory in the UEFA Nations League in 2021, receiving the top scorer award in the finals . At the 2022 FIFA World Cup , France reached the final again; Mbappé won the Golden Boot and Silver Ball and set the record for the most goals scored in World Cup final matches by scoring a hat-trick . Mbappé is one of only two players to have scored in two consecutive World Cup finals (the other being Brazil's Vavá in 1958 and 1962 ). Mbappé finished in third place for the 2023 Ballon d'Or and was runner-up for the 2022 The Best FIFA Men's Player award. He was named to the FIFA FIFPro World11 in 2018 , 2019 , 2022 and 2023 , the UEFA Team of the Year in 2018 and the UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season in 2016–17 , 2019–20 , 2020–21 and 2021–22 . He was awarded the Golden Boy in 2017, the Kopa Trophy in 2018, and was shortlisted for the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2019 and 2023. Mbappé has been named Ligue 1 Player of the Year a record five times, and has finished as the Ligue 1 top scorer for a record six seasons; in the 2021–22 season , he became the first player to finish as both Ligue 1 top scorer and top assist provider. In 2023, he was named as one of the Time ' s 100 most influential people in the world , and was ranked third on the Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes . Early life Kylian Mbappé Lottin [ 6 ] was born on 20 December 1998 [ 7 ] in the 19th arrondissement of Paris [ 8 ] and was raised in Bondy , Seine-Saint-Denis , in the northeastern suburbs of Paris . [ 9 ] His father, Wilfrid Mbappé [ fr ] , is a football coach and is originally from the Cameroonian island of Djébalè [ fr ] , [ 10 ] which is home to the Sawa people . His mother and agent , Fayza Lamari [ fr ] , is of Algerian Kabyle origin and is a former handball player. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] He has a younger brother, Ethan , who plays for Lille . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Their older adoptive brother, Jirès Kembo Ekoko , is a former professional footballer. [ 17 ] As a child, Mbappé went to a private Catholic school in Bondy, where he was considered academically gifted but unruly. [ 18 ] At 15, he began taking Spanish lessons, and eventually became fluent in the language. [ 19 ] Among Mbappé's idols growing up were Zinedine Zidane , [ 20 ] Cristiano Ronaldo , [ 21 ] Neymar , [ 22 ] Ronaldinho , [ 23 ] Lionel Messi , [ 22 ] Ronaldo Nazario , [ 24 ] Eden Hazard [ 25 ] and Thierry Henry . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] As a child, Mbappé received Robinho 's AC Milan shirt as a gift from his nanny's family, who were Italians and supporters of the club. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] However, his own favourite team had always been Real Madrid . [ 30 ] In May 2024, just days before his transfer to Real Madrid was announced, Mbappé said that he still follows Serie A and AC Milan, and would like to play for the Rossoneri if he is ever to move to Italy in the future. [ 31 ] Club career Early career Mbappé was coached by his father, Wilfried, when he started his career with AS Bondy. Another of his youth coaches at AS Bondy, Antonio Riccardi, stated, The first time I coached him was when he was six years old. You could tell he was different. Kylian could do much more than the other children. His dribbling was already fantastic and he was much faster than the others. He was the best player I've ever seen in 15 years coaching here. In Paris, there are many talents but I'd never seen a talent like him. He was what we call a 'crack' (the best). [ 32 ] Eventually, Mbappé moved to the Clairefontaine academy, putting in a host of impressive performances leading to numerous French clubs, and Real Madrid , Chelsea , Liverpool , Manchester City and Bayern Munich , attempting to sign him. [ 14 ] At the age of 11, Real Madrid invited him to train with their under-12s and visit the club's facilities. [ 33 ] Mbappé was tracked by Caen for three years, but their relegation from Ligue 1 in 2012 and subsequent failure to win promotion meant that they could not afford his signature. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] At age 14, he travelled to London after an invite from Chelsea, playing a match for their youth team against Charlton Athletic . [ 36 ] Monaco In July 2013, at the age of 14, Mbappé joined the youth academy of Monaco , signing a three-year contract. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] The club had beat competition from Real Madrid and Zinedine Zidane , who was "very involved" in efforts to sign him. [ 39 ] 2015–2017: Breakthrough and league title In October 2015, Mbappé was brought in by Leonardo Jardim to be a mainstay in Monaco's reserve team , but his level of skill and maturity prompted his promotion to the main squad after just three weeks. [ 40 ] He made his first-team debut two months later, on 2 December 2015, in a 1–1 Ligue 1 home draw against Caen , replacing Fábio Coentrão after 88 minutes. Mbappé therefore became Monaco's youngest-ever first-team player, aged 16 years and 347 days, breaking the previous record set by Thierry Henry in 1994. [ 37 ] [ 41 ] On 20 February 2016, Mbappé scored his first goal for the club's first team, a stoppage-time goal in a 3–1 league win over Troyes at the Stade Louis II ; at the age of 17 years and 62 days, he became the youngest first-team goalscorer in Monaco's history – once again displacing Henry in the process. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] On 6 March 2016, Mbappé signed his first professional contract, a three-year deal, tying him to Monaco until June 2019. [ 44 ] In an interview with CNN , Vadim Vasilyev , Monaco's vice-president, stated that he knew early on that Mbappé was a "phenomenon". [ 45 ] Mbappé warming up for Monaco in 2017 Mbappé scored the first hat-trick of his first-team career on 14 December 2016, in a 7–0 home win over Rennes in the Coupe de la Ligue round of 16 – the first hat-trick scored by any Monaco player in the competition since Sonny Anderson in 1997. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 41 ] On 11 February 2017, Mbappé scored the first Ligue 1 hat-trick of his career in a 5–0 home win over Metz ; at 18 years and two months, he became the youngest player to score a league hat-trick since Jérémy Ménez did so for Sochaux back in 2005. [ 48 ] On 21 February, Mbappé scored Monaco's second goal in the 40th minute of a 5–3 loss away to Manchester City in the UEFA Champions League round of 16. It was his first European-competition goal, and he became the second-youngest French scorer in Champions League history, behind only Karim Benzema . [ 49 ] [ 50 ] On 5 March, Mbappé scored two first-half goals in a 4–0 home win over Nantes to bring his Ligue 1 career tally to ten goals, becoming the youngest player in the previous thirty years to reach the ten-goal mark in the league. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] On 11 March, he scored a goal in a 2–1 home win over Bordeaux , registering his seventh goal in his previous four league starts. [ 53 ] On 15 March 2017, Mbappé scored Monaco's opening goal in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 tie with Manchester City. Monaco went on to win 3–1, and with the aggregate score being tied 6–6, advanced to the quarter-finals thanks to the away goals rule . [ 54 ] In the quarter-finals against Borussia Dortmund , Mbappé won a penalty and scored two goals as Monaco won the first leg 3–2 at the Westfalenstadion . [ 55 ] In the second leg at home, he opened the scoring as Monaco won 3–1 and advanced to the semi-finals. [ 56 ] They were eventually eliminated from the Champions League following a 4–1 loss on aggregate to Juventus , with Mbappé scoring his team's lone goal in the second leg. [ 57 ] Mbappé ended the 2016–17 season with 26 goals from 44 matches in all competitions, as Monaco won the Ligue 1 title. [ 58 ] He credited fellow Monaco striker Radamel Falcao as a key influence on him throughout the season, giving him the space to express himself and teaching him to be "calm" and "serene" during the game. [ 59 ] Paris Saint-Germain 2017–2020: Record transfer and immediate success On 31 August 2017, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) announced the signing of Mbappé from Monaco on loan with a mandatory purchase option of €180 million. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] According to PSG's assistant sporting director Luis Ferrer, the shift in Mbappé's decision to join the club was partly thanks to a "convincing" speech given by manager Unai Emery at the Mbappés' home over the summer. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] The €180 million fee made Mbappé the most expensive teenager ever and the second-most-expensive player ever (behind teammate Neymar ), and broke the record for the largest transfer within a domestic league. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] He was handed the number 29 shirt upon arrival in the French capital. [ 69 ] On 8 September 2017, Mbappé made his PSG debut in a 5–1 Ligue 1 win away at Metz, scoring a goal. [ 70 ] Four days later, he recorded his first European goal for the club in a 5–0 UEFA Champions League group stage away defeat of Celtic . [ 71 ] He starred in PSG's 3–0 victory over Bayern Munich in the second group game of the Champions League, setting up goals for Edinson Cavani and Neymar, the latter seeing him taking out a defender with a feint by rolling the ball under his foot. [ 72 ] On 6 December, Mbappé scored his tenth career Champions League goal in a 3–1 defeat to Bayern Munich, becoming the youngest player to reach that mark, at the age of 18 years and 11 months. [ 73 ] Having already won his first league title with the club, on 8 May 2018, Mbappé featured in PSG's 2–0 win over Les Herbiers in the Coupe de France final. [ 74 ] In July 2018, Mbappé was given the number 7 jersey for the upcoming season with PSG, taking up the squad number left vacant by Lucas Moura . [ 75 ] Sporting the hashtag #K7LIAN, Mbappé stated, "I keep trying to progress on the pitch and I think that, for me, it was the right time to change number. It is something of an affirmation. The No. 7 shirt is a legendary one and many greats have worn it. I hope that I will be able to do this number justice on the pitch." [ 75 ] In his first appearance of the season, Mbappé scored twice in the last 10 minutes as PSG won 3–1 against Guingamp in Ligue 1. [ 76 ] In the following league game, the front three of Mbappé, Cavani and Neymar all scored in a 3–1 win over Angers at home, with Mbappé – starting his first game of the season – scoring from a volley and setting up Neymar to score the third. [ 77 ] On 1 September, he scored and assisted in a 4–2 away win over Nîmes , but was sent off for the first time in his career with a straight red card in injury time, after shoving Téji Savanier in retaliation for a late challenge from behind, for which Savanier was also sent off. [ 78 ] Regarding his sending-off, Mbappé told reporters after the match, "If I had the chance to do it over again, I would do the same thing. I will apologise to the supporters and everybody, but I cannot tolerate this sort of thing." [ 79 ] On 8 October, Mbappé scored four goals in just 13 minutes in a 5–0 home victory over Lyon and became the youngest player (at 19 years and 9 months) to score four goals in one game in Ligue 1 over the last forty-five seasons. [ 80 ] On 3 December, Mbappé was the inaugural winner of the Kopa Trophy , which is awarded by France Football to the best under-21 player in the world. [ 81 ] On 19 January 2019, Mbappé was one of two players (the other being Cavani) to score a hat-trick in a 9–0 win over Guingamp, breaking a record PSG had set the previous season. [ 82 ] On 12 February, he scored a goal in a 2–0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford in the Champions League round of 16. [ 83 ] On 2 March, he scored twice in a 2–1 away win over Caen to reach his 50th goal with the club. [ 84 ] On 6 March, PSG lost 3–1 at home against Manchester United and was subsequently knocked out from the Champions League on the away goals rule. [ 85 ] On 21 April, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 win against Monaco, netting his first goals against his former club. [ 86 ] PSG finished the season as Ligue 1 champions, [ 87 ] with Mbappé winning the Player of the Year award, [ 88 ] while also finishing the season as the top goalscorer with 33 goals. [ 87 ] On 3 August 2019, Mbappé scored in a 2–1 win over Rennes to capture his first title of the 2019–20 season, the Trophée des Champions . [ 89 ] He then scored again in PSG's opening Ligue 1 match of the season, a 3–0 home win over Nîmes on 11 August. [ 90 ] On 22 October, he came off the bench and scored a perfect hat-trick in a 5–0 away win over Belgian side Club Brugge in the Champions League; [ 91 ] at the age of 20 years and 306 days, he became the youngest player ever to score at least 15 goals in the competition. [ 92 ] On 1 May 2020, PSG were crowned Ligue 1 champions after the season had been called off amid the COVID-19 pandemic ; at the time of the league's premature suspension, PSG were in first place, with a twelve–point lead over second–placed Marseille . [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Mbappé finished the 2019–20 season as joint-top scorer in Ligue 1 with 18 goals, along with Monaco's Wissam Ben Yedder ; however, Mbappé was assigned the title due to his higher goals-per-game ratio. [ 95 ] On 24 July, in the Coupe de France final against Saint-Étienne , Mbappé was forced off after sustaining an injury following a challenge from Loïc Perrin , who was sent off; PSG won the match 1–0, [ 96 ] although Mbappé was ruled out of the Coupe de la Ligue final , [ 97 ] which PSG went on to win, completing a domestic treble . [ 98 ] He returned to action in the Champions League quarter-final against Atalanta on 12 August, coming on a substitute, and assisting Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting 's match–winning goal in injury time. [ 99 ] PSG eventually suffered a 1–0 loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League final on 23 August. [ 100 ] 2020–2022: Further triumphs and contract extension Mbappé missed the first three matches of the season after contracting COVID-19 while being on international duty. [ 101 ] He returned to action on 20 September 2020, in a 3–0 away win against Nice , and scored a goal from a penalty kick. [ 102 ] On 28 October, Mbappé recorded two assists, both for Moise Kean , in a 2–0 Champions League group stage victory against İstanbul Başakşehir . [ 103 ] In doing so, he became the player with the most assists in the competition since the beginning of the 2017–18 edition , with his tally adding up to fourteen over the four seasons. [ 104 ] In a Ligue 1 match against Montpellier on 5 December, Mbappé scored his 100th goal for PSG, becoming only the fifth player to achieve the feat for the Parisian club. [ 105 ] In his side's final Champions League group match, Mbappé scored his first two goals of the European campaign against Başakşehir, as PSG won 5–1 and qualified for the knockout phase as group winners. [ 106 ] He also became the youngest player in Champions League history to reach twenty goals (although this record would then be surpassed by Erling Haaland later on in the same season). [ 107 ] [ 108 ] On 16 February 2021, Mbappé became only the third player, after Faustino Asprilla and Andriy Shevchenko , to score a Champions League hat-trick against Barcelona , doing so in PSG's 4–1 round of 16 win at the Camp Nou . [ 109 ] Mbappé's hat-trick also saw him overtake Pauleta 's total of 109 goals to become PSG's third-highest scorer , with only Cavani (200 goals) and Zlatan Ibrahimović (156 goals) getting more for the club. [ 110 ] On 27 February, Mbappé scored twice in a 4–0 away win against Dijon , becoming the first player to score five braces in the Ligue 1 season. [ 111 ] In the second leg against Barcelona on 10 March, Mbappé scored from the spot in a 1–1 draw at the Parc de Princes, as his side advanced to the quarter-finals 5–2 on aggregate. [ 112 ] Mbappé's penalty was his 25th Champions League goal, surpassing opponent Lionel Messi as the youngest player to reach this milestone, at 22 years and 80 days. Adding to his hat-trick from the first leg, Mbappé additionally became the first player to score four goals against Barcelona in a single Champions League season. [ 113 ] In the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich on 7 April, Mbappé scored two goals, helping his team to a 3–2 win at the Allianz Arena , PSG's first victory in Munich since 1994. [ 114 ] The French club later progressed to the semi-finals to be eventually eliminated by Manchester City: the forward missed the second leg due to a calf injury. [ 115 ] On 19 May, Mbappé scored once and assisted the second in the Coupe de France final against his former club Monaco, as PSG won 2–0 to claim their first major trophy of the season. [ 116 ] He ended the Ligue 1 campaign with 27 goals, becoming the top scorer for the third consecutive season, although PSG missed out on the Ligue 1 title – it was the first time in Mbappé's career where he did not win the league after four consecutive successes. [ 117 ] [ 118 ] Mbappé ended the season by receiving the Ligue 1 Player of the Year award and being included in the Ligue 1 Team of the Season. [ 119 ] Left-to-right: Mbappé, Lionel Messi and Neymar playing against Marseille in Le Classique , October 2021 On 14 August 2021, prior to Paris Saint-Germain's opening home match of the 2021–22 season against Strasbourg , Mbappé was booed by the Parc des Princes amidst rumours that he wanted to sign for Spanish club Real Madrid. [ 120 ] The match ended in a 4–2 victory for the Parisians, with the forward setting up three of his team's goals. [ 121 ] He scored his first goal of the season in a 4–2 away win against Brest six days later. [ 122 ] In the following match against Reims on 29 August, in which Lionel Messi notably made his debut for PSG, Mbappé scored a brace in a 2–0 Rouge-et-Bleu victory. [ 123 ] On 24 November, he scored in a 2–1 Champions League defeat to Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium . [ 124 ] On 7 December, he scored two goals in a 4–1 Champions League home win over Club Brugge. The goals, which were his 30th and 31st in the Champions League, made him the youngest player to reach this milestone in the history of the competition. [ 125 ] On 12 December 2021, Mbappé scored twice against Monaco in Ligue 1 to reach a century of league goals for PSG . At 22 years and 357 days old, he became the youngest player to score 100 goals for a single team in the French top-flight since Opta began recording data in the 1950–51 season . [ 126 ] On 3 January 2022, Mbappé scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 4–0 Coupe de France win over Vannes . [ 127 ] On 11 February, he scored the winning goal in stoppage time in a 1–0 league win over Rennes, [ 128 ] a feat he repeated four days later, in a 1–0 Champions League victory over Real Madrid in the first leg of the round of 16. [ 129 ] He scored another goal in the second leg, making him the second-highest goalscorer in Paris Saint-Germain's history; however, his team was knocked out following a 3–1 defeat at the Santiago Bernabéu . [ 130 ] [ 131 ] On 21 May 2022, Mbappé extended his contract with PSG until 2025, [ 132 ] despite speculations of a possible transfer to Real Madrid, [ 133 ] which prompted La Liga officials to file a complaint to UEFA regarding accumulating losses of PSG in the previous years. [ 134 ] Mbappé himself reportedly called and spoke to Real Madrid's president Florentino Pérez , telling him that he would not be signing for Real Madrid. [ 135 ] According to Sky Sports , the financial details of Mbappé's contract included a monthly wage of £4 million, making him the highest-paid player in the world. [ 136 ] Mbappé and PSG also reportedly secured a signing-on figure in the region of £100 million. [ 136 ] In the hours following the forward's contract extension, he scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win over Metz, to finish the season with 28 goals as top scorer for the fourth consecutive season. [ 137 ] He became the third player to finish as Ligue 1's top scorer for four seasons in a row. Mbappé also provided 17 assists in the season, becoming the first player to finish as both top scorer and top assist provider in the league's history. [ 138 ] [ 139 ] 2022–2024: All-time club goalscorer and final seasons Mbappé (right) celebrating a goal with PSG teammates Messi (left) and Neymar (middle) On 13 August 2022, Mbappé scored his first goal of the season for PSG in a 5–2 home victory over Montpellier, after having missed a penalty earlier in the match. [ 140 ] Eight days later, he scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 7–1 away win over Lille. [ 141 ] His first goal in the match was clocked at eight seconds, making it the second-fastest goal ever scored in Ligue 1 history, tenths of seconds later than Michel Rio 's goal for Caen against Cannes in 1992. [ 142 ] On 6 September, Mbappé scored a brace in PSG's opening Champions League fixture against Juventus, securing a 2–1 home victory for the Parisians. [ 143 ] On 11 October, he scored a penalty in a 1–1 Champions League draw at home to Benfica , becoming the leading goal scorer for PSG in European competitions with 31 goals. [ 144 ] However, the match was played in the backdrop of media reports that Mbappé wanted to leave PSG in the January transfer window , rumours which he denied, saying, "I'm very happy. I never asked for my departure in January." [ 145 ] On 23 January 2023, Mbappé became the first PSG player to score five goals in a match, including a ten-minute hat-trick, in a 7–0 rout of Pays de Cassel in the Coupe de France round of 32. [ 146 ] On 26 February, he scored two goals and assisted another as PSG defeated Marseille 3–0 in Le Classique . He thus became the club's joint all-time top goal scorer with 200 goals, equalizing Edinson Cavani's record. [ 147 ] In the following match, a 4–2 win over Nantes, he scored his 201st goal for PSG, taking the throne as the club's leading scorer. [ 148 ] He ended the Ligue 1 campaign with 29 goals, to become the top scorer for the fifth consecutive season as PSG won their record 11th Ligue 1 title.
