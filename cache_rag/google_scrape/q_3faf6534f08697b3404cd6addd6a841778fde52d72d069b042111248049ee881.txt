She's leaving as the 2021 U.S. Open women's singles champion. Not only that, but she also rolled through the tournament without dropping a set. It was a dominant display by the 18-year-old from Great Britain, who was not expected to win a Grand Slam title this early in her professional tennis career. After all, she had only made her debut at a major tournament earlier this summer when she reached the fourth round at Wimbledon. Yet Raducanu stormed through the U.S. Open, finishing with a victory against Leylah Fernandez, a fellow unseeded teenager, in Saturday's final. Raducanu won 6-4, 6-3 to become the second teenager in three years to win this event. (Bianca Andreescu was 19 when she won in 2019).

Fernandez had played in only six previous majors and had never made it past the third round. However, the Canadian proved to be a strong player throughout her tournament run. She knocked out three players who were seeded in the top five (Sabalenka, Osaka and Svitolina), and she continued to find ways to pull out victories in close games, going a full three sets in four straight matches prior to the final. It seemed like Fernandez was finally going to be the first player to win a set against Raducanu. Yet not even she could halt the Brit's momentum. Raducanu surprised everybody at the U.S. Open‚Äîincluding herself. "You say, 'I want to win a Grand Slam.' But to have the belief I did, and actually executing, winning a Grand Slam," Raducanu said, per Howard Fendrich of the Associated Press, "I can't believe it." How rare is it for somebody to win the U.S. Open women's singles title without dropping a set along the way? It hadn't happened since 2014, when Serena Williams did it, putting Raducanu in some pretty elite company. Before Andreescu's triumph, the previous woman this young to win a U.S. Open title was Maria Sharapova, who was 19 when she captured the championship in 2006. And there hadn't been a British woman win a major tournament since Virginia Wade won Wimbledon in 1977. Raducanu kept her composure throughout her run. She never even had to play a tiebreaker. None of her opponents won more than four games in a single set. It was complete dominance. Saturday's final wasn't the first time Raducanu had played against Fernandez. The two met at the 2018 Wimbledon junior tournament, with the Brit coming out on top then too. The 2021 U.S. Open final may not be the final meeting between the pair, either. "I hope we play each other in many more tournaments and hopefully finals," Raducanu said, per ESPN's¬†Aishwarya Kumar . Not only is it possible that may happen, but these teenagers could be the future of women's tennis as well. And given the quality on display Saturday, that would be nothing but positive for the sport. 04:50 NBA Comps for Top Bigs üë• TOP NEWS Post-Draft NFL Power Rankings Bleacher Report 14h NFL Draft Picks We Wanted to See üëÄ Bleacher Report 14h Latest Projections and Pro Comps ‚úçÔ∏è Bleacher Report 14h Ranking Top 10 Free Agents Post-Draft Bleacher Report 14h Way-Too-Early 2026 Mock Draft Bleacher Report 1d TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 10h Russini Says She Never Got Intel Browns Ranked Shedeur Sanders High on Draft Board Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d WWE Raw Results, Winners, Live Grades, Reaction, Highlights from April 28 ‚öîÔ∏è Jey, Logan Paul on collision course  üçø Ripley and Perez put on a show üì≤ Tap for full results and analysis Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 11h Shedeur Sanders Reportedly Was Top QB on Giants' Board After Cam Ward Ahead of Draft Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d 1 Trade Every NBA Playoff Team Wishes It Could Make Right Now Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 7h Michael Porter Jr. Not Suspended for Leaving Bench During Nuggets-Clippers Skirmish Michael Porter Jr. not suspended Game 5 for leaving bench during skirmish TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 10h Russini Says She Never Got Intel Browns Ranked Shedeur Sanders High on Draft Board Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d WWE Raw Results, Winners, Live Grades, Reaction, Highlights from April 28 ‚öîÔ∏è Jey, Logan Paul on collision course  üçø Ripley and Perez put on a show üì≤ Tap for full results and analysis Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 11h Shedeur Sanders Reportedly Was Top QB on Giants' Board After Cam Ward Ahead of Draft Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d 1 Trade Every NBA Playoff Team Wishes It Could Make Right Now Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 7h Michael Porter Jr. Not Suspended for Leaving Bench During Nuggets-Clippers Skirmish Michael Porter Jr. not suspended Game 5 for leaving bench during skirmish Bleacher Report About Advertise Contact Us Get Help Careers Sitemap Community Guidelines Privacy Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information Terms Of Use AdChoices B/R Sports on MAX B/R Creators Program Copyright ¬© 2025 Bleacher Report, Inc.
