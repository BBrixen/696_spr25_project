"In the spirit of African brotherhood, and Nigeria, especially with her cordial relationship with South Africa, the federal government has withdrawn from the bid of the 2010 World Cup fiesta and lends its full support to South Africa," the sports minister Musa Mohammed told a news conference yesterday. He added that Nigeria is overburdened by hosting other commitments, namely the All Africa Games in October and the Commonwealth heads of governments meeting in December. The Nigerians had been due to present their bid to Fifa, along with South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, in Zurich today. The South Africans, the clear favourites since narrowly losing the 2006 World Cup bid to Germany, were delighted with the Nigerian decision. "It's great news for South Africa and our bid," the South Africa bid chief Danny Jordaan declared yesterday. "More important than Nigeria backing out is the fact that they have given us their support because they are extremely influential in West Africa and they will be able to consolidate a large amount of support behind our bid." In 2000, the Nigerians also withdrew their bid to host the 2006 World Cup and threw their weight behind the South African campaign. Fifa has said Africa will host football's showpiece event for the first time in 2010 as part of a new policy of rotating the finals between continents.
