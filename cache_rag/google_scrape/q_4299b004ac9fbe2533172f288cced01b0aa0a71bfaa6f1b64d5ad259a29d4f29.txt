Christiansen is an Influencer CEO of the LEGO Group 3y Report this post 2021 is coming to an end. For our colleagues and our company, it has been yet another extraordinary year. I am proud of how we have developed amazing play experiences, overcome challenges in our Supply Chain and excited children and fans in countries across the world. I am also proud of how our success enables us to make a positive impact for children and families through The LEGO Foundation and through the many activities we engage in, supporting communities, families, and children in need. My hope and wish for 2022 is that we all continue to make a positive impact. As companies on society and the planet. And as individuals on those we meet and interact with throughout the year – be it family, friends, or colleagues. I send you all the warmest Season’s Greetings and wishes for a Happy New Year! 1,242 15 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Aaron Burciaga, CAP-Expert, ACE Co-Founder & CEO @ ZetAI | Managed Artificial Intelligence Service Provider 3y Report this comment Incredible!  Also, a happy new year to you.  The LEGO foundation continues to have a significant impact on the lives of children today and in the future.  These toys have aided in the teaching of creativity and problem-solving skills, as well as the development of imagination while having fun. When given the same basic pieces to work with, it's astonishing to see how many distinct models people can come up with.  One of the things I admire about them is that, in addition to their imaginative play products, they are involved in community activities, environmental projects, and offering possibilities for children through play. You're all incredible.  I wish you all the best in the coming year.

Happy New year to you too!  The LEGO foundation continues to make a great impact in children's life from today and beyond. These toys have played a big role in teaching creativity and problem solving skills as well as enhancing imagination while having fun at the same time. It is amazing to see all the different models people create when they are given the same basic pieces to work with.  One thing I love about them is that although they are known for their creative play materials, they are also involved in areas such as community activities, environmental projects, and providing opportunities for children through play. You all are amazing!  Wishing you the best in the new year. Like Reply 1 Reaction Yu Qiang 玉强 Hisense 海信 Sales Director _Hisense HVAC 3y Report this comment Hi Sir.
