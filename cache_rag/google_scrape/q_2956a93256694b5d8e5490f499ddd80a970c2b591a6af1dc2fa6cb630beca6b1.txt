Developed for television by Frank Darabont , who wrote or co-wrote four of the season's six episodes and directed the pilot episode, " Days Gone Bye ", the series is based on the eponymous series of comic books by Robert Kirkman , Tony Moore , and Charlie Adlard . [ 1 ] It was executive produced by Darabont, Kirkman, David Alpert, Charles H. Eglee , and Gale Anne Hurd , with Darabont assuming the role of showrunner . This season adapts material from issues #1–6 of the comic book series and introduces notable comic character Rick Grimes ( Andrew Lincoln ), who awakens from a coma , after being shot, in a post-apocalyptic world filled with flesh-eating zombies , dubbed "walkers". After befriending Morgan Jones ( Lennie James ), Rick sets out to find his family and discover the origins of the walker virus. The season received very positive reviews by critics. It was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama at the 68th Golden Globe Awards [ 2 ] and received nominations for the 63rd Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards in several categories, winning Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie, or Special . [ 3 ] The pilot episode received 5.35 million viewers, and the finale garnered six million viewers, including four million viewers among adults ages 18–49, making it the most viewed basic cable drama series at that time. [ 4 ] Based on its reception, AMC renewed the series for a second season consisting of 13 episodes, which premiered on October 16, 2011. [ 5 ] Production [ edit ] Conception [ edit ] A set-up of The Walking Dead at San Diego Comic-Con in 2010 Robert Kirkman , who created the comic book series in 2003, [ 6 ] says he had considered the idea of a Walking Dead television series, but never actively pursued it. "I certainly wanted it to happen, just because I knew it would be good for the book... I'm certainly not against adaptations, like some creators." [ 7 ] When Frank Darabont became interested in adapting the comic books for television, Kirkman said it was "extremely flattering" and went on to say that, "He definitely cares about the original source material, and you can tell that in the way he's adapting it. It's an extreme validation of the work... Never in a million years could I have thought that if Walking Dead were to ever be adapted that everything would be going this well. I think that that's all because of Frank." [ 7 ] Darabont himself had been a fan of the zombie genre since seeing George A. Romero 's 1968 film Night of the Living Dead when he was fourteen years old. [ 8 ] ""Night of the Living Dead" had this weird vibe that was almost - it was like pornography... It had this marvelously attractive, disreputable draw... I loved it immediately." [ 9 ] Darabont recalls walking into a comic book store in Burbank, California and seeing The Walking Dead on the shelf in 2005. "Being that I've always had "the love of zombies genre," I of course grabbed it, took it home and read it, and immediately started pursuing the rights to it. I thought it would make a great TV show... I loved the idea of an extended, ongoing, serialized dramatic presentation set in the zombie apocalypse." [ 9 ] He described the process of developing the series and getting it set up at a network as "four years of frustration," and credits executive producer Gale Anne Hurd with finally getting the series on AMC . "I can't remember what the hell prompted her to read it [the script], but she said, "Wow, I really love this pilot you wrote. What are you doing with it?" I said I'd been trying to set it up forever... She said "I think AMC might be the place to take this." She did, and then bam! They were immediately interested. I had to credit Gale, her insight into marrying the material and the buyer." [ 9 ] Writing [ edit ] Darabont's original pilot script was split in half and embellished, making the first two episodes instead of one, "...just to slow the narrative down and dig into the characters more deeply, so it's not just plot-driven, event-driven stuff. You really want to drag these characters into the equation." [ 9 ] To write the remaining episodes of the season, Darabont recruited Charles H. Eglee , Adam Fierro and Glen Mazzara , all of whom he had worked with while directing an episode of The Shield . Jack LoGiudice also joined the writing team, along with Robert Kirkman, also an executive producer. "I have the best of both worlds", says Kirkman. "It was a lot of fun writing Episode 104, and I'm hoping if it continues into Season 2, I'll be able to write more episodes". [ 7 ] Filming [ edit ] Principal photography for the pilot episode, " Days Gone Bye ", began on May 15, 2010 [ 10 ] with the subsequent five episodes beginning filming a few weeks later on June 2. [ 11 ] The first season was filmed in and around Atlanta , Georgia where the episodes were primarily set.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] Michael Rooker as Merle Dixon , former military and drug dealer and Daryl's racist, volatile and unreasonable older brother, who is also a hunter.

[ 40 ] He was wanted to be Rick Grimes . [ 41 ] He was also in talks with Darabont to possibly guest star on the series. [ 42 ] Laurie Holden also appeared in the 2001 film The Majestic (she played Adele Stanton, Jim Carrey 's love interest), which Darabont directed. DeMunn has additionally appeared in several of Darabont's films, in addition to The Mist and The Majestic : The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and The Green Mile (1999). Promotion [ edit ] The show's official website released a motion comic based on the first issue of the original comic and voiced by Phil LaMarr . [ 43 ] The site also posted a making-of documentary primarily about the first episode, as well as a number of other behind-the-scenes videos and interviews. In the documentary, comic series creator and show executive producer Robert Kirkman as well as artist Charlie Adlard expressed that they were pleased with how faithful the show is to the comic and remark on the similarities between the actors and the comic's original character drawings. [ 44 ] Several scenes from " Days Gone Bye " were screened July 23, 2010 as part of the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con . [ 45 ] Hurd asserted that "[they] really are doing six one-hour movie", [ 46 ] and Darabont insisted that the series would closely reflect the development in the comics. "The path is a very strong template. But we're going to take every interesting detour we feel like taking. As long as were staying on the path of what Robert has done, I don't see any reason not to. If they have patience we'll eventually catch up to what Robert is doing". [ 46 ] The Walking Dead debuted during the same week in 120 countries. " Days Gone Bye " premiered in Hong Kong on TVB Pearl on August 30, 2011, [ 47 ] while it expanded in international markets during the first week of November. [ 48 ] Two weeks prior to its official premiere in the United States, the contents of the episode leaked online. [ 49 ] As part of an expansive campaign to advertise and heighten anticipation for the premiere, international broadcasting affiliates of AMC and Fox coordinated a worldwide zombie invasion event proceeding days prior to premiere of the episode in the United States. The event occurred in twenty six cities worldwide, [ 50 ] and were hosted in select locations including the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City , Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. , Palace of Westminster in London , Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul , Acropolis of Athens in Athens , and the Museo del Prado in Madrid . [ 50 ] [ 51 ] The campaign events commenced in Hong Kong and Taipei , and culminated in Los Angeles . [ 51 ] The Walking Dead was included on the cover of the December 2010 edition of Entertainment Weekly , which featured Rick Grimes pointing a gun at a horde of walkers. [ 52 ] According to the journalist of the magazine, it "examines the past, present, and future" of the television franchise; "from the comic book's humble beginnings, to unlikely path to the small screen, to even more unlikely path as a bona fide hit". [ 52 ] Kirkman was ecstatic upon hearing of the news. "I've got to say—not to kiss your magazine's a– or anything—but when they called me and said Frank [Darabont] wanted to do the show, I was like, 'Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.' And then when AMC was like, 'We're picking up the show,' I was like, 'Yeah, alright, whatever.' When they actually started shooting the pilot I was like, 'Well, this is kind of real, this is neat.' But when they called me and said, 'Your show's on the cover of Entertainment Weekly ,' I think that was the first time I was like, 'Oh my god, I can't believe this is happening to me!'"

[ 62 ] Following the second episode, Simon Abrams from Slant Magazine awarded the show three and a half stars out of a possible four; "To say that Darabont has kicked his series off with a bang would be a serious understatement ... [he] has fashioned a fully realized alternate reality and it's a thrilling thing to experience."

[ 65 ] Some reviews were mixed, including one from Kofi Outlaw of Screen Rant who concluded, "The Walking Dead still hasn't really defined itself as anything more than a vague survival story about the human condition" but added, "you can be sure I'm one of those Dead-heads already chomping at the bit for season 2". [ 66 ] Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic also offered mixed criticism saying the first season "had its ups and downs" noting that the second season should focus on "a more specific story arc and strengthening of the character development". [ 67 ] Logan Hill of New York magazine was more critical, claiming the episodes contained "atrocious dialogue" and "a lot of plot machinery that has been contrived to create action suspense but ... hasn't really moved the story itself anywhere in particular", though he admits the fifth episode showed "flashes of promise".
