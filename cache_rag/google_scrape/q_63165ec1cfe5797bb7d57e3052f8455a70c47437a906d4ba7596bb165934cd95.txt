The 32 national teams involved in the tournament were required to register a squad of 23 players, including three goalkeepers. [ 1 ] Only players in these squads were eligible to take part in the tournament. A provisional list of 30 players per national team was submitted to FIFA by 13 May 2014. [ 1 ] FIFA published the 30-player provisional lists on their website on 16 May 2014. [ 2 ] The final lists of 23 players per national team were submitted to FIFA by 2 June 2014. [ 1 ] FIFA published the 23-player final lists, with the squad numbers, on their website, on 5 June 2014. [ 3 ] Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game. [ 1 ] The age listed for each player is on 12 June 2014, the first day of the tournament. The number of caps listed for each player does not include any matches played after the start of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The club listed is the club for which the player last played a competitive match prior to the tournament. The nationality for each club reflects the national association (not the league) to which the club is affiliated. The Netherlands was the only team to use all of its 23 players during the tournament, making it the fourth team in World Cup history to ever use all of its players in the squad, after France in 1978 , and both Greece and Russia in 1994 (although in all these cases 22 players were used since the 23-player squads were not introduced until 2002 FIFA World Cup ).
