Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I cover men's and women's golf in Europe and across the world. Apr 02, 2020, 05:23am EDT Share Save This article is more than 5 years old. Current Open champion Shane Lowry may find himself holding on to the Claret Jug longer than he ... More expected. (Photo by Stuart Franklin/Getty Images) Getty Images This post has been updated. Reports suggest that this year’s Open at Royal St George’s will be canceled rather than postponed. Unlike the Masters and PGA Championship, which have already been adjourned from their April and May dates respectively, Golf Digest is reporting that the R&A is planning to cancel for insurance reasons. Quoting an anonymous source, Golf Digest explains that, like the Wimbledon tennis championship, the Open’s policy protects against a global pandemic and would need official abandonment by a certain date. “The R&A is the most (insured) of all the tournaments,” the source was quoted saying. “They have complete cancellation insurance. I just don’t see any golf (being played) before August.” A further complication for organizers is that this year’s championship was set to be the 149th, permitting next year’s journey to the Old Course in St Andrews, the home of golf, to become a grand celebration of the 150th edition. The Golf Digest article suggested that there would be no change to the rota, which would make Royal Liverpool in 2022 the 150th Open, but it did not state in outright terms that this opinion came from the source.

Should there be no Open this year it will be the first time since World War II that the championship has been uncontested. If the English town of Sandwich does miss out on hosting an Open it will represent a huge blow to the wider community. Last year it was estimated there was an economic benefit to Northern Ireland of £100 million when the tournament returned to Royal Portrush. Realistically, the excitement of the 150th Open being in St Andrew's would be replaced by the joy of the tournament returning to action, whilst the 2021 renewal would gain the anniversary gloss. In that sense, the championship would have two editions boosted by special flavor. Slim pickings, maybe, but, allied to an insurance pay out, it might be a persuasive line of thought. However, Martin Slumbers, chief executive of the R&A, responded to the story shortly before noon, April 2. “ We are continuing to work through our options for The Open this year, including postponement, ” it read. “ Due to a range of external factors, that process is taking some time to resolve. “ We are well aware of the importance of being able to give clear guidance to fans, players and everyone involved and are working to resolve this as soon as we can. “ We will give a further update as soon as we are in a position to do so and thank everyone for their support and understanding in this challenging situation. ” Update April 2: This post has been updated following the response from the R&A.
