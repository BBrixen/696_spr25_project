Whether you're a kid or a squid or an octoling; join us!   Subreddit icon by u/Kellie975 Members Online • UserColonAl Getting started in Splatoon 2 (I'm very confused and need some help) So... My family bought a Switch as an impulse sort of thing, and picked up a few games to go with it. Seeing how everyone raves about Splatoon 2, I just bought it in my frenzy of purchasing and never thought to pull it out until last night after tiring of Zelda and Mario Kart. I thought this could be some sort of split screen sort of deal, but I guess I should have actually researched a little because obviously that's not the case - my bad. That said...  the lack of intuitive menu system is super confusing to me. I was pretty tired last night so ended up giving up and turning it off, but would like to try and get into the game more. It seems like Splatoon 2 is basically just a multiplayer-only sort of deal? I did figure out how to jump into a game last night and got my ass completely kicked after going through the tutorial.  Everyone had different weapons etc which I assume you unlock the more you play, but does that mean I just have to keep getting stomped over and over in multiplayer in order to unlock stuff? Basically, is there a single player element to this game at all?  Some sort of story/campaign?  I have an 8 year old daughter who is really intrigued at how colourful and fun the game looks, but she's not great at games and if the only way she can play is online with seasoned players she'll lose interest immediately. Is there some sort of 'getting started' guide to this at all, or a few tips that you guys can throw our way please? Thanks Read more New to Reddit?
