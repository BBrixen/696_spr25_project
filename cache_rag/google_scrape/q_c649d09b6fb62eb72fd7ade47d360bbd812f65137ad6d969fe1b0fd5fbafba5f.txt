The series begins with an inside look at the early reign of the queen, who ascended the throne at age 25 after the death of her father, King George VI. As the decades pass, personal intrigues, romances, and political rivalries are revealed that played a big role in events that shaped the later years of the 20th century.

The Crown — Season 3 What to Know Critics Consensus Olivia Colman shines, but as The Crown marches on in reliably luxurious fashion through time it finds space for the characters around her, providing ample opportunity for the appealing ensemble to gleam, too. Read Critics Reviews Critics Reviews View All (102) Critics Reviews Rachel Syme The New Republic The Netflix show's third season is a wonder of restraint. Dec 13, 2019 Full Review Dave Calhoun Time Out Research, facts and history colliding with imagination, hearsay and gossip, all flavoured with a dash of just enough respect and served with an enlivening accompanying shot of impertinence. Rated: 4/4 Dec 12, 2019 Full Review Olly Richards Empire Magazine Season 3 shows The Crown can handle the more soapy elements of the royal story with humour, dignity and real emotional intelligence. Rated: 5/5 Dec 12, 2019 Full Review Joonatan Itkonen Toisto.net Here we are, half a century later, and Elizabeth still reigns. Not just in Britain, but on televisions across the globe. The people have spoken. Rated: 4/5 Jul 8, 2024 Full Review Swara Salih But Why Tho? A Geek Community The Crown season 3 is overall a great watch. It lags in places, particularly in episodes that heavily focus on Philip, but otherwise, it’ll give you a great and entertaining insight into the Royals’ internal drama, real or emphasized into fiction. Rated: 8.5/10 Jan 22, 2023 Full Review Tony Black Cultural Conversation Certain Season 3 episodes-Aberfan in particular-are excellent, thought provoking television. It simply lacks the seamless thematic structure of previous seasons. Rated: 3/5 Feb 16, 2021 Full Review Read all reviews Audience Reviews View All (203) audience reviews s c Josh O’Connor is perfection as Prince Charles! He is memorable in everything but this…perfect. And I love Olivia Coleman, but I was so distracted by the fact that the Queen looked  so much older than she  actually was at the time this was taking place that I couldn’t enjoy it. Same with Phillip. Casting and makeup where are you? Rated 4/5 Stars • Rated 4 out of 5 stars 01/31/25 Full Review Diana A It est une série solide. Les performances, surtout de Claire Foy et Olivia Colman, sont impressionnantes, et les décors sont superbes. La série nous plonge vraiment dans l'univers de la famille royale britannique. Parfois, elle est un peu lente, et certains épisodes sont moins captivants que d'autres. Mais si vous aimez l'histoire ou les drames sur des personnages réels, ça vaut le coup d’être regardé. Rated 4/5 Stars • Rated 4 out of 5 stars 12/08/24 Full Review Victor C Loved seasons 1 and 2 but I'm  struggling to get through this season. Such bad casting. Coleman, Dance and Bonham Carter look absolutely nothing like the people they are playing eye colour wrong which I feel is important. The season drags and the subjects are not so intriguing or interesting. They should have just aged the old cast at least until a more significant amount of time had passed. Rated 2/5 Stars • Rated 2 out of 5 stars 06/02/24 Full Review Charlie C My first Tomato review.  At the beginning of the 3rd season, I decided to come here and heavily criticize the 3rd season after the first two seasons. I was thinking to myself how they continued the series with such boring characters, how they don't fit into the continuation at all, and how they don't resemble the younger actors in the slightest, etc. How nothing happens in the season. But after the first few episodes of the 3rd season, I couldn't write a review because I hadn't seen the whole season yet. Now that I've seen the last episode of the season: this season turned out to be brilliant. It evokes mixed emotions: the season simultaneously shows the power and the prison of the royal family. To those who are similarly struck by the change at the beginning, I say: watch it till the end. It's worth it! :) Rated 5/5 Stars • Rated 5 out of 5 stars 05/23/24 Full Review Danny E In reading the reviews for all the seasons of the crown, I'm very surprised how more people don't have season 3 as the best season in the series. I mean, Marketology, Coup & Imbroglio alone are absolute diamonds to view. I mean it could be the introduction of Olivia Coleman as the queen played a huge role in it it, but all the episodes in this season are just fantastical to watch over and over again.
