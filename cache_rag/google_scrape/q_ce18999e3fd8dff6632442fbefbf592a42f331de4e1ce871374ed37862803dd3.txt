"But you never know until you get there how you will handle it," she told BBC. "My advice to both players would be 'just play the ball'. You're playing the opponent, you're not playing the Wimbledon final. Of course, if you get to match point and your heart starts pounding then you feel like you're going to faint, but you somehow manage to keep it together by playing by memory. Everyone gets nervous, it's how little you can choke, how well you can handle the nerves." 18:20 (IST) 10 Jul 2021 Who is Evonne Goolagong, Barty's idol? Evonne Goolagong‚Äôs second Wimbledon title in 1980 was the most recent for an Australian at the AEC. Like Goolagong, Barty has indigenous roots; they‚Äôve known each other for more than a decade and she is wearing a skirt-and-shirt outfit this fortnight inspired by Goolagong‚Äôs dress from 41 years ago. ‚ÄúEvonne has guided the way,‚Äù Barty said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs created a path for all of us as Australians, but as a family, and for our heritage to know that there is an opportunity to chase after your dreams and to do what you love.‚Äù The impossible dream. Inspired by Evonne Goolagong Cawley's legacy, today @AshBarty could follow in her idol's footsteps... #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/vbL9UGof17 ‚Äî Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 10, 2021 18:15 (IST) 10 Jul 2021 WATCH: A trip back in time...
