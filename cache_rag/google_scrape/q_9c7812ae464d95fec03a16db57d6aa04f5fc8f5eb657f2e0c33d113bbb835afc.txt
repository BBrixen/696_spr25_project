Tabatha is the co-chair of the Kansas educator task force, a team of dedicated educators who have helped set the state’s continuous learning guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic, even as she continues to teach her own preschool students. As part of their task of continuing the education of Kansas students during this time, the team joined Kansas Public Broadcasters in producing Learning Across Kansas , a supplemental education television show, hosted by teachers, including Tabatha. These 30-minute shows, individually produced for elementary, middle school and high school students, air Friday and Saturday mornings on KCPT. “I am so honored to have been chosen to represent the incredible educators in our nation as National Teacher of the Year,” she said in a statement. “I hope to bring a voice to the important role early childhood education plays in our society, but also to the powerful role of social-emotional education at all age levels. Now more than ever, we are being reminded that our children must have the ability to regulate their emotions, to connect, and to think critically about the world around them. Together we can help them develop these essential skills.” Tabatha is the first early childhood educator to be named National Teacher of the Year. Her inclusive classroom is housed in Cumbernauld Village, a retirement community and nursing home. The inter-generational program serves special education and typically developing preschoolers, and facilitates daily interactions with residents, who serve as “grandparent” volunteers. Congratulations, Tabatha, from all of us at KCPT! 125 E 31st St, Kansas City, MO 64108 Phone: 816-756-3580 Fax: 816-931-2500 Connect Newsletters YouTube Facebook LinkedIn YouTube TV Links Contact Us Membership Help Careers Media Releases FCC Public File Single Sign-On FAQ About Mission & Vision Board of Directors Executive Staff Community Advisory Board Debate Policy Code of Integrity More PBS 90.9 The Bridge Flatland KC Media Collective Connect with us B4D46BEA-351A-4ED1-A452-3F7DE04739C6 Created with sketchtool. 64D03090-1948-4B4D-A1E2-33CCBBE4FE41 Created with sketchtool. 7EF8F25D-338D-4495-9310-1A1AAB1AC0C2 Created with sketchtool.
