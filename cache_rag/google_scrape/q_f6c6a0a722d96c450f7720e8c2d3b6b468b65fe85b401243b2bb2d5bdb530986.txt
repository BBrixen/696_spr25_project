Williams advanced to the championship round at the All England Club for an 11th time with Thursday's straight-sets victory over Barbora Strycova in the semifinals. The seven-time Wimbledon champion remains one Grand Slam victory shy of Margaret Court's singles record of 24 — a mark she hopes to equal in 2019. Williams' last major victory came at the Australian Open in 2017, the longest drought of her career. To finally catch Court, Williams must defeat Simona Halep in the final. The Romanian challenger, seeded seventh, knocked off No. 8 Elina Svitolina in straight sets to reach the final for the first time at Wimbledon. Halep, 27, won the 2018 French Open and is 1-3 in Grand Slam finals for her career. LIVE: Follow scores from every match at Wimbledon 2019 Williams is 9-2 lifetime against Halep and has won their last five head-to-head matchups, most recently at this year's Australian Open. If Williams falls at Wimbledon, the U.S. Open in August will be her final chance of 2019 to match Court's record. She went 0-2 in the finals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2018, has yet to win a tournament on the 2019 schedule, and this might be one of the last, best chances the all-time great has to make history. Here is everything you need to keep track of Williams' run at Wimbledon in 2019, including a guide to watch her matches live on TV or stream online along with live scoring updates and results from All England Club.
