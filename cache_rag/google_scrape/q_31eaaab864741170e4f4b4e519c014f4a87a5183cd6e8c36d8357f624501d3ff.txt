The automaker, coming off of its best quarter in terms of deliveries and production figures, was able to mark down significant gains in automotive gross margin while decreasing costs of production. This ultimately led to the average cost of its vehicles being sliced by a large percentage, especially when compared to 2017 figures when the Model 3 was just being launched. Tesla (TSLA) Q1 2021 earnings results: $10.39B in revenue, beats with $0.93 EPS The average price of Tesla‚Äôs cars has been slashed from roughly $84,000 to under $38,000 due to the ‚Äù launch of new products and new factories and the reduced mix of Model S and Model X,‚Äù the company said in its Q1 2021 Update Letter and Shareholder Deck. However, more contributions to the company‚Äôs ever-improving financial spreadsheet were made as gross margins improved with decreased production costs. Tesla said in its Shareholder deck : ‚ÄúWhile the ASP of our vehicles declined in Q1, our auto gross margin increased sequentially, as our costs decreased even faster. Reducing the average cost of the vehicles we produce is essential to our mission. In 2017, as we began production of Model 3, our average cost per vehicle across the fleet was ~$84,000. Due to the launch of new products and new factories and the reduced mix of Model S and Model X, our average cost declined to sub-$38,000 per vehicle in Q1.‚Äù Advertisement Tesla has always had impressive gross margins for its cars. One of the most recent reports of an impressive gross margin, which fuels profitability, was in January when¬†Guosen Securities analyzed the Model Y. The study broke down the total gross margin and revealed it was 29.4%, around three times the industry average that lies at between 8-10% for luxury cars. We previously reported on it , saying: ‚ÄúAccording to the Shenzhen, China-based financial firm, Tesla‚Äôs China Model Y only costs ¬•237,930 (USD 36,852) to produce. However, its selling point gives Tesla a 29.4% gross margin with a price of ¬•339,900 (USD 52,646.25).‚Äù Of course, cutting costs and improving margins will help the financials of any company. When you‚Äôre dealing with cars, you need demand, and Tesla has plenty of that with its Model 3 and Model Y. In fact, the Model 3 was the best-selling premium sedan in the world just three-and-a-half years into production, outselling highly-popular and long-time leaders of the luxury vehicle segment, like the BMW 3 Series and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. Tesla remains profitable for the seventh straight quarter, extending the already impressive company record. Additionally, Tesla beat consensus estimates with a revenue of $10.389 billion for the first quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.93, and non-GAAP net income surpassed $1B for the first time in the company‚Äôs history.

The update was initially reported by Insider , which cited three people reportedly familiar with the matter. Bigger Semi Team As per the publication‚Äôs sources, Tesla has reportedly hired over a thousand new factory workers for the Semi program in Nevada.

To help the new members of the Semi team, Tesla has reportedly brought in the new workers to Giga Nevada for training and tours over the past months. These efforts are quite a notable update for the Semi program, the publication‚Äôs sources claimed, since less than 100 factory workers were reportedly assigned to the Class 8 all-electric truck until recently. Tesla has not issued a comment about the matter as of writing. Advertisement Tesla Semi Jobs and Updates Insider ‚Äôs report came amidst a hiring ramp in Tesla‚Äôs Careers website .

As per Tesla Semi program lead Dan Priestley, the company has spent the last few months building the facility‚Äôs shell, so efforts are now underway to equip the factory with production equipment. The Tesla executive also reiterated the company‚Äôs target of producing 50,000 units of the Semi annually from its Nevada factory.

Published 6 hours ago on April 29, 2025 By Simon Alvarez Credit: Elon Musk/X Following the first quarter Tesla earnings call, CEO Elon Musk seems to have become a bit more relaxed‚Äîrelaxed enough to joke about fighting a gorilla with 99 other people, at least. It‚Äôs a good sign, if any, that the overworked Musk is becoming a bit more lighthearted again and not too busy picking fights with politicians on social media. The Viral 100 Men vs 1 Gorilla Challenge Over the weekend, a post on social media platform X went viral. The post itself was quite simple, with user @DreamChasnMike stating that he thinks 100 men could beat one gorilla. ‚ÄúEverybody just gotta be dedicated to the sh*t,‚Äù the X user joked. The post exploded on the platform , garnering 284 million impressions as of writing. i think 100 niggas could beat 1 gorilla everybody just gotta be dedicated to the shitüòÇüòÇ‚Äî üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è (@DreamChasnMike) April 25, 2025 The silly question also triggered a massive debate about whether 100 men would really stand a chance against a literal gorilla. Some users even lamented that the premise was a sign of male hubris. Nevertheless, the question proved to be a fun topic on X, with some more dedicated users even posting simulated videos of what the ‚Äú100 Men vs 1 Gorilla Challenge‚Äù could look like. 100 men vs 1 Gorilla Who you got? $MVG I got 1 Gorilla. pic.twitter.com/b7vKKLgduH ‚Äî Crypto_Moony (@knicksreek) April 27, 2025 Mr. Beast and Elon Musk Join In The premise is quite similar to other viral videos from noted YouTube creator Mr. Beast , so it was no surprise that edited images of Mr. Beast YouTube thumbnails with ‚Äú100 Men vs a Gorilla‚Äù also started spreading on the social media platform. Mr. Beast, who tends to be game to such silly ideas, actually reposted the edited image, joking ‚ÄúNeed 100 men to test this, any volunteers?‚Äù Advertisement Need 100 men to test this, any volunteers? pic.twitter.com/p2iQvOWbYJ ‚Äî MrBeast (@MrBeast) April 28, 2025 In true Elon Musk fashion , the Tesla and SpaceX CEO noted that he would join the challenge. ‚ÄúSure, what‚Äôs the worst that could happen‚Äù Musk wrote in his post on X.

Over the past months, after all, Musk has been very political and quite confrontational on social media. With Musk soon taking a step back from the Department of Government Efficiency‚Äôs (DOGE) daily operations, however, it seems like X will soon get a more tempered and lighthearted Elon Musk once more. Continue Reading News Big Tesla win? Sec Lutnick says cars with 85% domestic content will face zero tariffs That‚Äôs a big competitive advantage for Tesla‚Äôs best-selling vehicle. Published 7 hours ago on April 29, 2025 By Simon Alvarez Credit: Tesla Europe & Middle East/X It appears that Tesla may see itself with a notable advantage in the United States. This is, at least, as per recent comments from United States Commerce Secretary¬†Howard Lutnick. Lutnick‚Äôs Comments In recent comments to reporters, Lutnick stated that vehicles finished in the United States with 85% domestic content will have no tariff applied, as noted in a report from The Guardian . Automakers that meet this threshold stand to gain an advantage in the U.S. auto sector, especially considering the Trump administration‚Äôs aggressive tariffs. As per Lutnick, the administration‚Äôs auto tariffs will apply to foreign carmakers that are building their vehicles in the United States. ‚ÄúThis is ‚Äòfinish your cars in America and you win‚Äô,‚Äù¬†Lutnick stated. JUST IN: Commerce Secretary Lutnick says auto tariff relief is coming ‚Ä¢ Cars manufactured with at least 85% of domestic content will face ZERO tariffs ‚Ä¢ US automakers will receive credit up to 15% of the value of vehicles to offset cost of imported parts‚Äî Morning Brew ‚òïÔ∏è (@MorningBrew) April 29, 2025 Big Tesla Advantage Lutnick‚Äôs comments were received positively by Tesla watchers on social media, many of whom noted that the threshold would probably be met only by the electric vehicle maker‚Äôs cars. Teslas that are sold in the United States are built in the United States , and they have consistently ranked among the most American cars in the country for several years running. Advertisement Back in December, for example, American University‚Äôs Kogod School of Business released its Made in America Auto Index , which explores the total domestic content of vehicles that are available for purchase today. In its rankings, only three vehicles received a total domestic content score of 85% or higher‚Äîthe Tesla Model Y, Model Y Long Range, and the Model 3 Performance. The two Model Y variants received a total domestic content score of 85%, while the Model 3 Performance had a total domestic content of 87.5%. If Secretary Lutnick‚Äôs comments are any indication, these three vehicles would be subjected to zero tariffs. This bodes well for Tesla, as the Model Y is the company‚Äôs best-selling vehicle by a notable margin.
