Yesterday I saw Avatar 2 at IMAX 3D, I was wondering other people's thoughts on it here. I found it a sumptuous watery bioluminescent visual feast as expected that spent a large chunk of its 3 hour 12 runtime happily not giving a damn about the plot. These plotless, chill/worldbuilding parts were arguably the best parts (although less so to everyone's bladders). To the point my date I saw it with complained whenever it got back to the actual (very straightforward, arguably generic) plot with the antagonists... It was overall a great IMAX 3D experience like the first one, but I don't think I'm alone in finding the periodic doubling of the frame rate really distracting, immersion-breaking, and visually unpleasant. It looked like I'm watching a videogame at 1.75 speed. And to switch back and forth so you can never get used to it?! I think I'm just sensitive to high frame rates in film as I know most other people don't even notice. It was painful in the first Hobbit film too, although at least that didn't switch back and forth. Otherwise it was a pretty cool, highly vivid film. But then I'm an absolute sucker for bioluminescence. I think anyone who's a fan of the first Avatar will be a fan of the second (which is probably its equal), but those who bounced off the first or consider it hugely overrated will likely not enjoy the second.
