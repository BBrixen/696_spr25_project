Aside from Nissan with the Leaf, who recently loss their galvanizing CEO and who's market cap has tanked since, what major automaker has anywhere near the success of Tesla with EV? No doubt execution has been an issue in the past, but recent sales trends, completion of gigafactory, and Chinese expansion show that they are on the right trend. Tesla's were confined to the luxury market, but the Model 3 is doing well and Tesla is being allowed to come out with more and more SKUs while the other big auto's are still finding their footing. The branding is on point without the need to advertise, like the iPhone, Tesla's are becoming just a feature of everyday life (at least in large metro's). Finally, and this is absolutely non-empirical, I just believe in Elon. Tesla might be one of those companies that simply fades away once a galvanizing leader leaves, but as long as his heart is beating I'll hold. Sohcahtoa82 on Jan 30, 2020 | parent | next [–] Other car manufacturers are missing what makes Tesla do so well. It's a lot of things, really.  Range, performance, the hope of self-driving, the supercharging network (Which is much bigger than people think!), and of course, the fact that they look like normal cars.  Most other EVs like the Leaf are either incredibly lacking in range and performance, or they're incredibly ugly like the BMW i3. Then you've got cars like the Mullen Qiantu K50 [0] that try to be something special, but other than looks are incredibly lackluster and overpriced.  $125K, and its performance and range are on par with a $48K Model 3 LR AWD.  They're trying to brand it like a supercar, but it's only a supercar in the looks. It's crazy to me that other makers can't even get charging done well.  Most public CHAdeMO or CCS chargers are only up to 50 kW, while Tesla superchargers are usually 72 kW and sometimes up to 150 kW.  Being able to charge quickly is a must when one of your biggest barriers to getting customers is overcoming their range anxiety.

This is while Telsa is building out a charging network and fighting for a direct to consumer sales model and also possessing a knowledge base of every fault that's ever occurred in it's entire fleet and every Tesla Sale increases the return on Tesla's deployed capital plus a highly dedicated creative resilient workforce that are at the point of smoothing variability and product refinement. So for BMW to win they have to bet the factory that they will take enough market share while Tesla's quality and brand strengthen. Hence the current share valuation. Now a lot of people say Elon is a  manipulative exaggerator but the fact remains he has built car sensor database company with a carbon advantage that has BMW on the ropes while reigniting a space race.  If machine learning can sort the data and it seems to be improving year on year then alot of people who haven't built nearly as much will probably be taking a Tesla to work. Why do people want Tesla to fail. Economies of scale, improving battery technology and a global charging network and everyone eventually has a cheaper travel option. How revered the founder was is a quite irrelevant. philwelch on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Range, performance, the hope of self-driving, the supercharging network (Which is much bigger than people think!), and of course, the fact that they look like normal cars. The self-driving bit is a risk either way, but I think Tesla is dangerously close to losing out on both the “looking like a normal car” and potentially the performance factor if they’re serious about Cybertruck. jonplackett on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Personally I think cybertruck is a one-off looks wise. The model Y looks totally normal. Plus I actually think the cybertruck looks awesome (you have to see it as a driving space ship not a car) and the value is amazing - so much range for not that much money. And that thing looks built to last (balls of metal thrown at the windows withstanding) simonebrunozzi on Feb 4, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The glass issue will be solved eventually. And I don't mind a bulletproof car that looks amazing (to me). nexuist on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] >the fact that they look like normal cars This was my first thought during the Cybertruck unveil. It no longer looks like a normal truck. Rivian was far out originally, but this blew it out the park. So the question is really, would people want an electric pickup truck that looks like nothing before it? I'm leaning towards yes, but we have to wait for the market to make its choice to find out for sure. taneq on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] It looks as much like a conventional truck as the Hummer did, and that was arguably a great success. I think the primary market, at least at first, is going to be guys who want a big flashy truck to be noticed in. I mean, look how much attention Elon gets in it everywhere he goes. philwelch on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Cybertruck is going to be an Edsel-type blunder if they keep pursuing it. It’s obvious that Elon is a car guy because the Tesla cars all look slick and sporty but he’s obviously not a truck guy and I think he’s utterly misunderstood the market with Cybertruck. nickik on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Based on what? Its cheap, can pull lots of stuff fast, you can plug in power tools and it has lots of storage area. philwelch on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] It looks stupid, the trapezoidal side walls around the truck bed actually make it much less usable, and it looks stupid. The whole problem with eg the BMW i-Series or most other electric cars is that they are designed in a silly way that says, “look at me, I’m a weird electric car, I’m not a normal car at all, I’m willing to look like a total dork in order to virtue-signal about being eco-friendly”. Teslas just look like sports cars—except the Cybertruck’s styling is 100% “dorky virtue signal about having a weird special truck”, and truck people are even less likely than car people to put up with that. nickik on Jan 31, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Because you have active suspension you the bed can actually be lower then most trucks. Also overall usability seems like its clearly better on this truck compared to the competition you basically point out one single thing and ignore everything that goes the other direction. And I think it looks cool, so that literally purely your opinion. The design of the truck allows it to be produced for 40k and still have quite a bit of range. Those performance and price measures matter. Had they copied an F150 it would cost at least 50k and would not have as much range. Tesla had to make conservative cars to establish themselves, but a revolutionary brands will not always just copy the competition, specially when trucks are on of the most uninspired markets where literally every vehicle is a copy of the other. philwelch on Jan 31, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Do you own a truck? What do you use it for and how would the Cybertruck provide an improvement? I wouldn't characterize Tesla's other cars as "conservative" in the slightest. "Conservative" makes me think of Volvo or Lexus. The Model S is absolutely gorgeous and if any car aficionado saw it, he would say, "that is an absolutely gorgeous car". It literally looks like a better Lamborghini, Ferrari, or Porsche. The Cybertruck provokes reactions somewhere on a spectrum between "what the fuck is that?" and "hmm, that's interesting". Which is roughly the same design space that the Pontiac Aztek, Chrysler PT Cruiser, and BMW i-Series inhabit. It's not fertile ground. philwelch on Jan 31, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] For usability, I looked to see what truck users on /r/Trucks had to say about it.[1][2]  Here are some highlights, both positive and negative: > It’s really damn cool aside from the roof coming to a point. I’m not sure I understand that design decision. However, onboard air compressor, 110v/220v accessory power, fast as shit, good ground clearance, integral bed cover and ramps, air ride suspension, and tough shell to boot... there is a lot to like here. I might just have to buy one in a couple years. >  Yeah because everyone wants a ‘bed’ you can’t load from the sides. > I think [being able to load the truck bed from the sides] really only matters for people who use their trucks for actual work. This is obviously for people who want a truck for play and not work. > ... he could have taken this seriously and actually made an impact. Now he’s proven the older anti EV crowd 100% correct that an electric truck isn’t a viable alternative. > Clearly designed by someone who has literally never even used a truck once in their entire life. > It's stupid tall bedsides ruin it for slide in campers too. If it wasn't for that the 3500lb payload and huge battery would make it great for a slide in. > I'm surprised you all are not pouncing on the unibody. The other "truck" (Honda) that uses a unibody construction does not get much love. > [People who like the Cybertruck design are] those who've never actually used a truck to haul items and/or trailers. Those who are in the ranching, mining, and other similar industries are laughing at this. > Is the bed cover transparent? Seems like the rear window is only usable when the cover is retracted. I'm sorry. This is a truck for the Ridgeline crowd. No 8ft bed option. Only crew cab configuration. AWD, not 4WD. Can't tow a Gooseneck or 5th wheel, which you're gonna want when towing a 14K trailer. People will buy it. I won't. > It’s a weird case of form over function. He was so focused on the blade runner vibe he forgot to make sure it was usable as a truck. Can’t even get to the front of the bed without opening the tailgate and getting inside. > Trucks have a utilitarian purpose. There is a reason for their shapes. And if you look worldwide there are some differences, but also some commonalities. Like being able to access the frigging bed. That’s a massive failure here. > There’s some things about truck design that are important to the function of being a truck. Like not having angled bed sides so you can fucking reach the first 1/2 of the bed without getting in it or being able to tow a 5th wheel. > After looking at more pictures today I realized it doesn't even have a true 6.5' bed. It's much shorter than that, but angles in underneath the rear seats. Probably ok for hauling a few sheets of plywood, but putting in, say, furniture, would be harder. > I set things in the bed over the bedside a lot. And climb in the sides. I’d have to awkwardly yeet shit over the side of that angled monstrosity > This truck looks like an absolute nightmare to load and unload tbh. I actually even ditched my bed for a Bradford flatbed to make my truck easier to use. Rear/side visibility looks awful. Boasts a 14,000 towing capacity yet it looks like a nightmare to hook up to a trailer. I’d love to know how far this thing can tow 14,000lbs. Payload of “3,900lbs”. What does the truck itself weigh? Does Tesla understand GVWR or how to calculate payload or is it assuming it’s potential buyers do not? I guess I just don’t understand the whole concept and what exactly they’re going for. Seems like they’re trying to do too much. This has been the plague of these types of “crossovers” which is exactly what this is. El Camino, Ford Ranchero, Subaru Brat, Subaru Baja, Chevy Avalanche, Honda Ridgeline, the list goes on and on. > Having a large locking cover would give me so much peace of mind when I'm parked with my tools in there. Having the thing build of stainless steel made me ask why hasn't trucks been main of stainless steel for years. > The bed has some L-Tracks and T-Slots in it too for easy tie downs, which was something I learned from a video I saw that someone did a test drive in > Literally the only good truck feature is the integrated full width ramp in the tailgate. > And you can lower the suspension in the back to make it easier! I would have killed for that the last few times i was loading heavy equipment into the back of my truck by myself. I had to make due with backing up to a hill and using a shitty steel ramp that would fall if i so much as looked at it wrong. > Let's be honest, most people in suburbia/cities with trucks are just drugstore cowboys anyway. This truck will meet the needs of most consumers > Good luck towing a 5th wheel with that thing > If you need a truck, Cybertruck's already disqualified itself. Little clearance, no room for mods, unibody, no side access to the truck bed, likely range issues (once you add a load), and that's just the stuff we know about now. I can only imagine buying this if you buy a truck just so you can feel like you're driving a truck but never plan on using the truck features beyond occasional off-roading.

Seriously, the world has enough identical-looking sedans and identical-looking trucks. I can’t tell most major brands apart anymore until I see them up close. philwelch on Jan 31, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Let me guess, you used to drive a PT Cruiser :) sunstone on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I don't love the look of the Cybertruck but what I do love is the value per dollar and the larger than expected cab space. speedgoose on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Many EVs have a good enough range and more than good enough performances. Sure a ipace or etron don't drive as far as a equivalent Tesla, but sometimes you don't need that. Also, we are many to love the i3 look. It's a matter of tastes. Sohcahtoa82 on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > Many EVs have a good enough range and more than good enough performances. Range is good enough for daily driving, sure. More than good enough performance?  Subjective and debatable.  I frequently hear about all the instant torque of an EV, but all it takes is a ride in a Leaf to learn that this really only applies to Teslas and the more sport-intended EVs.  In other words, not the Leaf.  Sure, the torque is still instant, but its...not a lot. But the range...we need more 300+ mile EVs that support 150+ kW charging in order to overcome people's range anxiety for road trips, not to mention more 150+ kW chargers.  I'm taking my Model 3 Performance on a 2,250 mile road trip later this year, and it'll be my first EV road trip.  I'd be lying if I didn't say that I'm feeling a little anxious about it.  I've planned the crap out of my stops (Thanks to sites like ABRP), but still a little nervous.  If I had a SR Model 3, I'd probably just say forget it and take my wife's CRV. jonplackett on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I realised awhile back how my brain works when I buy stuff. Most of my happiness with something I buy is based on regret or not. I know that if I buy an electric car that isn’t a Tesla, whenever that car bugs me, I will think ‘damn it, I wish I bought a Tesla’ But if I buy a Tesla, I’m not going to think it wish ‘I’d bought a leaf’ That’s just me. I don’t even have an electric car yet. But my name is down for the cybertruck. speedgoose on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I understand you well. However, it's a lot simpler when you can't afford or justify buying the fancy car. I bought an used electric car with a tiny range to commute and every time I did long trips with it I wished I got a Tesla with a five times bigger battery. But then I think about it, I do not regret not spending the money on a Model S, renting a long range car a few times a year, and buying a bigger flat with the money I saved. jonplackett on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] But a model 3... maybe? CraftThatBlock on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] The logo for Mullen is incredibly similar to Tesla's. Also, Supercharger v3 goes up to 250kW simonebrunozzi on Feb 4, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] 250? That's insane! Do you know what the timeline is? Can we assume all charging stations will be upgraded, or will there be a limitation in capacity? sunstone on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] For example, what Mercedes is missing for the EQC electric SUV production is, enough batteries for full production. I wonder how many other makers are looking at this particular bottle neck? IshKebab on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I went to a supermarket in the UK recently that had an electric car charging area, with space for around 8 cars. Guess what the maximum charging power was? 7 kW. Seven! What is the point of that? 205guy on Jan 31, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] You’ve got to realize electric cars are evolving fast, the affordable 200+ mile-range that charges in 30 minutes is Tesla’s 1-year old model 3. 7kW is what everyone who bought a Nissan Leaf 4-5 years ago expected and used. Also, the charger is probably 4-5 years old. It’s a totally different mind-set and usage pattern. Gas-like refills vs just topping off for free. Older EVs with smaller batteries that you charge all around town, vs newer Tesla’s that you supercharge like a fill-up. But 7kW can still give you 30 miles of range in an hour of shopping, plenty to get home somewhere in the suburbs even if you happen to be low already. Sohcahtoa82 on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] 7 kW would take ~11 hours to recharge a Model 3 LR/Perf battery. The only place a 7 kW charger should be considered acceptable is at home, a hotel, or the workplace.  A supermarket where you're likely to only be parked up to an hour?  Nah, that needs to be much more. ninth_ant on Jan 30, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] What you describe would be the “bull case” dozens of billions in valuation ago.  Right now we are quite disconnected from that, in my analysis. To justify their current valuation, the “bull case” is for them to dominate the entire automative industry (not just the EV segment) and do an Amazon-like turnaround of losses into profitability. Anything short of that, their valuation is ludicrous. mrep on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > To justify their current valuation, the “bull case” is for them to dominate the entire automative industry (not just the EV segment) Toyota has over twice the market cap that Tesla has (230 billion vs 105 billion) and considering how big the auto industry is outside of just these 2 companies, I don't know how you think an automotive company at 105 billion is vastly overvalued. hyperbovine on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The argument is not that no car maker deserves to be valued at $XXX billion. It's that Tesla, which produced around ~1/30th the number of autos as Toyota last year, probably shouldn't have a market cap that's anywhere near Toyota's. _dp9d on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I think your mistake is in assuming that Tesla only makes cars, and the number of them they make is the only factor that goes into their valuation. They also have the world's biggest charging network, storage solutions, solar solutions and produce more batteries than virtually everyone else combined. Mercedes actually just put out a press release that said they can't build enough electric cars because they can't build enough batteries, because Tesla acquired the company they were going to use in 2016 . Evidently Mercedes have done exactly zero about that in the years since. Of course Tesla also have the whole "self driving car" thing they've been working on for a while.  If they crack that one in the next ~24 months, their valuation will easily top Toyota's, because they're worth so much more than just how many cars they can build. xkjkls on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] How much of their revenue comes from not making cars? _dp9d on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Good point. Right now it's not much, but I think the valuation is based on the speculation that it could soon be a lot. Right now revenue from energy storage resembles Tesla's auto business in 2013[1].. so if it grows at the same rate... [1] https://twitter.com/kerooke/status/1222637828741439488 xkjkls on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Their solar business, which they purchased, has declined every year since the acquisition jlbooker on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Until now. "The company marked a 26% quarter-on-quarter increase in solar installations" https://cleantechnica.com/2020/01/29/tesla-energy-lifts-off-... xkjkls on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] QoQ. They still showed a YoY decline for 2019. And that's in a market that's been expanding, so they've significantly lost market share. nickik on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] What is important is that they can make money from selling lots of electric cars. While the other companies get horrifying margin on their electric car and they have no clue how to make money with them. xkjkls on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Can they? They had a loss of $800 million in 2019, and that’s with over $500 million in regulatory credit sales boosting that. The EV market still seems like it incinerates capital nickik on Jan 31, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] They lost that money because they had to repay massive amount of debt early in the year. They did that successfully and once that debt was payed they were profitable. What matters is that they produce lots of cars and the cars have a better then expected profit margin, focusing on anything else is simply foolish. xkjkls on Feb 2, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] No, that’s GAAP loss, so that doesn’t include any debt repayments. That’s what the business generated. And they produced the most cars they ever did and still lost money for the tenth consecutive year, in a year where the expectations given from Wall Street and the company were to make money. reitzensteinm on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Can you please link me to this press release? _dp9d on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Press release for what? reitzensteinm on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] This: "Mercedes actually just put out a press release that said they can't build enough electric cars because they can't build enough batteries, because Tesla acquired the company they were going to use in 2016.

This growth will eventually plateau but it's a good bet that it will do so with millions of cars in production. imtringued on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] One of them has manufactured 900k cars the other manufactured more than 200 million. Even if Tesla were the market leader and reached peak production rates of 10 million cars per year it would still take 20 years to catch up and justify that valuation. megablast on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] What does the total car manufactures have to do with anything at all? Cars sold last year, sure, that makes sense. rodgerd on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] They would have to do substantially better than Amazon, who lost far less money before becoming profitable. megablast on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Hardware startups are always harder. Diederich on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Even as a long-time Tesla fan, I think their stock price is fairly excessive. > the “bull case” is for them to dominate the entire automative industry (not just the EV segment) Is Tesla's market valuation highest than the highest valued automakers? 300bps on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Tesla is not just a car manufacturer though right?  They are a solar company and battery company too.  They could conceivably have astronomical growth in both of those segments. andrewmunsell on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The valuation of Tesla also seems very high to me at first, but given their growth in the other segments such as energy storage and generation, I absolutely think that the valuation could be justified. Tesla owns the entire vertical from battery cell manufacturing, using those cells to do work (automotive), home and grid energy storage, and solar generation. Throw in the rest of Elon’s companies and you also get the transportation network itself (Boring) and even the data provider for these cars that need to be highly connected (Starlink). And if you really want to believe Elon, some weird, someday a pressurized version of the Cybertruck might become the transportation off of this  planet. aeternum on Jan 31, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] And that's not all.  They are also now a chip maker, an insurance company, a technology company with some of the leading research and IP in self-driving, and also leaders in automated manufacturing. beamatronic on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Other car manufacturers would be smart to source their batteries from Tesla. _dp9d on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I doubt Tesla will sell to them, Elon has said a few times their vehicle output is constrained by how many battery cells they can make. If they sell those cells to other manufacturers, they won't be able to make so many cars themselves. blaser-waffle on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Making vehicles is hard.  There are a lot of logistical and technological challenges, plus the deep penetration of cars into society means that marketing, perception, and utility are on the lips of the hyper-rich down to the common man. With batteries... you just make batteries.  With cars you have to score adequate or better in lots of different areas to be competitive. jonplackett on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] It’s funny how closely Tesla mirrors iPhone and the doubts everyone had about that VS The traditional phone makers. “No-one wants a touch screen keyboard” etc, the CEOs said as their business evaporated. Tesla are still at iPhone 3G point I reckon, having just released their first affordable car. Also consider that while they are so far ahead - they are still accelerating. And the traditional car makers haven’t even realised they’re in a race to the death yet. Most countries have barred the sale on non-EV cars in couple of decades. That’s not actually that far away. Or self driving could make all other cars seem like Nokia 3310s. wuschel on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Out of curiosity: Could you explain your reasoning with numbers? Cheers! throwaway5752 on Jan 30, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] GM? Bolt is a great car and GM has enormous production capability. Well aware of the difference in sales figures, but having driven both, I prefer it to the Model S. I think battery tech will end up deciding the market, though, and GM would have to pivot harder that I think they are able to in order to beat Tesla. I am very curious about their internal R&D pipeline for the Maxwell technology. primrose on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Why do you prefer the Bolt? From my perspective the Bolt is: -Ugly -Less safe -Slower -Doesn't drive itself, or will be capable in the future Worst of all the Bolt's infotainment system is horrible. https://www.chevrolet.com/content/dam/chevrolet/na/us/englis... throwaway5752 on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I preferred the Bolt because it had similar and adequate range, adequate recharge capability, better drive, felt substantially roomier in the interior, and I preferred the higher seating. I have no use for an infotainment system in any vehicle (give me a hotspot and I'll bring my own devices). I disliked the Tesla center mounted tablet console dashboard, though that's subjective. I don't think the Tesla drives itself, does it? That was not a factor for me, and if anything would be a mild negative at the current level of self-driving tech maturity. At any rate, the Bolt had some useful driver assist packages for safety, though they are upgrades. I think they both have fairly similar safety ratings. And speed isn't a consideration for me, as long as it goes fast enough for highway. Nor is appearance, within reason. I really am thrilled for Tesla's success and don't think there is a "right car" but a "right car for you". The Bolt is a good car, though. primrose on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > would be a mild negative at the current level of self-driving tech maturity Tesla's more or less take over on the freeway. They are also on their way to mastering traffic lights. > center mounted tablet console dashboard Yeah, that's a little weird. > the Bolt had some useful driver assist packages for safety, though they are upgrades Tesla's are the safest cars on the road now. CPLX on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > They are also on their way to mastering traffic lights. Sure and I’m on my way to mastering Russian Roulette.

[0] https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/tesla-earns-its-first-ever-... diek on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I recently bought a 2020 Bolt LT and I really enjoy it - $26k "out the door" price (after taxes, registration, etc) - 260 miles of range (66kWh battery by LG Chem) - DC Fast Charging - upright seating - lots of headroom/legroom in the front and backseat - dedicated LCD for the driver, separate from infotainment system I compared it to a Tesla (test drove a Model 3), and a Tesla would be about $15k more. I have no use for self-driving.  As a software engineer, I feel that full self-driving requires a general AI, which I think is on the order of decades away. I really just wanted a simple electric car with minimal maintenance and no fossil fuel dependencies. Minimal complexity, no gimmicks (fart generator, Tesla?  come on...) With those requirements, the Bolt is awesome. megablast on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > I have no use for self-driving.

AtlasBarfed on Jan 31, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The management of car manufacturers are full of dinosaurs and execs that hate evs due to compliance regs. The dealer networks are outright hostile to them since maintenance revenue is reduced so much. tonyedgecombe on Jan 30, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] I still think the other manufacturers aren't going to stay behind forever. VW in particular seem to be betting the company on their MEB platform. xkjkls on Jan 29, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] Tesla still lost $800 million this year and has never had a profitable year, on both record car sales and record regulatory credit sales. What about that indicates sustainability? jussij on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The financial results from the link don't show a $800 million loss for this year. From that document in the FINANCIAL SUMMARY section there are these quarterly profit/loss number: Income (loss) from operations      Q1-2019  Q2-2019  Q3-2019   Q4-2019          -522     -167      261       359 So for the first half of the year Tesla did lose 689 million dollars. But for the whole year that was only a loss of 69 million dollars. I think what the market likes is the Tesla cash position. If you look at those it would appear Tesla is no longer burning cash. Cash and cash equivalents      Q4-2018   Q1-2019  Q2-2019  Q3-2019   Q4-2019  QoQ   YoY     3,686     2,198    4,955    5,338     6,268    17%   70% The fact that the year on year cash position grew by 70% would be pretty comforting to shareholders. xkjkls on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] You’re using non-GAAP numbers.

How does this stack up to last year, and forecasts for next year?  If they were in the hole $120MM last year and now only 69, with forecasts for ~20MM or less next year then there is a clear road to profitability and I might be willing to do the Long thing. trhway on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] $800M loss on $25B sales (which are growing YoY while R&D actually resulting in new models and features is maintained stable) is a noise at this point. neosat on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Agree. Given the growth numbers and their market leadership in the EV area, there's a strong case to be made that this 'loss' is more of an 'investment' to set up for future revenue growth and consequently profits that come with increasing maturity and operational cost reductions. xkjkls on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] They have shrunk in sales YoY in the US and Norway, their two largest markets. They managed to grow globally by finding the most advantageous subsidies for them to take advantage of. However, even that only gave them 1% growth of the past year. woodandsteel on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The low growth was because of production problems and because they maxed out their single factory. Now they have another factory producing and a third under construction. As to subsidies, governments are pushing ev's harder and harder. The EU has continually-increasing fleet standards that can be met only by adding more ev's, and China has continually increasing ev production standards. Ev sales are going to keep increasing, and Tesla makes the best ev's. Sales, revenues and profits are going to keep going up. xkjkls on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Why were they able to meet a run rate or 500k cars a year in Q4 of last year and not sustain it if their factory was maxed out? And why would they claim in projections that their factory was capable of producing that if they didn’t meet that? Companies are rarely production constrained. Many claim they are, but the fact that Tesla sales in their two largest markets declined doesn’t indicate to me that production is their number one issue. woodandsteel on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] At 500k per year they were still nowhere near meeting global demand, and they decided to move sales away from markets they were already well-established in, and into new ones. The nice thing about this disagreement we are having is it will be settled by what happens in the next year. I say Tesla's sales will go up strongly now that it has another factory. I take it you think they won't, and all that new capacity will go unsold. xeromal on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] You're spot on with everything. I think the biggest hitch this year will be China. That is such a huge market xkjkls on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Again they produced 367k, not 500k, like they claimed they could. If they could produce 500k, why claim they could, and why didn’t they? And I would say Tesla’s revenue growth will start to flatline, yes, as the last two quarters have shown. woodandsteel on Jan 31, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Their production capacity increased in every quarter. By the end of the year it was at a 500k per year rate. And it is continuing to go up rapidly, now that it has a new factory. xkjkls on Feb 2, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Did it? They only produced a small number more than they did per quarter at the end of last year. Why do we think they are production constrained? xkjkls on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] R&D isn’t even meeting depreciation though. Either these factories are some how never before seen in accounting history or this company is underinvesting in its futures zaroth on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Actually there’s a third option which has been discussed on their financial calls. Their capital efficiency has markedly increased. To put it less glamorously, they burned boatloads of money chasing “alien dreadnaught” style fully automated production, and after recognizing that failure (better late than never) they now find they are able to build out new production lines at a fraction of the first line’s cost. DarmokJalad1701 on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] If you look at their letter you can see a comparison between the layouts of their California and Shanghai factories. Massive difference in efficiency. They learned a lot from their initial debacle of Model 3 ramp-up. Cap-ex per unit was announced as being 65% lower in the China factory. QuantumGood on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] 65% lower cap-ex per unit in China is astonishing. Elon's "machine that builds the machine" vision really created a lot of misprioritization. xkjkls on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Maybe. My bet is that they have been underinvesting in order to meet financial results, and that that will catch up to them. Looking at other financial statement history, this seems like a safe bet. woodandsteel on Jan 31, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] It is really hard to say they are underinvesting when they just opened a new factory and have a new vehicle, the Y, that just started production. xkjkls on Feb 2, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] It’s really hard to ever say a company is properly investing if their CapEx on their income statements exceeds their depreciation. Can you name other fast growing companies that is true for? woodandsteel on Feb 2, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I don't understand enough about financials to understand what you are saying. But more to the point, what exactly do you think Tesla should have been spending its money on that it didn't? And let add to my original comment that Tesla also has the Semi going into production later this year, and recently brought out a greatly improved version of its solar roof, and is working like crazy on self-driving. But back to my question: what should it have been spending its money on that it didn't? xkjkls on Feb 3, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > I don't understand enough about financials to understand what you are saying. Capital Expenditures are what a company spends on land, buildings, equipment -- all of those sort of long term assets. Depreciation is how much the value of those assets decline over time with usage and would eventually require maintenance or repair costs. Usually, when depreciation exceeds CapEx, it means the company isn't spending enough to maintain their current assets, and this will eventually catch up to them. For growing companies investing in the future, CapEx is usually a great deal more than depreciation, since there will be a large amount spent on future assets. > But more to the point, what exactly do you think Tesla should have been spending its money on that it didn't? > And let add to my original comment that Tesla also has the Semi going into production later this year, and recently brought out a greatly improved version of its solar roof, and is working like crazy on self-driving. > But back to my question: what should it have been spending its money on that it didn't? My point is that the PR statements that Tesla releases don't match the financials. It's easy to announce that a factory is being built or a new car is going into production, but we should be extremely skeptical of these statements when they aren't backed up by audited financial information. Generally when investing in a company you should look at their financials first, as they are going to be the most honest, and PR statements/rumors last, as they will be the least honest. woodandsteel on Feb 5, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] >My point is that the PR statements that Tesla releases don't match the financials. It's easy to announce that a factory is being built or a new car is going into production, but we should be extremely skeptical of these statements when they aren't backed up by audited financial information. Oh dear, are you saying that Tesla did not actually recently open a new factory in Shanghai, or start a new one outside Berlin? In spite of all the news stories and announcements by the governments in each of the countries. And ditto it has not been developing the Y in spite of all the reported sightings? Or that the new version of the solar roof did not go into production, in spite of all the reviews of it, and all the people who have said they have ordered one? It is all an extremely elaborate hoax? And even when their latest quarterly report discusses all this? You know, when someone is so far gone into conspiracy theories as you appear to be, there is no reasoning them. xkjkls on Feb 6, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] How many of these things exist currently? As far as I know I’ve only seen a total of 10 deliveries from the Chinese factory, there has not been a single Model Y sold to the public yet, the German factory hasn’t even broken ground, and the Solar Roof, despite being in production for three and a half years still hasn’t had even a thousand customers install yet. Companies exaggerate in their PR statements. It’s very easy to claim a factory is complete but not have meaningful production. It’s very easy to claim that the Model Y is just around the corner. It’s apparently very easy to bilk investors that solar roofs are beyond a concept phase for three plus years. That doesn’t mean they are. It’s not a conspiracy theory to want a company to produce audited financials that show that they have done the complete investment in all of these projects and they aren’t vaporware. optimiz3 on Jan 30, 2020 [flagged] | root | parent | prev | next [6 more] Our TSLA brokerage accounts thank you and your /r/RealTesla brethren for your sacrifice. dang on Feb 1, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Please don't post unsubstantive and/or flamewar comments. https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html xkjkls on Jan 30, 2020 [flagged] | root | parent | prev | next [4 more] Well, let's check back next year.

Enjoy popcorn on the sidelines until people start pricing in financial reality.  Manias sometimes take a while to fizzle out.

As more and more short sellers choose (or are forced) to close their positions, they drive the value of the stock higher and make it harder for other shorts to maintain their positions. With 20% of the float still sold short, I personally don’t think $TSLA has hit its peak yet, although the stock price will probably recede as short interest approaches normal levels (1-2% of the float) xkjkls on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] If they are still a company still trading at the multiples they are, short interest is never going to be 1-2% mitchellgoffpc on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Yeah probably true, I did say “approaches” though! My guess is that short interest will eventually drop below 5% over the next couple years if Tesla continues to perform well and grow their revenue stream, but we’ll see. stellar678 on Jan 29, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] I dunno. My bullish view has more to do with Tesla using the vehicle market as an entry point to the broader energy market. If the Tesla cars start throwing off profit and make the company self-sustaining, their vertically-integrated energy thing opens the kind of insanely huge global energy market. They're not just going to eat Ford's lunch - but also Chevron, Saudi Aramco and your local energy company. mdasen on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I think you've hit the nail on the head for the bullish Tesla case.  I don't think there's enough profits in the automotive industry for Tesla to be worth $105-120B.  Sure, Toyota is worth more, but basically no one else is and Tesla is a long time from being the next Toyota and I think the odds of them becoming the next Toyota have to be below 50% and are realistically probably more like 5-10%.  That's not a dig at Tesla, just a recognition that there may never be another Toyota (just as no one has been dominant at anything like Microsoft was with Windows in the 90s) and even if there is another Toyota, it's a long shot that Tesla will be there. I think Tesla might run into issues around energy regulation.  They are working on energy storage and solar, but we'll have to wait and see how that turns out in the market.  Energy companies are highly regulated and generally provide highly reliable service.  This comes with costs like running higher than you can actually charge for so you don't get outages, employing a lot of people for emergency response and storms, etc.  What happens when solar roofs get covered with snow and don't work as well?  If the utility company is tasked with making sure they have enough generation power to cover that, then we'll still need to pay them for the investment even if we're using our solar roofs 90% of the time.  We're already seeing net metering going out of fashion as the unpredictability of it doesn't help utility companies lower their costs enough. Would Tesla be willing to also go into the generation and transmission side of things?  It's definitely possible, but that's also difficult.  Generation is easier since they could just set up solar arrays and batteries and sell into the grid.  However, that still means customers paying the transmission company.  It's possible that you're talking about the generation side and Tesla could tackle that a lot easier.  In terms of the transmission side, they'd probably have to start buying utility companies which don't come cheap. I think it's more likely that Tesla will sell tech to transmission companies and solar roofs and small batteries to individuals.  I think there's still a lot of money and environmental benefit there, but I think transmission companies are going to stick around.  It's a good business if you're just looking for standard return-on-investment, but it also requires dealing with a lot of regulation and communities that end up hating on you. -- In terms of Tesla being up so much, it's a bit surprising.  Automotive revenue is basically flat year-over-year.  Total revenue is up only 2%.  So, Tesla isn't really growing.  By contrast, Apple's revenue was up 9% year-over-year and Apple is solidly profitable today.  Assuming that Tesla continues having profitable quarters, their PE ratio would be around 250 which would be fine if they were growing revenue rapidly. On the plus side, Model 3 production and sales are up over 40% YoY which is excellent, but it's clear why revenue is flat: Model S/X sales are down significantly and they carry a high price tag.  For every three Model 3 sales, they lost a Model S/X sale.  That's certainly to be expected.  The Model 3 is really nice.  However, it does mean that revenue is flat. As a car offering, I like the Model 3.  However, I don't know if demand will continue to increase.  How many people want to spend $40k on a car - and specifically a Tesla Model 3?  Will there be some hockey-stick like growth in revenue?  Probably not.  Profits?  Maybe.  Tesla's vertical integration might pay long-term dividends.  Maybe they can spend less developing things they've already paid for or maybe they can keep spending on R&D and really outpace the industry. Still, it seems unlikely that they will grow more than 10x their current size in the automotive industry.  That's not a dig at Tesla.  If they're pushing out around 600k cars this year, becoming 10x the size would put them in the same place as Ford and GM.  A 17x increase would make them larger than Toyota.  But that's going to take time.  It looks like Tesla is looking to increase production capacity by 15.6% in 2020 (from their slides).  At that rate, it would take 20 years to match Toyota's capacity (starting from 640k production capacity and compound expanding at 15.6% per year for 20 years). Maybe Tesla can expand faster than that, but that would also likely require moving into lower cost/margin vehicles, many more types of vehicles, etc.  Toyota has 17 US vehicles not including variants like hybrid vs non-hybrid not to mention many more for other markets and not including things like Lexus - Lexus adds another 12 models, not counting variations like hybrid vs non-hybrid. And I'm not saying that Tesla isn't going to do that.  However, I think it's going to take a long time and a 20-year horizon (and the risk involved in money that might materialize in 20 years) deserves a discount compared to money that's actually being earned today. You might totally be right that Tesla will not only eat Ford and GM's lunch, but also energy companies.  However, that future is likely 20 years away with a lot of risk between now and then.  Musk has been very upfront that electric vehicles are easier to make than ICE cars.  Other auto makers are creating good electric vehicles except they won't offer enough range because batteries are expensive.  When batteries become cheaper, will competition limit Tesla's automotive expansion?  I think they'll still be highly successful, but what happens when Toyota or Volkswagen puts their full weight behind battery-powered cars?  Some people will surely buy them instead of Teslas.  At some point, if battery-powered cars are our future, Tesla will clash head-on with Toyota.  Toyota is so good at manufacturing.  Even if Tesla is good, Toyota is likely to find ways to capture a lot of the market.  Heck, if electric cars are more reliable as Musk touts, what happens when people double the lifespans of their cars?  That's a much smaller customer base to be selling to. Again, I want to emphasize that Tesla is doing well, but anything with a long time horizon has all sorts of things that can happen in the interim and Tesla is playing a long game and going up against a lot of established incumbents and that means risk.  I don't think it means risk of bankruptcy or anything like that, but there's a big difference between Tesla's current market cap (around $115B in after-hours trading) and ending up as the next Mazda (a solid, profitable, and well-respected auto maker) that's only worth $6B.  Even if they're the next VW (the second largest auto maker sitting just behind Toyota), VW is only a $95B company - and there's a lot of risk between now and Tesla selling 10M cars per year.  Likewise, there's a lot of incumbents, competition, and risk between Tesla's current solar and storage deployments and eating energy companies' lunch. reitzensteinm on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I have to say, thank you for this thoughtful post. Tesla is one of the most compelling stories to follow in recent years, but it seems like moderates have been pushed out and discussions have devolved in to Tesla is a fraud vs Hodl to the moon, with both sides cherry picking facts so hard it's mildly impressive. So the above is a breath of fresh air, and I'd love to read more in depth takes from others  whether I agree with them or not. electriclove on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I agree with the other comment, great post! Tesla is doing amazing work (and I'm a fan, owner, shareholder, yada yada) but the stock price currently is disconnected from fundamentals. That said, it could definitely continue to stay disconnected from fundamentals for a very long time. I believe Tesla will only show modest profits for the near future. They are going to continue reinvesting to push out more product lines (Cybertruck, Semi, ??) and that will take time. Their mission is not to make the most money. Their mission is to accelerate the move to EVs and solar. They'll show some modest profits, hopefully get added to the S&P 500, and maybe the stock will become less volatile. zaroth on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Automotive revenue is basically flat year-over-year. Total revenue is up only 2%. So, Tesla isn't really growing.... On the plus side, Model 3 production and sales are up over 40% YoY which is excellent, but it's clear why revenue is flat: Model S/X sales are down significantly and they carry a high price tag. For every three Model 3 sales, they lost a Model S/X sale. That's certainly to be expected. The Model 3 is really nice. However, it does mean that revenue is flat. In Q4 2018 they sold 27,607 S/X, and in Q4 2019 they sold 19,475 (-8132, 29%). In Q4 2018 they sold 63,359 M3, and in Q4 2019 they sold 92,620 (+29,261, 46%). Vehicle production over the trailing 12 months increased from ~245k to 365k (~50%). Why didn't revenue grow? It's not just the 8,000 fewer Model S/X, because S/X doesn't cost 3.6x a Model 3. Just as important was the ASP of the Model 3 fell... about $7,500 to be precise. > If they're pushing out around 600k cars this year, becoming 10x the size would put them in the same place as Ford and GM. A 17x increase would make them larger than Toyota. But that's going to take time. It looks like Tesla is looking to increase production capacity by 15.6% in 2020 (from their slides). Tesla says their current production capacity is 640k vehicles (I was surprised by this - it's well beyond the promised "500k run rate by the end of 2019", so I think we're seeing the full effect of Giga Shanghai turning on here). By mid-2020 Tesla has said they will be running at a 740k annualized production rate based on added Fremont capacity for Model Y. They have said they intend to increase Model 3 capacity in Shanghai and have at least equivalent capacity for Model Y starting in 2021. That means Shanghai + Fremont will be producing nearly 1m annually in 2021. Now, at that point Berlin will be coming online, which is planned to produce 500k units/year. The upshot I think is that production capacity is increasing at a rate of 40-50% year-over-year -- I'm not sure where you got 15.6% from. > Even if they're the next VW (the second largest auto maker sitting just behind Toyota), VW is only a $95B company - and there's a lot of risk between now and Tesla selling 10M cars per year. Many people confuse market cap with enterprise value. VW enterprise value is $255B vs $110B for Tesla. You have to subtract the outstanding debt, of which Tesla has very little compared to most automakers, before you get down to Market Cap, which is the value remaining for the shareholders. All that said, it is clear that the current valuation of Tesla has ceased to be based purely on fundamentals. Rebelgecko on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] >This comes with costs like running higher than you can actually charge for so you don't get outages, employing a lot of people for emergency response and storms, etc. That's an interesting point. During/after the worst of the recent California drought years, some water companies had to raise their rates because people were so good at saving water. Because so many of the utility company's expenses are fixed costs, their savings from not distributing as much water weren't proportional with their reduction in revenue. wcarron on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I wouldn't hold your breath on that. stellar678 on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I was actually expecting a pretty big drop today given the huge recent runup, so it's fair to say that my breath is not held. But it's the long term I care about, and I'm fairly confident that Tesla is well-positioned for the direction things are headed. Electricity (and solar in particular) - Continually reducing production costs on a resource that is unlimited, at least from the perspective of our planet. Fossil fuels - Continually increasing costs as resources are depleted and externalities are accounted for. I guess you can tell where my chips are. :-) xkjkls on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Tesla’s Solar deployments declined YoY as their recent report indicated natmaka on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Indeed. At the very least Tesla (and any similar 'electricity' co) already benefits from policies geared toward limiting greenhouse gases (and various 'pollutants') emissions, and as those will probably ramp up, will benefit more and more from them. But there may be more, maybe even much more. The gorilla in the room is the fact that solar (nor wind) energy cannot deliver 100% of the time. Any intermittent energy source has to be compensated.  On a grid in order to provide the necessary 'baseload'.  On most autonomous locations because people don't want or cannot wait for power, they want to switch it ON and immediately enjoy the ride. At any moment delivering power to a non-producing geographical zone may be done thanks to power produced in other areas, or (this not a XOR!) by storing energy. From a practical viewpoint a mix of sources (windfarms, geothermal...) and interconnecting grids (forming a continental-scale supergrid) are mandatory, and in many nations there are massive investments towards all this, boosting 'distributed generation' (mainly wind energy, various other forms of renewables, long-distance transmission (see high-voltage, direct current (HVDC)))... Tesla ability to deploy supercharger networks in many countries ties them with local folks in charge of the gridpower.  They know about local energy storage (batteries, which will not be only useful for the car).  They also explore distributed generation (Solarglass roof).  The necessary smartgrid is mainly tied to operational research and IT (Tesla knows about those)... In summary Tesla knows about a fair part of many pertinent domains, at worse as an integrator. Moreover Tesla stands nearby the consumer (mindshare). Therefore Tesla may become the most prominent ultimate link to the customer when it comes to electric power (which will become more and more pervasive as policies geared toward limiting effects of climate change will phase out fossil fuel), enabling them to rack-up a fair part of the benefits from more and more massive infrastructure-oriented investments. xkjkls on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] They’re energy business (SolarCity) has declined every year since they bought it. They’ve lost significant market share in the rooftop Solar market, and the market has started to move away from rooftop solar in favor of large Solar farms in general.

You mean Tesla is going to run power plants and transmission lines?  Both are highly regulated, including the price you can charge, with a very low profit margin in most cases, not sure Musk would be a fan. stellar678 on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I agree that Tesla is unlikely to be interested in playing directly in a tightly regulated market as a utility. But they are happy to sell solar and storage to utilities, to the extent that power grids still provide useful services. (And I definitely believe they do...) See: https://www.tesla.com/utilities I also think that consumer 'behind the meter' solar generation and battery (or other) storage tech will also capture a lot of value that goes to utilities right now. slg on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Tesla's products allow for decentralized power.  A Tesla solar panel feeds into a Tesla battery which powers your Tesla car and the rest of your house.  That all works without Tesla building power plants or transmission lines. justapassenger on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > Tesla solar panel It's actually Panasonic solar panel + SolarEdge inverter, that Tesla puts their sticker on.

Why do we believe Tesla is on the right side of this? AnthonyMouse on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I don't know if it's fair to say that it's moving away from decentralized installations. There were a lot of subsidies for home solar when solar wasn't competitive on its own. Now the subsidies are gone but the panels cost less. In the new context a large solar installation connected to the grid is more cost effective if you need a grid for nighttime . The real question is whether batteries will make it so you don't need that. They're currently too expensive for that, but they're also declining in price. So if batteries get cheap enough that you can run your home from local panels and batteries without needing the grid, the cost of needing to keep the grid when you could otherwise not have it anymore makes the centralization lose its cost advantage. natmaka on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] In many nations solar power is subsidized, more often than not in an administratively burdening way (paperwork!), and subsidies/regulation were frequently modified, discouraging the average citizen. A prominent case is France. This is IMHO at least partly crony capitalism at work.  However it is only temporary and doesn't magically suppress benefits tied to local production. xkjkls on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Industrial solar generally has much less maintenance costs than distributed. There’s some exceptions, Hawaii for instance, but it’s very expensive to have to constantly maintain solar panels in peoples homes in ways that industrial solar isn’t natmaka on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Many setups I saw (PV) are mainly maintained by being washed by rain, and I fail to understand why the maintenance of a (non obsolete) home solar panel would be expensive (neglecting vandalism/theft)(?) Moreover energy produced by solar panels in homes is locally consumed, therefore there is no maintenance (nor any non-neglectable cost or loss) related to distribution (they are non neglectable). xkjkls on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Solar panels and accompanying equipment break. It’s much easier to maintain a centralized installation than having people need to travel for service. natmaka on Jan 31, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Home thermo solar (solar water heating) sometimes breaks (pump...) but a home setup is so simple many owners can repair it themselves, and nearly all can easily find a local serviceman, a competent plumber can tackle most problems. As for photovoltaic a home system seems very robust to me, even serious hail cannot damage it (some windshields will break under it way before the panels!). I completely fail to see even a single and most prominent problem. In a sunny geographical zones there usually are many user, and a is local service offering. heisenbergs on Jan 29, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] simple back of the envelope calculation: in 3 years time, they will have 3 giga factories (+1 in upstate new york), each of which should be scale to 500k cars. at an average resale price of $50k (might be a little lower, but let's keep it simple), that's $75B in revenue. at a 10% profit margin, that's $7.5B profit. let's presume a 20x factor as a growth stock, you have an evaluation of $150B, which it's currently trending to. This is excluding any other growth opportunities (self driving, solar, battery storage, drive train). just plain car sales... saghm on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] This also assumes that there's demand for all of these $50,000 cars, which isn't necessarily the case. mitchellgoffpc on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The base Model 3 costs $40k in the US, and even without any extra options at all, it’s a great car to drive IMO!

The market did not expect the company to cease operations and that was particularly not the expectations baked into this quarterly result (the bar Tesla had to jump over this quarter). A small group of agitator shorts pushed that narrative, which very little of the market actually believed as witnessed by Tesla's persistently outsized market value (pre rally it was still worth more than Ford). Companies the size of Tesla don't trade with $40-$50 billion market caps when the market actually thinks they're going to stop operating soon. xkjkls on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] No? The market expectations were a EPS if 1.76 this quarter. Tesla best that, but acting like the market expected them to go under is ridiculous.

Deliveries expected to start before the end of Q1. Exciting stuff! DennisP on Jan 29, 2020 | parent | next [–] I was happy to see they'd increased range to 315 miles. mikorym on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] That's 507 km, which is starting to become an acceptable range in countries where you tend to travel longer distances. pedrocr on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The model 3 and S already have that range or more. You'll only get ~350km out of that at highway speeds though. The supercharger network makes it perfectly reasonable but it's not yet ideal. Other EVs tend to be far behind still. Most can't charge fast enough and even the ones that do don't have enough charging infrastructure in most places. We're getting very close to mass adoption but will still need 5-10 years more depending on location to get enough battery improvement and charging deployment to make it a no-brainer to get the EV over the pretty good plugin-hybrid models that exist right now. torpfactory on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Depends on the definition of highway speeds a bit. At 60mph I hit the rated range pretty much dead on (500km/310mi). At 75mph it’s probably between 350 and 400km. Generally agree about the charging infrastructure. Personally I have fun trying to find where I can connect to the grid but I don’t think everyone would call that fun... Round numbers: I think when there are ~2-3x the number of supercharger locations (not chargers but locations), it will basically be at parity with the convenience of gas. I believe range (500km @ 60mph) is already acceptable and if the number of locations is increased it will be even less of an issue. Just my $.02 pedrocr on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Sure, given the context being in kilometers instead of miles I was using the ~130km/h that is common in a lot of European highways. From experience that gets you less than 350, particularly in winter. Some places (and drivers) are quite a bit faster still. US highways have fairly low speed limits and so range is less of an issue. True parity with gas will take a much longer time. My previous diesel car had almost 4 times the range and could be refueled in 5 minutes. But there are other advantages that cover for that. Which is why my estimate is that 5-10 years depending on location is what will be needed for both the offer of models and the charging infrastructure to all be in place. qqqwerty on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] As a counter point, my current gas powered car only gets about 240mi/385km in range. And my car before that was 300mi/480km. So compared to that a 300mi range is perfectly adequate. jsight on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] OTOH, they killed the RWD version. That likely would have had an even longer range, and certainly had a lower cost. xeromal on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I used to think the same as you but it's not exactly what you think. The front motor is a bit smaller than rear so at cruising speeds on the highway, the rear motor disengages and the front can handle the speed while using less KW even with the added weight of the extra motor. jsight on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] That has been true in the past with the S & X, but the motors on the 3 (and presumably Y) are a bit different. The RWD 3 was slightly more efficient than the AWD. new_realist on Jan 29, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] The Y will mostly cannibalize 3 sales, but will be good for a few quarters’ pop. reaperducer on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] That Model A is going to cannibalize Model T sales, but it will be good for a few quarters' pop.

Tesla isn't. adventured on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] False. Tesla earned a net and operating profit this quarter and last and looks set to continue the trend toward consistent profitability as they roll out their more profitable position in China. They've reached a sales scale where their operating income is annualizing to well over a billion dollars per year. Operating income was $359 million this quarter, and $620 million combined for the two most recent quarters. Free cash flow for the quarter was a billion dollars. They're sitting on $6.2 billion in cash now. reitzensteinm on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] While you can easily make a good argument that Tesla will be profitable from now on based on extrapolation, given that they lost money ($862 million) in 2019 your declaration of "False." like it's an open and shut case is misplaced (and rude). Parent cherry picked the facts for his argument, you cherry picked yours, neither of you have objective truth on your side. FWIW, I lean towards your argument more than theirs. xkjkls on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] You're quoting non-GAAP numbers. It isn't an achievement to make money just by paying people in stock. Cash flow is also inflated by the use of long-term leases. Tesla lost $800 million this year. That should be the focus. jsight on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think so too, and I think they know that. It sounds like they are "only" planning to ramp US production from the current rate of ~400k total units per year to just over 500k per year. Of course, with China coming online, that still leaves a net increase. It sounds like they may have backed away from some of the more extreme high end projections for the Y. It looks like worldwide production may double within 1-2 years, though. xkjkls on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] According to their own figures, they have capacity to produce 650K, but only project 500K deliveries next year.

On the one hand, Y is a less expensive X. On the other hand, Y is a bigger 3 with a hatch back. I'm not an expert in automotive consumer behavior, but I have to imagine that Y will cannibalize some amount of 3 sales. I also don't think that will matter that much - there is so much demand for Tesla vehicles that they are battery limited. manmal on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Also, Ys are more expensive, meaning an increased bottomline if they really displace 3s. xkjkls on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Increasing the top line, not necessarily bottom line. There is nothing to indicate that Ys have better margins than 3s. tgma on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] There's some evidence: pretty much same platform as 3 should imply roughly the same cost structure for the Y.  That+higher price implies higher margin. It would be akin to Performance Model 3 in that sense. xkjkls on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] There is still more material in the Y than the 3. That doesn't seem to indicate better margins manmal on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] But they might have reduced the number of stamped parts by an order of magnitude, improved wiring in a revolutionary way (there’s a patent by Tesla for that), MUCH less R&D and production setup than model 3 (they won’t make all the mistakes twice),... and let’s not forget economies of scale, they will produce more Y than 3. xkjkls on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] All of this is theoretical and we don't have any real data on how it will affect gross margins. When the car is larger, many things are going to be more costly, like painting, which takes up a significant part of automotive margins. Melting_Harps on Jan 30, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] >  I thought the Y was most similar to the X? Am I missing something? The Y is a crossover SUV like the X, but based off the Model 3 platform/chassis; what I'm really surprised by is the notion that they will build these in Fremont! I actually interviewed at the Fremont Factory in '17 in logistics, the factory was a at Max capacity even with the low 3 numbers being produced. In 18-19 they hit their stride and started to use auxiliary lots: https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/found-a-lot-of-model... They stated that at full capacity and with a successful ramp up 3 would overwhelm their storage capacity, so turn around was critical with little to margin for error; if anyone remembers all the Tesla employee parking lots were full and created a parking nightmare. Well, the outbound deliveries were equally bad. The shutdowns and refitting of the assembly lines showed just how drastic things were for a while. They overcame this and I'm glad they did as they are now offering the 35k base model 3 as was announced in the beginning which was the 'game changer,' but I'm also glad I turned down the offer in the end, especially because they don't seem to be utilizing their Sparks and Shanghai factory for this model which would probably be best as S/X/3 are still being made in Fremont. Then again that stock price leap to 600 is pretty nice, just not worth the stress induced heart attack or stroke at 40. I wonder where Semi/Roadster II/Cybertruck are being made then. I honestly thought they'd consider doing the Roadster II at Fremont for that extra 'Made in California' cache to match its price tag, but not the Y. QuotedForTruth on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Its pretty in between as far as size goes.  But it shares many parts with the 3 and most importantly is much closer to the 3 on price.  The 3 Dual Motor Long Range is about $48k and the Y is $50k.  The X Dual Motor Long Range is $80k. So if it will probably take some sales from both the 3 and X.  But X sales aren't very significant compared to 3 sales anyway. xkjkls on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] In terms of margin the X sales are still significant. S/X sales are still the only thing that provides any consistent profit to Tesla. xkjkls on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] It's similar to a 3 and the X. Basically, the question is whether there are a large number of customers not buying Tesla's because an affordable model without 7 seats doesn't exist. From there, you have to question how many people who are currently deciding on 3s would decide to buy Ys. pkulak on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] If that was a bad thing, no auto manufacturer would have more than one model. irjustin on Jan 29, 2020 | prev | next [–] Congrats to the whole Tesla team + SpaceX.

Marginally profitable for 2019, but R&D was cut by more than the difference between last year's loss and this year's profit. Still $26 billion in long term debt, up a bit from last year. Not clear on the terms on that. They had to agree to some awful terms about two years ago, but dodged the bullet on some of those.

On a related note: FB has been profitable for years, is growing earnings each year by more than 20% and just beat wall street expectations, which wall street rewards with -6% on after-markets trading. Huh?! adventured on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Facebook is getting punished based on expectations. Investors were looking for indications of faster growth and better margins. Expenses skyrocketed 51% in 2019, while sales growth is running closer to half that and looks permanently trapped under 30%, which is combining to crush their profit margin. The market never likes to see a company like Facebook lose margin so rapidly. Their margin fell from 45% to 34% for 2018 vs 2019. Investors are going to want to see that stop falling sooner rather than later. After the big FB rally, the report was mostly underwhelming. Entirely different expectations on the shoulders of FB vs Tesla at this juncture of their operational histories. jrbuhl on Jan 29, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] In the document "GAAP gross profit of $4.1B remained essentially flat in 2019 compared to 2018.

This is just my opinion: The way people were valuing Tesla is a massively valuable stock with a high potential of blowing up. From the looks of things, Tesla has crossed into prolonged profitability. It's not a huge increase in revenue, but it is a big decrease in the chance of bankruptcy. Additionally, because Tesla can self fund and doesn't have to rely on the markets to raise money, they don't have to care very much about short sellers driving the price down. The bull case (robo-taxis, etc.) is still there, but the chance of Tesla going bankrupt is much lower than 1 year ago, so the stock has shot up. xkjkls on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > From the looks of things, Tesla has crossed into prolonged profitability How? They lost $800 million in 2019. > Additionally, because Tesla can self fund and doesn't have to rely on the markets to raise money, they don't have to care very much about short sellers driving the price down.

Of course the counterpoint is that they were profitable both the 3rd and 4th quarter. > They still have increasing bills and huge liabilities. That is true. However, some of their debt will convert into equity as long as the stock price remains where it is. More broadly, I'm not trying to convince anyone that Tesla is some sort of value stock. It's not. It's absurdly volatile. There's also a good chance that they won't win the race to level 5 autonomy. All I'm saying is: enough people believe in the upside and think the downside has been diminished sufficiently to drive up the price to where it is. Maybe they're wrong. Maybe they're right. I certainly don't know. xkjkls on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > Of course the counterpoint is that they were profitable both the 3rd and 4th quarter. Less so than last year.

Everyone else is tapped out, while there’s still a whole lot of people left on Earth who’ll buy Tesla products (and you’ll notice Tesla keeps changing where the production firehose is pointed based on local incentives maximizing sales). Heck, Fiat has to hand over almost $2B to Tesla just to be permitted to sell cars in Europe because they have little to no low or zero emissions vehicles to sell. As an investor desperate for returns, do you invest in the past or the future? aguyfromnb on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > They’re growing while the market for legacy automakers is shrinking. Do you have data for this? Tesla had, essentially zero growth in the US in 2019, which is where it sells half of its cars. There are many companies that had higher growth than that, including Volvo, which grew 10% in the US.  LandRover sold 125k units in the US in 2019, which is far more than the Model S + X (its competitors). So, I'm not sure where you get the idea that everyone else is shrinking while Tesla is growing.  Some companies might be, but some are growing faster than Tesla.  These are not mysteries; there is data out there. jsight on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Tesla delivered ~250k cars in 2018 and ~360k cars in 2019. In the 4th quarter, they had a run rate of >400k, and it is expected that 2020 will produce at least 500k. I'm purely focused on why people see it as a growth story, despite some numbers implying otherwise. Its a drop in the bucket compared to the rest of the industry, so I wouldn't expect it to be possible to tease out the impact on other manufacturers in a reliable way. hw on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] The growth will come from China, where there's still plenty of EV incentives by the government.

He can achieve things that conventional companies can't even dream of. If he needs money he can do a publicity stunt and collect the money.

But on Jan 1 they were selling for ~$5/share, and tomorrow morning it looks like they will be worth maybe $150/share. 30x in a month for a True Believer -- sure wish I had done it!

But there are also folks who have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Survivorship bias. tempsy on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] OK...? I said nothing about the fact there are many more people who lost money or that this isn't akin to gambling. But there are few investments outside of options that can turn a few hundred dollars into $1M in a matter of weeks. TacoToni on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] wow, you werent kidding. some folks made out like bandits. what a rush. qaq on Jan 29, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] how is that tracked? tempsy on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] how is what tracked? buryat on Jan 29, 2020 | parent | prev [–] theta will crush em tempsy on Jan 29, 2020 | root | parent [–] lol theta will not crush anyone who jokingly bought $420 and $690 options after last fall's earnings where the stock jumped to $320.
