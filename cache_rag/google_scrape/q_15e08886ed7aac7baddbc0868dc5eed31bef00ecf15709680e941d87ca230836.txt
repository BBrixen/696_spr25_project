It is the fifth main installment in the Animal Crossing series outside of Japan. In a departure from previous titles in the series, the player lives on a deserted island rather than in a town (referred to as the "Nook Inc. Deserted Island Getaway Package"), which can develop into a town-like community as players progress through the game. Crafting from Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp has also returned in this installment in the form of the DIY system, along with expanded customization of furniture and the player characters. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a critical and commercial success, having received positive reviews from critics and selling 47.44 million copies as of December 2024, making it the best-selling game in the Animal Crossing series and the second best-selling Nintendo Switch game behind Mario Kart 8 Deluxe .

Early development of Animal Crossing: New Horizons began shortly after the Japanese release of New Leaf , before the development of the Nintendo Switch . [2] Aya Kyogoku reprised her role of director following New Leaf , with Hisashi Nogami serving as producer. Kyogoku stated that the developers chose to be ambitious, despite not knowing anything about the hardware that the game would be released on. [2] Full development on New Horizons likely began towards the end of 2016, following the release of the Welcome amiibo update and unveiling of the Nintendo Switch . Game design [ edit ] Game director Aya Kyogoku explained that the development team intended for the game to be welcoming for veteran players and accessible for new players by keeping much of the core gameplay from previous titles while adding many new elements. [2] Kyogoku noted that some players of previous entries would have difficulty finding goals or objectives. As a response to this feedback, a sense of purpose was purposely developed by having players develop the village from scratch. New Horizons sees the addition of crafting to the main-series. The developers felt that as players constructed their village from the ground up, they would grow a more personal relationship with their town. [3] The theme of developing a town on a deserted island was chosen because the developers believed that breaking away from the tradition of players moving into a village would be a fresh and interesting concept for old players. [2] As a result of choosing a deserted island theme, crafting was added to the game. This was done so that players would have a higher level of interactivity with the deserted island. This would give players a different perspective of the environment that used to be just a visual aspect. [3] Crafting was also developed to keep players from running out of things to do during the hours that their shops are closed. [2] Another of these new features, terraforming, was added in response to unexpected behavior from players in previous games such as resetting towns to receive a desirable town layout. With the introduction of crafting and terraforming, players can be more in control of their island. [2] New Horizons focuses on player freedom and expression. This flexibility in design extends further into player design. Unlike previous games which involved players having to answer a series of questions to determine their appearance, players are now able to freely change their appearance whenever they would like to through the use of mirrors or vanities. In addition to this, several new hair and facial features were added that were not present in previous entries. A gender option, referred to as "style" in English versions, is still present but does not impact the player's appearance or the game in any way other than certain dialogue differences. Kyogoku stated in an interview that this level of player customization is not just about gender, but rather more about individuality, which the development team believed was a growing belief within society. Players are not forced into thinking too much about gender, but the option is still there should they decide to. [2] The addition of the NookPhone was inspired by the belief that phones are essential tools in everyday life. Kyogoku has stated that the NookPhone serves as a source of familiarity between the real world and the game. [3] In another shift from serious tradition, the effects of time traveling were made less impactful. This is in part due to the fact that seasonal events and holidays were not coded into the game from launch and were instead added through future updates. Kyogoku noted that this method of adding events was intended to create unity amongst players. Time traveling was discouraged by Kyogoku and Nogami, though they did not consider it to be a form of cheating. [2] Localization [ edit ] Animal Crossing: New Horizons supports more languages than previous entries in the series, being the first main series game to support the Chinese language since Dòngwù Sēnlín in 2006, [4] New Horizons is also the first main series title since Animal Crossing: City Folk to have two separate localizations for Spanish and French; one for Europe and another for the Americas, although it has been erroneously reported to be the first title to do so in the case of Spanish. [5] [6] It is the first title to include all localizations collectively regardless of regional release, and the first main series title to include Dutch and Russian languages. Unveiling and release [ edit ] The announcement of then-untitled New Horizons . Animal Crossing: New Horizons was officially announced during a Nintendo Direct on September 13, 2018, in tandem with the announcement of Isabelle 's appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a new playable character. The game, at this point still untitled, was originally slated to be released in 2019. [7] During Nintendo's E3 2019 Direct, on June 11, 2019, the first official gameplay trailer for New Horizons was unveiled. The game's title was formally announced, and it was also revealed that the game would be released on March 20, 2020, seeing a delay from its original planned 2019 release date. Nintendo shared that this was "to ensure the game is the best it can be," and President of Nintendo of America, Doug Bowser, stated that a delay was necessary to maintain a healthy "work-life balance" for Nintendo's employees. [8] [9] New Horizons was featured in a Nintendo Direct on September 4, 2019, showcasing new gameplay footage and features in an extended highlight. [10] An Animal Crossing Direct took place on February 20, 2020, [11] showcasing multiple new features of the game, such as terrain editing, additional house customization, and more. Animal Crossing: New Horizons was globally released on March 20, 2020, being the first title in the series to launch simultaneously worldwide on the same date. On October 7, 2022, Nintendo Brasil announced that New Horizons , along with various other first-party Nintendo games, would receive a physical release in Brazil, where games had previously only been released digitally, by the end of 2022. [12] Gameplay [ edit ] Premise [ edit ] Tom Nook asking the player if they have ever used a smartphone . Tom Nook has a new business venture: selling the Nook Inc. Deserted Island Getaway Package, which is sold to the player . The game begins on a nearly deserted island where the player can explore, collect resources, and craft various items (including tools and furniture). The only starting buildings on the island are the player's tent, two villager tents (after the player places them), and the Resident Services tent. The Plaza in front of Resident Services will feature events and visitors. These visitors will have items and services to offer to the player . Donating 5 unique fish and insects to Tom Nook will unlock the ability to place Blathers ' tent. Once Blathers' tent is unlocked, he will give the player a Vaulting Pole to find more creatures and a shovel to excavate Fossils . Donating 15 more unique creatures and appraised fossils to Blathers will unlock the ability to place his museum, at which the player can donate and assess multiple things at a time. To unlock more tools, the player will need to pay off their tent, help Tom Nook build Nook's Cranny , build one bridge, and start three additional housing plots for animal villagers. Isabelle joins the island as Nook's assistant. Once the Resident Services tent is upgraded into a building, Isabelle returns as Nook's assistant, and the player is tasked with improving the island's popularity to draw the attention of K.K. Slider . Nook instructs the player to pick a location for a campsite , then to furnish additional housing plots and increase the island's population, and finally to develop the island to a three-star rating. The player earns the Island Designer app once they obtain a three-star rating, allowing K.K. Slider to perform " Welcome Horizons " on their island. After acquiring the proper terraforming tools with Nook Miles, the app allows players to pave roads (instead of having to place patterns on the ground), as well as modify or add rivers and cliffs. Island lifestyle [ edit ] In addition to earning Bells, the player can also earn Nook Miles , which is a new form of currency that can be exchanged for furniture, Nook-branded apparel, plane tickets to mystery islands, upgrades, and recipes. As in Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer , the game features the ability to place furniture outside. A new vaulting pole tool can be created, giving the ability to vault over rivers, as well as a ladder , allowing the player to climb up cliffs . The first playable character of the island is named the Resident Representative , which occupies a similar role to the mayor in Animal Crossing: New Leaf ; this player controls the pace of the storyline and is the only player that can initiate placement of villager housing plots and infrastructure such as stores, bridges, and inclines (though all players will have access to the Island Designer app once K.K. performs). Additionally, there is a maximum of 10 animal villagers on the island. Resources [ edit ] The player chopping a tree to collect wood. Resources can be collected through various methods, such as chopping at trees with an axe for several types of wood (including wood, softwood, and hardwood), or hitting rocks with a shovel for clay, stone, and ores . Several different types of weeds appear, which can also be used as materials once plucked. With these mechanics, the player can build and develop the island over time. Players are also able to dig up clams in the sand, which can then be used as crafting material to make fishing bait . Additionally, trees and flowers can be picked up with a shovel to be stored in the pocket ; flowers can also be used as crafting material, and picking them will also leave the stems in the ground. Player [ edit ] The player can fully customize their character at the beginning of, and during, the game without restrictions, a first for the Animal Crossing main series. This feature was also present in Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer and Pocket Camp . Customization includes skin tones, gender-neutral hairstyles, and nose shapes. [13] The player characters' overall design is slightly more detailed than in previous titles, featuring a more subdued color scheme and clear hair physics and shaders. The players also appear more expressive, showing a thoughtful expression when selecting items in their pockets, and moving their eyes around to look at nearby villagers and bugs. The player also possesses a new item called the NookPhone , which features multiple different applications that the player can use such as Nook Miles , Rescue Service , Local Play, and more. Multiplayer [ edit ] New Horizons sees the introduction of local co-op multiplayer. Main article: Multiplayer#In Animal Crossing: New Horizons Up to eight players can live on a single island, but only one island can be made per Nintendo Switch. [14] For the first time in the series, four players can play at the same time on a single system, and up to eight can play together through online multiplayer or local wireless. [15] Online play requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. In local multiplayer, the screen boundaries will follow player 1; however, they may transfer their "leadership" to another player at any time. The lead player is the only player able to see notifications after catching bugs or fish. In online play, all players have equal abilities, as in previous games. This also marks the first game where a player's friend cannot modify the island with their shovel or axe unless they are marked as a best friend. Nintendo eShop description [ edit ] Escape to Your Personal Island Paradise Escape to a deserted island and create your paradise as you explore, create, and customize in the Animal Crossing: New Horizons game. Your island getaway has a wealth of natural resources that can be used to craft everything from tools to creature comforts.

Show off your island utopia to family and friends—or pack your bags and visit theirs. Whether playing online or with others beside you, island living is even better when you can share it.

Reception [ edit ] Animal Crossing: New Horizons received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the new entry for retaining the soul of other titles in the series while also providing enhanced visuals and new mechanics. Publication Rating Famitsu 38/40 [16] GameSpot 9/10 [17] IGN 9/10 [18] Metacritic [nb 2] 90% [19] Forbes 10/10 [20] Telegraph 100% [ citation needed ] Nintendo Life 10/10 [21] Pocket Gamer 5/5 [22] Some outlets have attributed some of the success of Animal Crossing: New Horizons to the stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements caused as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic , stating that the game has become a "phenomenon" due to its open-ended and social nature, and citing it as a form of escapism. [23] Ani Bundel of NBC News stated, "In this time of social distancing, it turns out that a trip to a calming island where all you have to do is build houses and plant trees is the perfect escape," and that the game "couldn't have been timed more perfectly," releasing as shelter-in-place orders began to take place in the United States. [24] Sales [ edit ] In the first six weeks after the game's release, New Horizons sold over 13.41 million copies worldwide, surpassing Animal Crossing: New Leaf as the best-selling title in the Animal Crossing series . [25] As of Decemer 31, 2024, the game has sold 47.44 million units worldwide, surpassing the lifetime sales of all previous Animal Crossing games combined and becoming the second best-selling Nintendo Switch title, only behind Mario Kart 8 Deluxe which has sold 67.35 million units. [26] In November 2022, New Horizons reached 10.45 million combined digital and physical copies sold in Japan, surpassing Pokémon Red , Green , and Blue Versions as the best-selling game of all time in the country. [27] In December 2024, the game surpassed Pokémon Red and Green Versions with physical sales alone, reaching over 8 million copies sold and becoming the best-selling physical game of all time in Japan. [28] In the United States, the game became the best-selling in March 2020 and second best-selling in 2020 overall. It achieved the third-highest month physical dollar and unit sales of any Nintendo game and exceeded the lifetime sales of all games in the series. [29] In Europe, New Horizons sold 7 million copies as of March 16, 2021 and was confirmed to be the fastest-selling Nintendo title ever released in the region. [30] Usage in political media [ edit ] The Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign promoting custom designs for the then-upcoming 2020 United States presidential election. The popularity of Animal Crossing: New Horizons , paired with quarantining as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused the game to become prominently used as an online political platform. Months after the game was launched, protestors used New Horizons to protest for Hong Kong democracy against China , even posting derogatory messages pointed at Chinese president Xi Jinping and Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam . The resulting virtual protests caused import copies of New Horizons to be taken off gray market online stores in China. [31] Later that year, Joe Biden's election campaign for the then-upcoming 2020 presidential election in the United States announced in September that it would provide custom designs for New Horizons players. [32] Later in October, the same campaign also launched its own dream island named "Biden HQ." The dream island, accessible through the Dream Address DA-7286-5710-7478, features a recreation of the White House and the Rose Garden , and a voting booth that promotes players to the Democratic National Committee 's voting registration site. The island's player character resembles Joe Biden and when spoken to says, "No malarkey," a slogan used in Biden's presidential campaign. [33] [34] [35] Following its usage by the Biden election campaign, Nintendo released an official New Horizons usage guidelines for companies and organizations, stating that while they can share custom designs or dream islands, they are prohibited from engaging in certain activities, including politics.

Accolades Trivia [ edit ] Animal Crossing: New Horizons marks the longest time between the release of two main Animal Crossing series games, at 7 years, 4 months, and 12 days from Animal Crossing: New Leaf ' s release in Japan on November 8, 2012. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the second mainline game in the Animal Crossing series not to feature K.K. Slider on its boxart, the first being the international release of Animal Crossing . Likely to tie into Animal Crossing: New Horizons' s de-emphasis of gender, villagers with "gendered" catchphrases had their catchphrases changed in this game to use more gender-neutral language. Cole , Cube and Stu , who all formerly included "dude" in their catchphrases, now say "cooooool," "brainfreeze," and "mrooooo," respectively. Shep , who formerly said "baaa man" as his catchphrase, now says "baa baa baa." Fuchsia , whose catchphrase was formerly "girlfriend," now says "precious." These changes were later incorporated into Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp as of version 3.4.0.
