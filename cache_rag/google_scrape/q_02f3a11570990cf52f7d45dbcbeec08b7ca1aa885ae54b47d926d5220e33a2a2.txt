Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP via Getty Images Slovenian powerhouse Tadej Pogaƒçar officially claimed his second Tour de France victory on Sunday after dominating the field for most of the race's three weeks. Pogaƒçar, 22, pulled ahead in the general classification standings on a rainy stage eight and never gave up the leading rider's yellow jersey, winning three of the race's 21 stages. Last year, Pogaƒçar came to an unexpected victory after his rival Primo≈æ Rogliƒç faltered in the penultimate stage time trial. At the time he was the youngest winner of the Tour in 116 years. "I can't compare both Tour de France victories, I can't say which one is more beautiful," Pogaƒçar said, according to The Associated Press. "This time, I took the yellow jersey quite earlier. It has been totally different."

Carapaz is the first Ecuadorian to ever finish in the top three in the Tour's history. Pogaƒçar was a favorite to win going into the race. Rogliƒç, also of Slovenia, was another favorite but was caught up in multiple crashes early in the race and dropped out to recover from his injuries. Mark Cavendish resurrects his cycling career Meanwhile, Mark Cavendish, 36, a native of the Isle of Man, resurrected a career that had seemed to be on a downturn, winning four stages of the Tour.

Thomas Samson/AFP via Getty Images In doing so, Cavendish reached a total of 34 Tour de France stage wins in his career, matching the record set between 1969 and 1975 by Eddy Merckx, who is generally considered the greatest cyclist of all time. Cavendish broke out in tears after his first win of this year's Tour, his first in five years. He was only selected to be on the team at the last minute after another rider's injury. "I didn't think I'd ever get to come back to this race," he said in an emotional post-race interview.
