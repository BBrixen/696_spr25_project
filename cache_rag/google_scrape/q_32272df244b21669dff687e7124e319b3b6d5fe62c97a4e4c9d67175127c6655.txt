Members Online • Cody2Go Going Back to Diablo 3, Post D4 Diablo III TLDR: Old man plays previous version of new video game, has a great time, then lists things he liked about previous video game. He also considers the fact that sometimes sequels are more soft-reboot than genuine mechanical improvement of their predecessor. He’s okay with this, but wanted to post about it anyway. I’ve been killing time waiting on Season 1 of D4 by playing Season 28 of D3. I didn’t start a new character when Season 28 launched, and haven’t played D3 heavily in a few years. Over the past week, I’ve built myself a Paragon 800+ Frost Hydra Wizard, and have to say that after grinding NM dungeons from level 50-80 in D4, I’ve had more fun going back to D3 than I have doing anything post campaign from D4. I’m not going to get into specifics in the initial post, but D4’s endgame feels like a total slog compared to D3, especially paired with the seasonal mechanic, the Alter of Rites. Also, the QoL in D3 blows D4 out of the water in my opinion. As a disclaimer, I don’t hate D4, or think it’s a bad game. I just play a lot of ARPGs, and these are things I’ve noticed. D4 is clearly trying a different thing, and I get that. I’ll play more of it, and I’m sure I’ll have a good time. Things that I think are directly comparable that D3 does better than D4: Kanai’s Cube / Extracting Legendary Powers > Codex of Power / Aspects Legendary Gems > Glyphs Ancient / Primal Ancients > Sacred / Ancestrals Enchanting / Rerolling / Augmenting through Kanai’s Cube > Upgrading / Enchanting gear in D4 Rifts / Greater Rifts > NM Dungeons Seasonal Journey > Regrinding Renown Wardrobe / Armoury in D3 > Wardrobe in D4 Camera FOV in D3 is literally > D4’s (Just let me zoom it out. It zooms out automatically sometimes, just let me do it manually. My character can basically touch the edge of the screen. Why is it like this?) I can elaborate on specifics, and I’m sure I’m missing some, but this is just what comes to mind based of my gameplay so far. Update 1: I think it’s pretty funny that this is being interpreted as a “I’m breaking up with D4” post. It’s not. I’ll be playing Season 1. This post was simply me listing a bunch of things from D3 that I think are good, and that D4 should implement/learn from. If you’re way into D4, this isn’t a personal attack. We’re still cool. The game is still good. Update 2: I’m seeing a lot of “D4 is new, give it time”, and “D3 is 28 seasons deep, so this isn’t a fair comparison”. These are 2 games you can play right now. They exist in parallel. If I’m looking at both experiences as they are today (which is the only way I can play them), one provides (in my opinion) a more enjoyable, focused, and complete experience than the other. I have no doubt that Diablo 4 is going to get better in the future, but we’re not there yet. If you like D4 more than D3, especially the features mentioned above, I’d love to know why. I want both games to be the best versions of themselves. I like Diablo. That includes D4. I just don’t think it’s in a great spot right now. Update 3: I think that my biggest takeaway from this past week is that D3 is a comfort food ARPG. The game seems like it wants you to have a good time. It wants you to get super powerful without a bunch of friction. The game constantly dropping Set/Legendary items shows you what other cool builds you could be using, then lets you switch between loadouts/builds on the fly so you can actually do it. I understand that some people prefer the grind to be stretched out, and you could critique D3 for a lack of challenge/longevity, but personally, I’d rather see all the cool shit in less time, take a break, then do it again on another class the next season. Like it or not, I think D3 knows what it is. It puts you on the Diablo loot treadmill, then turns the speed up to 11. Diablo 4 feels like a bunch of different ideas cobbled together. It’s still good, but I think it has some kinks to work out before we see what D4 will ultimately be. Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
