During this speech, you may have noticed the same two things I did. Firstly, everything was clearly in twenty four frames per second, as if we were watching a film version of the Academy Awards. Steve Soderbergh — the mastermind behind this year’s ceremony — was going to make the Oscars his own, and by golly did he do that. With crazy camera pans, a lack of fluff (for the most part), and a focus on why everyone is in this industry, Soderbergh made Oscars purely about film all over again. Secondly, I was caught off guard when King was zipping right into the nominees for Best Writing (Original Screenplay), and didn’t realize that this would be a different kind of a host-less affair; the last few Oscars have been without a master of ceremonies, but they usually try to pad out their time with skits and other shenanigans. That was barely the case this time. The categories were sped through for the most part, with discussions about each nominee mostly replacing clips from their respective films; a unique, nice touch that may not be for everybody, but it felt special for me. What didn’t get cut short were the speeches, which felt longer than ever, since there wasn’t an orchestra to cut everyone off (Questlove was the disc jockey for the ceremony, and he was feeling courteous enough to wait). Later on, I was very aware of just how strange the layout of the categories was. Chloé Zhao won for Best Directing very early on (within the first five or six nominees, I believe), but her film Nomadland winning Best Picture before Best Actor and Actress were announced may be even stranger. Otherwise, the night was a bit of a meshing of each category, in Soderbergh’s own peculiar way. Musical categories were left until the end. Shorts were spread out. Everything felt so up in the air, which certainly helps the Oscars feel unpredictable to some degree, I suppose. On the topic of unpredictability, Soderbergh knew to have both major acting awards last, as Frances McDormand is now a three time Best Actress winner (and a four time winner, including her producer credit for Nomadland ) and was the sole survivor of the most competitive category of the year. Then, there was Sir Anthony Hopkins, finally securing that second Best Actor award for his brilliant, touching performance in The Father , which will likely land as the biggest shock of the evening (which was saved for last); him beating out Chadwick Boseman’s posthumous nomination for Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom is a bit of a difficult pill to swallow, and likely will be for some time, but it’s Sir Anthony Hopkins, for crying out loud! Another major upset was H.E.R. being able to turn Judas and the Black Messiah into a two time winner for her Best Original Song “Fight For You", but that category was such a toss up anyway. Otherwise, we had business as usual. Daniel Kaluuyah won for Best Supporting Actor ( Judas and the Black Messiah ), and Yuh-Jung Youn for Best Supporting Actress ( Minari ); both winners will be memorable for their speeches (with Kaluuyah discussing his parents having sex to make him being a miracle, and his mother’s baffled live reaction to this, and Youn being the most charming, hilarious speaker of the entire evening in every way). The Academy Awards like having each Best Picture nominee go home with something. Riz Ahmed went home empty handed, but he got to grant his film Sound of Metal with an award for Best Sound; the film would also win for Best Film Editing. Emerand Fennell won Best Original Screenplay for her debut film Promising Young Woman , and The Father secured its second win for the Adapted variant. Mank did reasonably well with two wins back-to-back (Best Production Design and CInematography). Then, there was The Trial of the Chicago 7 : once touted as the possible Best Picture winner, only to be the only nominee of the category to go home empty handed. Other events include Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom and Soul picking up two awards each (Makeup and Hairstyling and Costume for the former, Animated Feature and Original Score for the latter), Tenet continuing Christopher Nolan’s Oscar history with a win for Visual Effects, and the three short films ( Colette for Documentary (Short Subject), If Anything Happens I Love You for Animated Short, and Two Distant Strangers for Live Action Short). Bryan Cranston provided the MPTF with an honourary Oscar (the first time the award went to a company and/or institution and not a person), and Viola Davis gave her friend Tyler Perry his own Oscar as well; Perry gifted the evening with a loving speech that ranks up there as one of the best of the night.  Another speech worth mentioning was that of Thomas Vinterberg, whose Another Round won for Best International Feature Film early on; his tribute to his late daughter was an early heartbreaking moment. Overall, the Oscars went kind of as expected: lots of obvious wins, and some major shake ups. As a ceremony, it felt not too shabby. The cinematic quality of the night felt just right, especially since much of the self-patting-on-the-back was replaced with actually interesting tidbits and recollections. Outside of the Best Original Song trivia moment (Glenn Close had to win somehow tonight, and she did so by stealing the moment with her apparent in-depth knowledge of music and her certain funky dance moves), there wasn’t any fluff at all. Considering the social distancing, the ability to have as many nominees there as possible, and the heart that went into the appreciation of film over the celebration of social status, these Oscars were alright. I personally feel like not having Best Picture last was a bit of a stupid decision, to be frank; my guess was that Chadwick Boseman was anticipated to win and was placed last, but you can’t take these gambles (especially since it clearly didn’t pay off, with Hopkins winning and not even being there; Joaquin Phoenix’s worst nightmare of being the sole focus of the Academy Awards came true). Furthermore, it’s the biggest award of the night; why wouldn’t you have Best Picture last? Outside of this one major mess up, I feel like the other bold risks paid off. I’m glad Soderbergh tried something a wee bit different, especially in a time of uncertainty.
