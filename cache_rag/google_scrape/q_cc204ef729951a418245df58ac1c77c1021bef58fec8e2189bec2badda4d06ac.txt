Members Online â€¢ Vokon The Last Of Us Season 2 WGA Strike Question News So I fully support the WGA Strike, those writers are getting underpaid and they should be paid for their hours of writing and entertainment as they are the main reason why we are getting most great shows and movies these days. So this is the part I agree with 100% and the part I understand. But also I want to know, what is also the main reasons for the strike? I heard there are like 3 things the WGA asked for, and the studios refused, and that is why they did the strike. Can someone explain? Because I am a little confused because someone told me that, Season 2 of The Last Of Us will not be delayed since its not a writing room and it's only being written by two people. But at the same time Superman Legacy which is a movie written by James Gunn is only written by him, and they said that if it wasn't for the script being already done, it would have been delayed aswell. Same with House of the Dragon. So I wanted to ask, if everything that is currently being written is delayed and that they stopped working until the strike is over? Like did Neil and Craig stop writing or not? I would really appreciate it if someone explained it to me ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Thank you. Read more New to Reddit?
