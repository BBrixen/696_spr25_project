Spain World Cup Classic teams FEATURES Nostalgia Who were the players who led Spain to their first-ever World Cup win and what has happened to them since? Spain were one of the favourites to lift the World Cup in 2010 heading into the tournament. They had convincingly won Euro 2008 and more or less the same squad was named by manager Vicente del Bosque for the South Africa finals. However, in the very first match, they suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Switzerland, with Gelson Fernandes scoring early in the second half to upset the European champions. Article continues below In the second match, they steadied the ship with a 2-0 victory over Honduras, courtesy of a brace from David Villa, while they beat Chile 2-1 in the final group-stage game to finish as table-toppers. In the quarterfinals, Spain clashed with Paraguay and it was Villa once again who came to the rescue as he scored the winner in the 82nd minute. In the last four, Spain defeated Germany 1-0 with Carles Puyol scoring from a corner to set up a summit clash with Netherlands. In the final, John Heitinga received his second yellow in extra time which left Netherlands with 10 men on the pitch. Spain started attacking with more teeth and finally, in the 116th minute, Andres Iniesta latched on to a ball from Cesc Fabregas and found the far corner to score the winner and give Spain their first and only World Cup trophy to date.
