ABC The season picked up with the doctors at Grey Sloan dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, and Meredith, in particular, was feeling the weight of losing so many patients. ABC And just when the two-hour premiere was about to end, Grey's Anatomy delivered one of its most shocking cliffhangers to date. ABC ^Live look at me crying and screaming. In the final two minutes, Cormac "McWidow" Hayes finds Meredith unconscious in the parking lot after a long day of work. ABC We then see Meredith in a dreamlike state sitting on a beach and we suddenly hear, "Meredith!" ABC Now, this is when I fully dropped to the floor in my living room because I would recognize that voice anywhere. ABC It was Derek "McDreamy" Shepherd waving at Meredith on the beach and the duo shared this truly adorable moment. ABC This is the first time Derek has been seen (in new footage) since his death in Season 11. Now, I know what you're thinking: Meredith seeing Derek CANNOT be good considering he's, well, dead, and Meredith just collapsed. ABC I am literally the opposite of calm right now. So next week's episode picks up where this week left off, with Meredith in the hospital â€” it looks like she has COVID-19 â€” and Derek will still be appearing to her in a dream. ABC I'm having flashbacks to when Meredith saw Ellis and Denny while she was fighting to stay alive after she almost drowned. Talking about Patrick Dempsey's big return with Deadline, Ellen Pompeo revealed that she asked Patrick if he would ever return to the show when they were on a hike together earlier this year. greysabc / Via instagram.com She knew showrunner and executive producer Krista Vernoff had this idea for Meredith's beach dream sequence, so she asked Patrick if he would like to be part of it. Ellen said, "Patrick and I have this chemistry, where I think, even from when we first met, for some reason it just felt like weâ€™ve known each other for a hundred years, and itâ€™s just the same feeling." Vivian Zink / ABC / Getty Images "Itâ€™s like riding a bike, we just have a chemistry and a dynamic thatâ€™s always served us well, and I think we have a genuine affection for each other." greysabc / Via instagram.com Meanwhile, Patrick told Deadline , "It was really enjoyable [getting back into character]. It was really exciting, and fun, and it was great to see everybody." greysabc / Via instagram.com Basically, like me, everyone is freaking out about Derek's return to Grey's Anatomy . Here are some of the best tweets from the cast, the crew, and fans about the moment: 1. shonda rhimes @shondarhimes Thought I would check in on twitter to see if you enjoyed the dreamy gift @KristaVernoff &amp; @EllenPompeo gave to brighten up your 2020... ðŸ˜˜#GreysAnatomy 04:25 AM - 13 Nov 2020 Reply Retweet Favorite shondarhimes / Via Twitter: @shondarhimes 2.
