Yearly summary [ edit ] Early hard court season [ edit ] ATP Cup [ edit ] Rafael Nadal was scheduled to begin his season at the ATP Cup . However, despite being on the Spanish team, he did not play any matches due to minor back issues. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Australian Open [ edit ] See also: 2021 Australian Open – Men's Singles At the 2021 Australian Open , Nadal lost in the quarterfinals to Stefanos Tsitsipas , despite being two sets to love up. This marked only the second time Nadal has lost a grand slam match after being two sets up. [ 3 ] It was overall the third time he lost from 2 sets up, the others happened at the US Open 2015 to Fabio Fognini, and Miami 2005 to Roger Federer in the final when Masters finals were best of 5. Indian Wells Masters [ edit ] Indian Wells Masters was scheduled to take place in March 2021 but was postponed due to coronavirus concerns. [ 4 ] Miami Open [ edit ] Nadal withdrew from the Miami Open . [ 5 ] Spring clay court season [ edit ] Monte-Carlo Masters [ edit ] Nadal won his first two matches losing a total of just 5 games in both combined, but then lost to Andrey Rublev in the quarterfinals in three sets. Barcelona Open [ edit ] Nadal saved a match point to defeat Stefanos Tsitsipas , in 3 hours and 38 minutes, the longest final since 1991 (when records began). This was his record-extending 12th title at the event. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Madrid Open [ edit ] Nadal lost to Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinals. Italian Open [ edit ] Nadal saved two match points to defeat Denis Shapovalov . He then beat Alexander Zverev and Reilly Opelka to reach the final, where he defeated longtime rival Novak Djokovic in three sets. French Open [ edit ] See also: 2021 French Open – Men's Singles At the French Open, Nadal entered as the heavy favorite seeking to become the first man to win 21 majors. He reached the semifinals after wins over Jannik Sinner and Diego Schwartzman, where he encountered Novak Djokovic in a rematch of the previous year's final. There, Nadal was upset by eventual champion Djokovic in four sets, in only his third-ever loss at the French Open. Grass court season [ edit ] Wimbledon [ edit ] See also: 2021 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles Nadal withdrew from both Wimbledon and the Olympics, citing schedule reasons. North American hard court season [ edit ] Washington (Citi Open) [ edit ] Nadal made his Washington debut in 2021.  He faced Jack Sock in his opener, his first match since losing to Novak Djokovic at the French Open.  Nadal recovered from a break down in the third set, prevailing in a final set tiebreak.  He lost in the round of 16 to Lloyd Harris (tennis) in three sets. Following more injury problems, Nadal withdrew from Toronto and Cincinnati, and, on August 20, ended his season, citing his ongoing foot injury as the main issue.
