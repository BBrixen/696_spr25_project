[ 2 ] [ 3 ] As of January 2025, Matsuyama has 20 worldwide wins, an Olympic bronze medal, ten career top-10 finishes in major championships, and six Presidents Cup appearances. Matsuyama is a two-time winner of tournaments in the World Golf Championships , two-time winner of the Waste Management Phoenix Open , eight-time Japan Golf Tour winner, two-time winner of the Asian Amateur Championship , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] and most recently winner of the FedEx St. Jude Championship . [ 6 ] His 11 wins on the PGA Tour make him the most successful Japanese member of the PGA Tour in history. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Matsuyama was ranked first in the World Amateur Golf Ranking in 2012. As a professional, he has been ranked as high as second in the Official World Golf Ranking , doing so in June 2017. [ 4 ] [ 7 ] Early life and amateur career [ edit ] Matsuyama was born on 25 February 1992 in Matsuyama, Ehime , Japan . He was introduced to golf at the age of four, by his father. During eighth grade, he transferred to Meitoku Gijuku Junior & Senior High School in Kochi Prefecture , in search of a better golf environment. Matsuyama studied at Tohoku Fukushi University in Sendai . He won the 2010 Asian Amateur Championship with a score of 68-69-65-67=269. [ 8 ] This gave him the chance to compete as an amateur in the 2011 Masters Tournament , becoming the first Japanese amateur to do so. At the Masters, Matsuyama was the leading amateur and won the Silver Cup, which is presented to the lowest scoring amateur. [ 9 ] He was the only amateur to make the cut. [ 10 ] A week after his victory, he finished in a tie for third at the Japan Open Golf Championship which is an event on the Japan Golf Tour . [ 11 ] In 2011, Matsuyama won the gold medal at the 2011 World University Games . He also led the Japan team to the gold medal in the team event. In October 2011, he also successfully defended his title at the Asian Amateur Championship. [ 12 ] In November, Matsuyama won the Mitsui Sumitomo Visa Taiheiyo Masters on the Japan Golf Tour while still an amateur. [ 13 ] In August 2012, Matsuyama reached number one in the World Amateur Golf Ranking . [ 14 ] Professional career [ edit ] 2013 [ edit ] Matsuyama turned professional in April 2013 and won his second professional tournament, the 2013 Tsuruya Open on the Japan Golf Tour. Five weeks later, Matsuyama won his third title on the Japan Golf Tour at the Diamond Cup Golf tournament. Following a top 10 finish at the 2013 U.S. Open , Matsuyama entered the top 50 of the Official World Golf Ranking . He won his fourth Japan Golf Tour event in September at the Fujisankei Classic . Matsuyama would win his fifth Japan Golf Tour event in December at the Casio World Open . The win also made Matsuyama the first rookie to lead the Japan Tour's money list. 2014 [ edit ] For 2014, Matsuyama qualified for the PGA Tour through non-member earnings. In just seven PGA Tour-sanctioned events, Matsuyama had six top-25 finishes, including a T-6 at the 2013 Open Championship . Matsuyama earned his first PGA Tour win at the 2014 Memorial Tournament , beating Kevin Na in a playoff and moving to a career-high OWGR ranking of 13th. The win was the first for a Japanese player since Ryuji Imada in 2008. In his first full season as a PGA tour member, he finished 28th in the FedEx Cup standings. [ 15 ] Matsuyama would win his sixth Japan Golf Tour event late in the 2014 season. In November, the victory came at the Dunlop Phoenix in a playoff over Hiroshi Iwata . 2015 [ edit ] Matsuyama finished fifth at the 2015 Masters Tournament , the best major finish of his career to that point. [ 16 ] He finished 16th in the FedEx Cup standings. In 8–11 October, he played for the International Team in the 2015 Presidents Cup and went 2–1–1 (win–loss–half). 2016 [ edit ] On 7 February 2016, Matsuyama won the Waste Management Phoenix Open in a playoff with Rickie Fowler . He secured his victory on the fourth hole. [ 17 ] The win moved him to 12th in the Official World Golf Ranking, the highest in his career. On 16 October 2016, Matsuyama captured the Japan Open by three strokes over Yuta Ikeda and Lee Kyoung-hoon . The win was  Matsuyama's first title at his country's national open and his seventh victory in Japan. The title gives Matsuyama victories in four of the Japan Golf Tour 's five ¥200,000,000 events. [ 18 ] On 30 October 2016, Matsuyama followed up his Japan Open triumph by winning the WGC-HSBC Champions , colloquially known as "Asia's Major", in Shanghai . Matsuyama became the first Asian golfer to claim a World Golf Championship since the series was inaugurated in 1999. With the victory, Matsuyama rose to number 6 in the Official World Golf Ranking, his highest position and the second highest ever by a Japanese player after Masashi Ozaki , who achieved a ranking of fifth. [ 19 ] He later moved up to fifth in the world after the Farmers Insurance Open . On 13 November 2016, Matsuyama won his second Taiheiyo Masters , following his victory as a 19-year-old amateur in 2011. He romped to a seven-shot win over South Korea's Song Young-han . [ 19 ] On 4 December 2016, Matsuyama won the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas. 2016 Olympics withdrawal [ edit ] Although he was the highest ranked male Japanese golfer at the time, Matsuyama withdrew from participating in the 2016 Rio Olympic Games out of concern about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic , which caused several of the world's top players to withdraw from the Olympic golf event. [ 20 ] 2017 [ edit ] In Matsuyama's return to the Waste Management Phoenix Open , he again entered a playoff on Sunday to defend his title, this time against Webb Simpson . On the fourth playoff hole, Matsuyama made birdie to win the tournament for the second time in as many years. After finishing second in the 2017 U.S. Open at Erin Hills, while the top three players in the world at the time ( Dustin Johnson , Rory McIlroy and Jason Day ) failed to make the cut, Matsuyama reached 2nd in the Official World Golf Ranking , his highest ever, and the highest ever for a male Japanese golfer. The 2017 season has been a breakthrough year with Matsuyama winning three Tour titles, including his first World Golf Championship , and three second-place finishes in his first 15 events, as well as winning $5,945,990, putting him second on the money list behind Dustin Johnson , before the month of July. He then won the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational in August, shooting a course record-tying 61 in the final round to win by five strokes. [ 21 ] At the 2017 PGA Championship, Matsuyama had opening rounds of 70–64 to share the 36-hold lead, with Kevin Kisner at Quail Hollow. 2019 [ edit ] In December 2019, Matsuyama played on the International team at the 2019 Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne Golf Club in Australia. The U.S. team won, 16–14. Matsuyama went 2–1–1 and halved his Sunday singles match against Tony Finau . [ 22 ] 2021 [ edit ] On 11 April 2021, Matsuyama won the Masters Tournament , becoming both the first Japanese player and the first Asian-born player to win the tournament. He finished with an overall score of 278 (−10), one shot ahead of runner-up Will Zalatoris . [ 23 ] At the conclusion of the tournament, Matsuyama's caddie, Shota Hayafuji, bowed to the 18th fairway of the Augusta course as a gesture of Japanese respect. [ 24 ] In August, Matsuyama finished in a tie for 3rd place at the Olympic Games . He lost in a 7-man playoff for the bronze medal. [ 25 ] The following week Matsuyama was tied for the lead after 72 holes at the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational . He was beaten in the playoff when Abraham Ancer birdied the second extra hole. [ 26 ] In October 2021, Matsuyama won the Zozo Championship at Narashino Country Club . The Zozo Championship is the only PGA Tour event held in Japan. Matsuyama won by five strokes over Cameron Tringale and Brendan Steele . [ 27 ] 2022 [ edit ] On 16 January 2022, Matsuyama won the Sony Open in Hawaii ; having made up a five-shot deficit on the back nine to get into a playoff with Russell Henley , he made an eagle on the first extra hole to claim the victory. It was his eighth win on the PGA Tour, tying K. J. Choi for most tour victories by an Asian-born player. [ 28 ] On 2 June 2022, at the Memorial Tournament at Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, Matsuyama was disqualified midway through his first round due to having a white paint-like substance on the face of his 3-wood. The substance was said to have been applied by his equipment technician to help with alignment. Matsuyama qualified for the International team at the 2022 Presidents Cup ; he won one, tied one and lost three of the five matches he played. [ 29 ] 2024 [ edit ] On 18 February 2024, Matsuyama won the Genesis Invitational . He entered the final round six strokes off the lead, but overcame the deficit, shooting a 62 to win his first PGA Tour event since the 2022 Sony Open in Hawaii . [ 6 ] Matsuyama posted the second-lowest round in course history. It was also the lowest in the fourth round of a tournament at Riviera Country Club . [ 30 ] In August, Matsuyama won the bronze medal at the 2024 Olympic Games . He finished two shots behind Scottie Scheffler , the gold medalist, and one shot behind Tommy Fleetwood , the silver medalist, with a score of 267 (−17). [ 31 ] Later that month, he won the FedEx St. Jude Championship by two strokes with a score of 263 (−17). Matsuyama nearly lost control of a five shot lead in the final round after errant shots on the back nine, but birdies on the last two holes brought him his 10th victory on the PGA Tour. [ 32 ] 2025 [ edit ] In January, Matsuyama won The Sentry , three strokes ahead of Collin Morikawa . His winning score of 35-under 257 broke the PGA Tour scoring record in relation to par, previously set by Cameron Smith in 2022 at 34-under total, also at The Sentry. [ 33 ] Personal life [ edit ] Matsuyama and his wife Mei (married in January 2017) have a daughter born in July 2017. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] After winning a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics in August 2024, Matsuyama became the victim of a robbery in London , while in the city during a layover to Memphis, Tennessee for the FedEx St. Jude Championship . His wallet was stolen, and both his caddie and his coach had their passports stolen. Matsuyama's Olympic medal was not among the stolen items.
