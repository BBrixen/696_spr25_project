Unreleased songs [ edit ] "China Doll" [ edit ] A song titled "China Doll" was featured in the demo versions of the movie, but was replaced with " Honor to Us All " in the final version. [ 8 ] "Keep 'Em Guessing" [ edit ] There is a deleted song aptly called " Keep 'Em Guessing ", which was removed from the film when Eddie Murphy was cast as Mushu. This song was revealed on the Mulan 2-Disc Special Edition but Disney chose not to re-release the soundtrack to Mulan , despite doing so for the soundtracks to Beauty and the Beast , The Lion King , and Aladdin . It was brought back for the Mulan Jr. stage musical. "Written in Stone" [ edit ] " Written in Stone " was originally placed in the section where Mulan questions her identity and decides to write her own destiny rather than succumbing to societal gender roles. It was eventually replaced with "Reflection". Despite originally being a 4-minute power ballad, it is broken up into small pieces and reprised many times throughout the Mulan Jr. stage musical. It is sung by the ancestors in the intro as they explain the family structure of China much like Tradition in Fiddler on the Roof . A later reprise by Mulan demonstrates that she wants her life to be written in stone — but by herself, not by her ancestors.
