His success in college football earned him the Sammy Baugh Trophy and Kellen Moore Award , along with several conference honors. Haskins was selected by the Washington Redskins in the first round of the 2019 NFL draft , but was released after less than two seasons due to inconsistent play and questions over his work ethic. He signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2021 and served as a backup until his death the following off-season when he was fatally struck by a vehicle. Early life [ edit ] Born in Highland Park, New Jersey , Haskins and his family moved to Potomac, Maryland , when he was in the ninth grade. [ 1 ] There, he attended and played football at Bullis School from 2013 to 2016, where he passed for 5,308 yards and 54 touchdowns .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] He claimed the single-season passing and touchdown records for Ohio State and the Big Ten by eclipsing the 4,000-passing yards mark and throwing 50 touchdowns, making him just one of eight NCAA quarterbacks to ever achieve the latter in a single season.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] He was also named as a semifinalist for the Maxwell Award , and finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting.

[ 25 ] Despite his high school and college jersey number of 7 being unofficially retired by the Redskins in honor of quarterback Joe Theismann , whose career ended with a leg injury in 1985 , Haskins requested and was granted permission from him to wear it. [ 26 ] Haskins signed his four-year rookie contract on May 9, 2019, [ 27 ] worth $14.37 million, including an $8.47 million signing bonus. [ 28 ] Haskins saw his first action with the team in a Week 4 game against the New York Giants in relief of Case Keenum , who was benched for poor performance. In the game, Haskins also struggled, throwing for 107 yards and three interceptions , including a pick-six , as the Redskins lost 24–3.

[ 31 ] Haskins' first win as a starter came during Week 12 against the Detroit Lions , where he finished with 156 passing yards, 28 rushing yards, and an interception in the 19–16 victory. He was criticized for his work ethic when late in the game, he was posing for a selfie with fans so the substitute quarterback was sent in. [ 32 ] For his efforts, he was named the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week . [ 33 ] In Week 16 against the Giants, Haskins threw for 133 yards and two touchdowns before being carted off the field due to an ankle injury suffered on the first play of the third quarter, which also made him miss the following week's game.

[ 39 ] The following week against the Baltimore Ravens , he threw for a career-high 314 yards in another loss. [ 40 ] Haskins was benched in favor of Kyle Allen prior to the Week 5 game against the Los Angeles Rams due to coaches being unimpressed with his work ethic and performance. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] In October 2020, he was fined US$ 4,833 for breaking league COVID-19 protocols after making a reservation for a family friend at the team hotel in New York prior to a game against the Giants. [ 43 ] Haskins remained as the team's backup until the Week 14 game against the San Francisco 49ers , where he played in the second half after Alex Smith left the game due to a calf strain. [ 44 ] He then started the following week's game against the Seattle Seahawks because Smith had yet to recover from his injury. In the game, Haskins threw for 295 yards and one touchdown with two interceptions during a 20–15 loss. [ 45 ] Following the game, Haskins was photographed attending his girlfriend's birthday party without wearing a face mask . Due to breaking COVID-19 protocols again, he was fined $40,000 by the team and lost his status as a captain. [ 46 ] Despite that, he started the Week 16 game against the Carolina Panthers but was benched for Taylor Heinicke in the fourth quarter after throwing 14 of 28 for 154 yards and two interceptions, finishing with a passer rating of 36.9 in a 20–13 loss. [ 47 ] Haskins was released by the team the day after, with head coach Ron Rivera saying he believed that it benefited both parties if they went their separate ways. [ 48 ] Pittsburgh Steelers [ edit ] Haskins signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 21, 2021.

He adopted it as a child due to his having an afro at the time that reminded his mother of a lion's mane . He used the nickname and the film's coming-of-age story as motivation and incorporated it into his personal clothing brand, Kingdom of Pride. [ 56 ] Death [ edit ] Haskins died as a direct result of injuries he sustained at around 7:00 a.m. EDT on April 9, 2022, after he was struck by a dump truck while attempting to cross I-595 near Fort Lauderdale, Florida , on foot.

[ 61 ] Haskins was knocked back several feet by a dump truck and either run over or struck a second time by an SUV that swerved in an attempt to avoid him. [ 62 ] A toxicology report revealed Haskins had a blood alcohol level of .24 and had also tested positive for ketamine , oxymorphone , methamphetamine and norketamine . [ 63 ] A lawsuit filed about the incident claims that Haskins was drugged and robbed by a group that contained one man and three women prior to his death. It accuses the dump truck of speeding, operating carelessly, and violating weight limit regulations, and also claims the rental truck driven by Haskins had a defect that led to it running out of gas.
