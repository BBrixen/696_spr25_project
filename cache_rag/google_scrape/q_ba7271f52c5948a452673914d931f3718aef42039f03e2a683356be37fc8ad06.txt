Members Online • SpiralTap304 An easy, step by step guide to playing Animal Crossing New Horizons online with a modded or banned switch Guide An easy, step by step guide to playing Animal Crossing New Horizons with a modded switch: What you will need: A desktop or laptop running windows (linux and mac are also supported but I don't have those and can't provide support) WinPcap https://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm Lan Play for switch https://www.lan-play.com/download Lan Play GUI https://github.com/takashi1kun/lan-play-GUI/releases 1: Install WinPcap, it's pretty straightforward 2: Download Lan Play for whichever version of windows you have (32 or 64) 3: Download Lan Play GUI and extract it. 4:Get your switch's internet settings ready for Lan Play. The developers have provided a tutorial with images at: https://www.lan-play.com/install . The only thing not provided in that little guide you need to do is set your switch's MTU to 1500. This is needed for Animal Crossing. 5: If you have SXOS, go to the album -> options -> Turn on "Internet Local Wireless Play" If you have atmosphere, download ldn_mitm from https://github.com/spacemeowx2/ldn_mitm/releases Extract this to the root of your SD card. Now the hard part is out of the way, it's time to actually connect to others and play! 6:Open Lan Play Gui in administrator mode. You can do this by right clicking it. You can also tell windows to open it in admin by default by right clicking on it and going to properties - > compatibility. 7: Go to Settings. Under Lan Play Location, find where you saved it and select it. Go to PMTU, click the checkbox and type 500. Click Apply then OK 8:To find people to play with, visit our discord at https://discord.gg/zEMCu5n . I would highly recommend deleting all the default servers on Lan Play GUI and manually adding the ones listed on #public-servers. Ask us in #Animal Crossing which server to use as this could change depending on a number of things. The most popular servers for this game vary but tend to be nut.r3n3.at:11451,frog-skins.com:11451   and bluehouse.servepics.com:11451  . Once you figure out what server to go to, click the green Connect To Server icon. a little black command screen will pop up but you dont need to do anything else on your pc. Now that you have this all set up, you are good to go! You will need to launch Lan Play GUI each time you want to play online. Once Lan Play is connected to your server, go to the Dodo Airport, click "I want to fly" if you want to go to other islands or click "I want visitors" if you want visitors. For either, click local play. If everything is working the way it should, you'll get connected with other players and have a blast. That discord is there if you need help but feel free to comment below also. I will try to help to the best of my ability :) Sorry if this isn't the most well written thing in the world but I wanted to try to help others with modded/banned switches play online too. I will be updating this as needed and most def add some pictures in the future. March 21 Edit: Updated step 6. I've had a half a dozen folks fix issues such as Lan play immediately closing by launching in admin. This seems to fix the problem. Happy to report I have helped a good 30 new folks get online and playing since posting a few days ago :) Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
