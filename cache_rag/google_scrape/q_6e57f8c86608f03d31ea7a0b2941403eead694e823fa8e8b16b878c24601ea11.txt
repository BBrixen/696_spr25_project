The match is scheduled to be played at MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey , near New York City , on July 19, 2026. Background [ edit ] FIFA announced the date of the final on March 16, 2023. [ 1 ] The host of the final, MetLife Stadium, was announced by FIFA on February 4, 2024. [ 2 ] The announcement was originally anticipated for late 2023, but was delayed amid planning difficulties. [ 3 ] Venue [ edit ] The selected host venue for the final is MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey , 10 miles (16 km) west of New York City . [ 4 ] During the tournament, FIFA will refer to the venue as "New York New Jersey Stadium" due to their sponsorship policies. [ 5 ] MetLife Stadium has primarily been used by the New York Giants and New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL) since it opened in 2009. [ 4 ] It has a listed capacity of 82,500 seats and previously hosted Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014 and the Copa América Centenario final in 2016. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] MetLife Stadium will also host the FIFA Club World Cup final in 2025. [ 8 ] The stadium is scheduled host seven other matches during the World Cup. During the tournament, the Meadowlands Rail Line , a shuttle train with no regular service, [ 9 ] and a new, $35 million busway are planned to be used to transport attendees from the nearest transit hub at Secaucus Junction . [ 4 ] [ 10 ] The United 2026 bid—composed of the United States, Mexico, and Canada—was chosen to host the 2026 World Cup by FIFA during the 68th FIFA Congress on June 13, 2018. The bid planned to use 16 host cities spread across the three countries, with all matches from the quarterfinals onward played in the United States. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The venue for the final was not confirmed at the time, with MetLife Stadium named an early frontrunner due to its proximity to New York City and prior experience as host for major sporting events. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Its main competitor was SoFi Stadium , a new stadium in Inglewood, California , near Los Angeles , which was among the ten U.S. stadiums announced in June 2022. The Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California , the Los Angeles area venue that hosted the 1994 men's final and 1999 women's final , was not chosen for the tournament due to its age. [ 16 ] SoFi Stadium was designed primarily for American football with a field that is 69 yards (63 m) wide—narrower than FIFA's recommended dimensions. [ 17 ] According to media reports, the stadium's owner, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment , was also unhappy with the revenue-sharing deal proposed by FIFA and threatened to cancel their plans to host World Cup matches. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] In early 2023, AT&T Stadium in the Dallas area emerged as a potential host for the final due to its higher capacity of 90,000 seats and scheduled renovations to accommodate a wider field. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] In January 2024, MetLife Stadium announced similar plans to widen its field for the World Cup by removing 1,740 seats in the corners. [ 22 ] According to The Athletic , the selection of MetLife Stadium came as a "surprise" to local officials, who organized a small viewing party for the announcement. Dallas's bid had been favored—and rumored as the winner in January—and included a simulcast of the match at two nearby venues to increase ticket revenue. [ 23 ] Entertainment [ edit ] On September 28, 2024, FIFA announced that Global Citizen would co-produce a halftime show for the World Cup final, similar to those in the NFL 's Super Bowl . It will be the first halftime show in the history of the FIFA World Cup. [ 24 ] On March 5, 2025, FIFA announced that Coldplay would help with assisting the final list of performers while also organizing a concert in Times Square during the weekend of the final.
