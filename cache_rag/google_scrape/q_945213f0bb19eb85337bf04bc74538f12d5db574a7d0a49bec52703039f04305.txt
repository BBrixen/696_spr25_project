From 1948 to 1980 , the Winter Olympics also served as the World Championships in Olympic years, with separate competitions held in even-numbered non-Olympic years. During this period, the Olympic medalists received an additional medal of the same metal from the International Ski Federation (FIS). The giant slalom was introduced at the 1950 World Championships and at the Olympics in 1952 ; both programs dropped the combined event, but it returned in 1954 at the World Championships as a "paper" race, using the results of the slalom , giant slalom, and downhill . At the Olympics from 1956 through 1980, World Championship medals were awarded by the FIS in the combined event. It returned as a stand-alone event (one run of downhill, two runs of slalom) at the Olympics in 1988 , which also debuted the one-run super-G . The combined event was run on an FIS points system at the Olympics through 1992 , then was changed to total time of the three runs. The super combined debuted in 2010 , which reduced the slalom portion to one run and the event to one day. Since 1985 , the World Championships have been scheduled every odd-numbered year, independent of the Winter Olympics. At the World Championships, the combined returned as a stand-alone event in 1982 and the super-G debuted in 1987 . The combined event went from points to a total time in 1996 (postponed from 1995), and changed to super combined in 2007 . The event is traditionally dominated by Alpine countries ; as of 2022 [update] , Austria has a commanding lead in total medals with 128 and in gold medals with 40.

Banned from the 1948 games (as was Japan ), they competed as Germany in 1952 , though only represented by West Germany. From 1956 through 1964 , they were known as the United Team of Germany (EUA), which included East Germany, the German Democratic Republic (GDR). From 1968 through 1988 , separate Olympic teams were fielded and West Germany competed as the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). East Germany had only one competitor in alpine skiing ( Eberhard Riedel in 1968 ), who did not win a medal. Following the reunification of 1990, they have competed at the Olympics as Germany, starting in 1992 . Through 2018 , Germany has a total of 40 medals in alpine skiing (17 gold, 13 silver, 10 bronze).
