Members Online • BoomChuckaluck Roadmap for upcoming CDPR games Hello, this is based on my personal research. I'd like this to both provide to & discuss with other gamers & shareholders that may be present here. Feel free to comment. Witcher 4 "Polaris" (2027) First of the next Witcher trilogy – this is the next big one! Start of migration to Unreal Engine 5 Developed by HQ's in Poland Witcher "Sirius" (2028) Will be a spinoff, will introduce MP experiences which probably will lead to a live service product Developed by Molasses Flood Source Witcher 1 Remake "Canis Majoris" (after Polaris, maybe 2029) Developed by Fool's Theory Source (Not sure about the order of the following titles) Witcher 5 "???" (second of the next Witcher trilogy, probably 2030) Not sure which studio will develop these, probably they will use synergies within the global network Both second and third will release in a 6-year-period after release of Polaris Source Cyberpunk 2 "Orion" (development starts end of 2024) Developed by CD Projekt North America Developed by North America & Poland (50/50) Source Witcher 6 "???" (third of the next Witcher trilogy, probably 2033) Not sure which studio will develop these, probably they will use synergies within the global network Both second and third will release in a 6-year-period after release of Polaris Source Project "Hadar" New IP entirely incubated within CDPR Source Read more New to Reddit?
