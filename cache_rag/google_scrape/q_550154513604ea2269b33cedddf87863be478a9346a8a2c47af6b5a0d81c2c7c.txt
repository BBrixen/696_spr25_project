Mandiant received attention in February 2013 when it released a report directly implicating China in cyber espionage . In December 2013, Mandiant was acquired by FireEye for $1 billion, who eventually sold the FireEye product line, name, and its employees to Symphony Technology Group for $1.2 billion in June 2021. In March 2022, Google announced that it would acquire the company for $5.4 billion and integrate it into its Google Cloud division, with the firm becoming fully incorporated in September 2022. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Founding [ edit ] Kevin Mandia, a former United States Air Force officer who serves as the company's chief executive officer , founded Mandiant as Red Cliff Consulting in 2004 before rebranding to its current name in 2006. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] In 2011, Mandiant received funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and One Equity Partners to expand its staff and grow its business-to-business operations, providing incident response and general security consulting along with incident management products to major global organizations, governments, and Fortune 100 companies. [ 6 ] [ additional citation(s) needed ] History [ edit ] Mandiant is the creator of OpenIOC (Open Indicators of Compromise ), an extensible XML schema for the description of technical characteristics that identify threats , security hackers ' methodologies, and evidence of compromise. In 2012, its revenues were over $100 million, up 76% from 2011. [ 7 ] In February 2013, Mandiant released a report documenting evidence of cyber attacks by the People's Liberation Army , [ 8 ] specifically Pudong -based PLA Unit 61398 , [ 9 ] targeting at least 141 organizations in the United States and other English-speaking countries extending as far back as 2006. [ 10 ] In the report, Mandiant referred to the espionage unit as "APT1". [ 11 ] In December 2013, Mandiant was acquired by FireEye for $1 billion. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] In October 2020, the company announced Mandiant Advantage, a subscription-based SaaS platform designed to augment and automate security response teams which combined the threat intelligence gathered by Mandiant and data from cyber incident response engagements; [ 14 ] in December, the company investigated a major supply chain attack through SolarWinds software in U.S. government infrastructure. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] In May 2021, Mandiant was contracted to assist in the response to a ransomware incident impacting Colonial Pipeline , a fuel pipeline operator that supplies close to half of the gasoline, diesel, and other fuels to the East Coast of the U.S. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] In June, the company was spun off FireEye as part of the latter's acquisition by Symphony Technology Group . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] In August, the company acquired Intrigue, which specialized in surface management. [ 22 ] In 2022, Axios reported that Mandiant reporters identified a pro- China disinformation campaign targeting American voters ahead of the 2022 midterm elections . [ 23 ] On May 4, 2023, Mandiant announced its integration for MISP, Splunk SIEM and SOAR. [ 24 ] Acquisition by Google [ edit ] In March 2022, it was announced that the company would be acquired by Google for $5.4 billion and subsequently integrated into the Google Cloud division. [ 2 ] Following the announcement, Fortune reported that while the deal could face antitrust scrutiny, the acquisition "could help increase competition" rather than harm it. [ 25 ] In April 2022, it was reported that the Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division was probing the deal for potential violations of federal antitrust law. [ 26 ] However, Mandiant revealed in July 2022 that the DOJ granted the acquisition approval. [ 27 ] Following a review over potential competition concerns, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) announced it would not oppose the deal. [ 28 ] On September 12, 2022, the deal closed and integration between Mandiant and Google Cloud began. Following the acquisition, Mandiant was allowed to maintain its brand as a subsidiary of Google Cloud. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Flare-On [ edit ] Since 2014, every year around autumn the company organizes a well-known cybersecurity reverse engineering challenge called Flare-On, with participants from around the world.
