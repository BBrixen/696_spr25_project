The staging of the Paralympic Games is automatically included in the bid. [ 1 ] Since the creation of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, which successfully appropriated the name of the Ancient Greek Olympics to create a modern sporting event, interested cities have rivaled for selection as host of the Summer or Winter Olympic Games. 51 different cities have been chosen to host the modern Olympics: three in Eastern Europe , five in East Asia , one in South America , three in Oceania , nine in North America and all the others in Western Europe . No Central American , African , Central Asian , Middle Eastern , South Asian , or Southeast Asian city has ever been chosen to host an Olympics. Due to recent changes at the Olympic Charter, the host city decisions have been made at IOC Sessions between seven and eleven years from the games; for example, the 2020 Summer Olympics were awarded to Tokyo on 7 September 2013, the 2022 Winter Olympics were awarded to Beijing on 31 July 2015, the 2024 Summer Olympics and the 2028 Summer Olympics were awarded to Paris and Los Angeles jointly on 13 September 2017, the 2026 Winter Olympics were awarded to Milan - Cortina d'Ampezzo on 24 June 2019, and the 2032 Summer Olympics were awarded to Brisbane on 21 July 2021. The last host city decision was the 2034 Winter Olympics who were awarded to Salt Lake City on 24 July 2024. IOC – IPC co-operation [ edit ] Even with completely different stories, but with common goals, the approach to the Paralympic Games that began in the late 1980s and progressively evolved into a joint organization made during the 1992 Summer Paralympics , held in Barcelona and Madrid , Spain , the 1994 Winter Paralympics held in Lillehammer , Norway , the 1998 Winter Paralympics held in Nagano , Japan , and the 2000 Summer Paralympic Games were the bridges to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) to sign in June 2001, an agreement that would ensure that the staging of the Paralympic Games is automatically included in the bid for the Olympic Games starting from the bid process for the 2008 Summer Paralympics . [ 1 ] However, the Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee (SLOC) and Athens 2004 Organizing Committee (ATHOC) instead chose to follow the practice of "one bid, one city" for both events. The agreement was adjusted in 2003 and their first extension was signed in June 2006.

edit ] London is the only city to have bid more than once and never lost a bid. Detroit has had the most bids whilst failing to win the rights to host the games once. Los Angeles has had the most bids in the Summer Games. Cortina d'Ampezzo and Lake Placid have had the most bids in the Winter Games. Hungary has had the most bids in the Summer Games that have failed to win the rights to host the games at least once, with six bids—all from Budapest. This also ties it with Turkey for most bids for Olympic Games in general without a successful bid (Turkey has bid for the Summer Games five  times and the Winter Games once). Sweden has had the most bids in the Winter Games that have failed to win the rights to host the games at least once, with nine bids. Beijing is the only city to host both the Summer and Winter Games. Helsinki , Milan , Montreal , Stockholm and Munich have each been selected as hosts for either the Summer or Winter Games while also bidding unsuccessfully for the other Games. Minneapolis has bid for the Summer and Winter Games but has never been selected. Denver is the only city to withdraw its own bid, and the only city awarded Games that were hosted by another city.

Paris was chosen as the site for the II Olympiad, in 1900, despite Pierre de Coubertin 's wish that Paris would celebrate the first Games. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] ^ Originally awarded to Chicago , but moved to St. Louis to coincide with the World's Fair . ^ Rome was the choice of the IOC, but the 1906 eruption of Mount Vesuvius forced the Italians to return the Games to the IOC, which reattributed them to London. [ 4 ] ^ The Games were cancelled because of World War I . ^ Antwerp was awarded with the Olympic Games as a compensation and to honour the Belgians who fought, suffered and died during the war. [ 5 ] ^ Paris got the Games for the second time to fulfill Pierre de Coubertin 's wish to see a successful Olympics in his country, erasing the flaws of the 1900 Olympics, before he retired from the IOC. [ 6 ] ^ a b c Due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War , Japan relinquished its hosting rights to both the Summer and Winter Games. On 1938-07-15, the IOC relocated the Summer Games to Helsinki and the Winter Games to St. Moritz. Finland's invasion by the Soviet Union , in 1939, and World War II forced the IOC to cancel the 1940 Summer Games. [ 7 ] Disagreements with the Swiss officials, concerning the entry of professional skiers in the Games, prompted the IOC to reattribute them for the second consecutive time to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, on 1939-06-09. They were cancelled as well because of the war. [ 8 ] ^ The Games were cancelled because of World War II. ^ a b Selected without election, after the end of World War II. ^ Australia's strict quarantine laws concerning the entry of foreign horses made it impossible for the equestrian events to be held within the Games period. In May, 1954, during the 49th IOC Session in Athens, Stockholm was chosen to stage what would be known as "Equestrian Games of the XVIth Olympiad". [ 9 ] [ 10 ] ^ The games were postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic . [ 11 ] ^ Los Angeles' bid was withdrawn on July 31, 2017 as a prerequisite to being awarded 2028, leaving Paris as the only bidder. The USOC initially picked Boston as the US candidate but later withdrew their bid in favor of Los Angeles. ^ Chamonix was chosen by the IOC to stage the "International Sports Week 1924", which would later be considered the First Olympic Winter Games. [ 13 ] ^ a b c d Until the 1938 revision of the Olympic Charter , the IOC rules stated that the host country of the Summer Olympics took priority if it wished to also host the Winter Olympics the same year. ^ The selection process for the 1976 Winter Olympics consisted of four bids, and saw Denver , United States, selected ahead of Sion , Switzerland; Tampere , Finland; and Vancouver , Canada. The selection was made at the 70th IOC Session in Amsterdam on 12 May 1970. In a statewide referendum on 7 November 1972, Colorado voters rejected funding for the games, and for the only time a city awarded the Games rejected them. Denver officially withdrew on 15 November, and the IOC then offered the games to Whistler , Canada, but they too declined owing to a change of government following elections.  Whistler would go on to be associated with neighbouring Vancouver 's successful bid for the 2010 games . Salt Lake City offered to host the games, but the IOC, still reeling from the Denver rejection, declined and selected Innsbruck to host the 1976 Winter Olympics, which had hosted the 1964 Winter Olympics games twelve years earlier, on 5 February 1973. Salt Lake City would then host the Winter Olympics in 2002 . [ 14 ] References [ edit ] ^ a b c IPC-IOC Co-operation , The official website of the International Paralympic Committee ^ "Athens 1896" .
