ASSASSIN’S CREED VALHALLA The Last Chapter Is Available Now — GameTyrant News Reviews Something Cool TTRPG Tech Retro Virtual Reality ASSASSIN’S CREED VALHALLA The Last Chapter Is Available Now Google Stadia PC News PS4 PS5 Xbox One Xbox Series X|S Assassin's Creed Valhalla Ubisoft about 2 years ago by Hayden Epstein In a surprise drop, Ubisoft has made Assassin’s Creed Valhalla ’s final narrative release available several days early. The conclusion to Eivor’s story was originally supposed to release next week, but due to a “glitch in the Animus,” the content update is available now for all players who own the game. The Last Chapter update is set to finally tie a bow on the two-year journey players have had with Eivor. There are five memory fragments to sequence that will reveal how Eivor’s story finally comes to end, bringing back some familiar faces from across the game’s long history. This is just in time, too, as the next adventure, Assassin’s Creed Mirage is just a few short months away. This update also brings a notable quality of life improvement in the way of the Hood Always On feature. Now you’ll be able to fully embody the spirit of the Assassin while sneaking around England. Players can also redeem a free cosmetic item from the shop each week, and gear items previously locked to the seasonal festivals will be available for purchase from merchants across England. These updates make it clear that Ubisoft is planning to sunset ongoing support for Valhalla in the near future. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla was originally released on November 10th, 2020, making it the longest-supported Assassin’s Creed title to date. Its initial release was warmly met, receiving critical acclaim for the depth of its world and the power of its storytelling. Subsequent expansions were less well-received, with this year’s Dawn of Ragnarök expansion leaving much to be desired . Eivor has become a mascot of sorts for the series over the years, though, and the end of her story is a significant moment for the franchise. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is available for Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Stadia (until January 2023). The Last Chapter update is available for free to all owners of the game.
