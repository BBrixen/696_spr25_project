The five-time Masters champion hasn't been himself for a number of years. Woods has required numerous operations on his back, ankle and Achilles, putting his future in the sport at jeopardy. The decline of Woods is not anything new. He hasn't played in nearly as many PGA Tour events as in the past due to the injuries. At 49 years old, Woods isn't getting any younger, and the days of contending for a top spot may be long behind him. While there have been a number of ailments for Woods, his decline started back in 2021 when he suffered career-threatening leg injuries in a horrific car accident . The Sporting News revisits the crash and his recovery since then.

The golfer suffered serious leg injuries in the accident and¬†had to be extracted from the car using an ax and other tools, Los Angeles County Fire Department chief¬†Daryl Osby told CNN . Woods was first discovered by a neighborhood man who said the golfer was unconscious after the crash. First responders said that Woods was alert when they arrived at the scene of the crash. He was taken to a hospital via ambulance after the accident.

Please see our statement... pic.twitter.com/cSWOxKZC1w ‚Äî LA County Sheriffs (@LASDHQ) February 23, 2021 Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said that Woods was "lucky to be alive" after the accident. The next day, Feb. 24, Woods' team released a statement on X, formerly Twitter, announcing that¬†he suffered multiple fractures to the upper and lower fibula and tibia in his right leg. The injuries had to be stabilized with a rod, and he also needed screws and pins inserted into his foot and ankle. pic.twitter.com/vZitnFV0YA ‚Äî Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) February 24, 2021 On March 5,¬†Woods revealed in a statement that he did not have any memory of the crash or driving that morning, per the Associated Press . Woods told deputies ‚Äî both at the wreckage and later at the hospital ‚Äî that he did not know how the crash occurred and didn‚Äôt remember driving, according to the affidavit. In April, it was revealed by Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva¬†that Woods was traveling 84 to 87 mph in a 45 mph zone, confirming that speeding was the cause of the crash. "The primary causal factor for this traffic collision was driving at a speed unsafe for the road conditions and the inability to negotiate the curve of the roadway," the sheriff said at a news conference.

Explaining new 2024 logo Tiger Woods recovery The accident left Woods' future as a golfer very much in doubt, with an emergency physician saying at the time that it was "unclear" whether he would be able to golf again. "Can he come back from this? It's¬†unclear at this point,"¬†Dr. Robert¬†Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told USA Today .¬†"We don't know. But it's going to be a long rehab period and it's going to be painful. We can assume that he's going to go through bumps and twists and turns. "It's really unclear. But at least he has life right now." Two days after the accident, Woods was transported to¬†Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 18 miles from downtown Los Angeles,¬†for¬†"continuing orthopedic care and recovery," per his doctors. Woods' X account followed up a day later by announcing that he had "received follow-up procedures" that were deemed "successful."

He called recovery from the injuries "painful", even though he was three months removed from the crash. "This has been an entirely different animal," Woods said. "I understand more of the rehab processes because of my past injuries, but this was more painful than¬†anything I have ever experienced." In November 2021, Woods revealed in an interview that he is unlikely to ever return to the PGA Tour full-time. It was a combination of his injuries and his age. "I think something that is realistic is playing the tour one day ‚Äî never full time, ever again ‚Äî but pick and choose, just like Mr. (Ben) Hogan did. Pick and choose a few events a year and you play around that," Woods said . "You practice around that, and you gear yourself up for that. I think that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm going to have to play it from now on. It‚Äôs an unfortunate reality, but it‚Äôs my reality. And I understand it, and I accept it."

It was good for a second-place finish behind only John Daly and John Daly II. The legend of the sport continues to defy what doctors initially said after his crash. He has managed to come back and play in numerous events, though the frequency of his appearances are dwindling. ‚ÄúYeah, mobility, it‚Äôs not where I would like it but ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm very lucky to have this leg; it‚Äôs mine,‚Äù Woods said ahead of the 2023 Masters .¬†‚ÄúYes, it has been altered and there‚Äôs some hardware in there, but it‚Äôs still mine.‚Äù After withdrawing from the 2023 Masters during the third round with a¬†plantar fasciitis injury, he had surgery later that month to¬†address post-traumatic arthritis in his right ankle that stemmed from his car accident . ‚ÄúI hurt every day,‚Äù he said ahead of the 2024 Masters .¬†‚ÄúSome days I just feel really good. Other days, not so much.‚Äù Prime Tiger is in the past. But fans can still appreciate his greatness, especially as he toughs it out moving forward with body working against him.
