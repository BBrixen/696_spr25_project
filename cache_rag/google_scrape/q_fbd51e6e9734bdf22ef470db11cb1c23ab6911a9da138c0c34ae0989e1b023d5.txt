Helping leaders & organizations thrive. Focus: global leadership, transformation, strategy, silo-busting & inclusive cultures. 2y Edited Report this post A new door has just opened in my life. After spending a year helping the amazing LEGO Foundation transform and grow into a fresh strategic direction, time has come to try new opportunities. I will be leaving the Foundation. I am leaving with deep gratitude to my colleagues and partners for everything we have learned, played and built together. Thanks for your passion, courage and trust.   I am leaving sooner than I expected because the Board of Directors and I have not found common ground on the leadership approach needed at this time. I walk through the new door with excitement and determination to help support change where needed at a time where the world is in big trouble. Look forward to seeing you all there. #leadership #gratitude LEGO Foundation CEO steps down 860 130 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Helle Gudmandsen Head of International Education and Youth Engagement  hos Red Barnet 2y Report this comment Dear AB, thank you for all your support to the Alliance for Education in Emergencies.

Especially schools in disadvantaged areas. According to Teach First - 1 in 4 children live in poverty  - Children on free school meals are 18 months behind by GCSE  - Children excluded from school are 4 times more likely to be from a poor background   These children rely on strong school leaders to inspire and develop teachers, improve school environments, support communication, and build trust.   Evidence shows that a strong school leader can UPLIFT GCSE RESULTS BY TWO GRADES 📈   But recruiting and retaining school leaders in such challenging conditions is tough.     Through peer mentoring with business leaders, Inspiration for All makes space for school leaders to put their challenges in perspective, collaborate on problems and grow in confidence 😌   At the same time, business leaders benefit from first-hand insight into leadership challenges in a school environment 💡   And deliver their Learning and Development and Corporate Social Responsibility goals 🤝   I told you it was a genius idea.   So this #SmallCharityWeek , I wanted to give a massive shout-out to Sarah and Paula, who drew on their own leadership experience in business and schools to make this brilliant small charity a reality 🙌  (And big thanks to Kirsty Marrins for introducing us 😊)   It’s a privilege to help them tell their story. #Schools #Leadership #CorporateSocialResponsibility #LeadershipAndDevelopment #SocialMobility #Children #BrandStorytelling #SmallCharities #NonProfit #Charity Inspiration for All - Home inspirationforall.org.uk 20 5 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Taking Shape 23 followers 10mo Report this post While traditional school curriculum is important for learning the foundations of academics, it’s often the life skills and lessons learned through experiences that become the most valuable in a child’s life.

What began as a passion for giving back to society quickly evolved into a leadership role that allowed me to mentor a group of dedicated volunteers. Together, we’ve been working tirelessly to provide education and life skills to underprivileged children, ensuring that every weekend session is impactful and meaningful.  Stepping into Leadership: Taking on a leadership role at U&I meant more than just managing tasks; it was about guiding, mentoring, and inspiring our volunteers to bring their best to each session. One of my greatest joys has been seeing the positive impact we’ve had on the kids we work with, helping them build confidence and providing them with the tools they need to succeed.  Creating a Supportive Community: Building a strong sense of community among our volunteers has been a priority for me. By fostering friendships and encouraging collaboration, we’ve created an environment where everyone feels supported and valued. This camaraderie has ensured that our mission continues seamlessly, even when challenges arise.  Nationwide Leaders Event : Recently, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in U&I’s leads event, where we connected with leaders from across the country. This event was not only a chance to network but also to learn from others who share the same passion for making a difference. The award function was a highlight, recognizing the hard work and dedication of volunteers nationwide. I walked away from the event with new insights and ideas to bring back to our local chapter.  Looking Ahead : As I look to the future, I am excited to continue this journey with U&I. The experiences and lessons I’ve gained have been invaluable, and I am committed to doing even more to help the communities we serve. If you’re interested in making a difference, consider joining us at U&I. Together, we can create a brighter future for these children, one step at a time.

From leadership roles in chapter management to collaborating on philanthropic projects, these experiences hone invaluable skills like teamwork, effective communication, and strategic planning.   Members find themselves stepping up as leaders, organizing events that raise thousands for charity, or spearheading initiatives that impact their communities positively.  I like to think of a sorority chapter as a microcosm of the real world. A controlled, supportive environment where you can try your hand at event planning, budgeting, and communications with an encouraging and empowering structure that uplifts rather than punishes when we fail (Failing is necessary for learning!).    As we continue to integrate these experiences into our lives, it's essential to recognize their value beyond college years.   How have your sorority experiences shaped you? What skills have you carried into your career from those days? Let's share insights and continue supporting one another's growth. 🌟 #SororityLife #Leadership #CareerGrowth #ProfessionalDevelopment 20 7 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in 7,566 followers 465 Posts 12 Articles View Profile Connect More from this author Leadership in Uncertain Times: You don't need all the answers!
