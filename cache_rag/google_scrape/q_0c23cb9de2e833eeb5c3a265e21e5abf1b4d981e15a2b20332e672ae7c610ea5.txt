Reed was even on his round before three straight birdies on holes 8–10. At the par-5 13th, he hit his approach to 14 feet and made the putt for an eagle. Then on the 15th he chipped in from just off the green for another eagle. [ 16 ] Rory McIlroy began the round five shots out of the lead but erased the deficit with a score of 31 on the first nine. He made three birdies in a four-hole stretch then chipped in for eagle at the par-5 8th to get into a share of the lead. Falling as much as five shots behind Reed on the second nine, McIlroy rebounded with birdies on the 15th and 18th to post a bogey-free round of 65 and cut Reed's advantage down to three. [ 17 ] Rickie Fowler and Jon Rahm both shot bogey-free rounds of 65 (−7) and were five and six shots behind, respectively. It was the first time in Masters history three players shot as low as 65 in the same round. The scoring average was 71.26, the lowest third round average since 1986 . [ 18 ] Marc Leishman began the day in the final pairing and two shots out of the lead but failed to make a birdie in a one-over round of 73.

Reed began the day three shots ahead of Rory McIlroy but bogeyed the 1st and failed to make birdie on the par-5 2nd. McIlroy had a four-foot (1.2 m) eagle putt on the same hole that would have tied Reed but missed, settling for birdie to cut the deficit to one. Reed regained his advantage with a birdie on the 3rd hole while McIlroy made bogey. McIlroy made two more bogeys on the first nine, while Reed recovered from a bogey at 7 with a birdie on the 8th to take a four-shot lead to the second nine. Jordan Spieth began the round nine shots behind Reed but mounted a charge to get back into contention. He birdied his first two holes and added three more birdies on the first nine. At the par-3 12th, where in 2016 he made a quadruple-bogey that cost him the title, he made a 27-foot (8 m) putt for birdie from just off the green. He made another birdie on the 13th after narrowly missing an eagle putt, two-putted for birdie on the par-5 15th, then made a 33-footer for birdie on the 16th to get to nine-under for the round and tie Reed. On the 18th, however, Spieth's drive hit a tree and he was unable to save par, settling for a round of 64 (−8). [ 19 ] At the same time, Rickie Fowler was making a challenge to Reed's lead. He began five shots behind and was one-over on his round thru seven, but made six birdies on his last 11 holes. [ 20 ] At the 18th, he holed a 7-footer for birdie to post a round of 67 (−5) and get within one. [ 21 ] Reed, meanwhile, made bogey on the 11th but made a 22-foot (7 m) putt for birdie at the 12th. On the 13th, his approach to the par-5 came up short but hung up in the rough instead of falling into the water, but he was unable to get up-and-down for birdie. [ 22 ] At the 14th, he hit his approach to eight feet and made the birdie putt, and was able to save par from over the green on 15. Reed faced an eighty-foot (24 m) putt on the 17th which hit the cup and rolled five feet away, then saved par. With a one-shot lead heading to the last, Reed faced a 25-foot (7.5 m) downhill putt which he hit to four feet. Reed converted to win by one shot over Fowler and two over Spieth. [ 23 ] Jon Rahm got to within two of the lead before hitting his approach at 15 into the water and making bogey, finishing alone in fourth place. McIlroy settled for a two-over round of 74 and tied for fifth, six shots behind Reed. [ 24 ] Final round scoring average was 70.49, believed to be the lowest single round scoring average in the history of the Masters.
