[ 2 ] Nominations [ edit ] Every year, beginning in November of last year, thousands of letters across the world are sent to the Swedish Academy , endorsing well celebrated and little-known authors for the Nobel Prize. Such nominations can only be done by qualified nominators, namely members of the Swedish Academy and of other academies, institutions and societies which are similar to it in construction and purpose; professors of literature and of linguistics at universities and colleges; previous Nobel Prize laureates in Literature; and chairpersons of writers' organizations qualifying as representative of their countries' production of literature and belles lettres. [ 3 ] Among the fundamental rules in making nominations include not making them public – but some still do as previous years – nor nominating oneself which automatically disqualifies the nominee during deliberations. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Despite the secrecy, many notable writers around the globe are perennially expected to be among the official nominees and favored to win the prestigious literary prize. Among last year's favorite authors to win the prize, according to The Guardian and Literary Hub , include Can Xue , Haruki Murakami , Ludmila Ulitskaya , Ersi Sotiropoulos , Salman Rushdie , Don DeLillo , Thomas Pynchon , László Krasznahorkai , César Aira , Gerald Murnane , Anne Carson and Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The following list features authors considered multiple times for the prize along with the current number of their books the Nobel Library possess. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] The amount of copies helps determine the Swedish Academy 's interest on a particular author.
