At the end of the game's original story, Vinny attempts to kill the thief with a mail bomb, but fails. In a later update, the thief traverses the industrial district's buildings to steal evidence implicating the Lombardis and explosive constituents. He then stashes the evidence in the garage and the explosive charge in the office before setting it off. Vinny is presumably killed as the mansion explodes.
