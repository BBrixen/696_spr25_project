Norway finished with the most medals of any of the 92 countries to compete, with Germany coming in second with 31 medals and Canada taking third with 29. Despite a lackluster start, the United States finished fourth in the medal count with 23 — nine of which were gold. The Netherlands landed in fifth place in the medal count with 20 medals, eight of them golds, after racking up speed skating honors . Norway and Germany sat on top of the leaderboard for the majority of the Games’ two weeks of events, and both earned historic medals and commanded the competition. Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal became the oldest Olympic Alpine skiing champion at age 35 with his downhill win, and Germany dominated the bobsled events, taking home both gold and silver in the four-man event. The International Olympic Committee banned Russia, which earned the most medals in 2014 in Sochi, this year at the Games following an investigation that found widespread, systematic doping. Some athletes from the country were cleared for the Games but competed as the “Olympic Athletes from Russia” and did not wear their country’s flag. Still, “OAR” took home 17 medals. The U.S. had a number of surprising wins and defeats at the Games. The women’s ice hockey team ended a 20-year gold medal drought against arch rival Canada with a thrilling overtime shootout win, and the men’s curling team won its first-ever gold medal. Snowboarders like Chloe Kim, Shaun White, Red Gerard and Jamie Anderson helped the U.S. earn nine golds, and alpine skiers Mikaela Shiffrin and Lindsey Vonn took home a gold and silver, and a bronze, respectively. Still, the U.S. was expecting other medals at the Games, including a repeat for Shiffrin in her signature slalom event (she failed to get on the podium in that one), and an individual medal for figure skater Nathan Chen, who did not earn one despite landing a historic six quads in his program. Chris Mazdzer’s won the Men’s Olympic Luge silver — a first in U.S. history — while the American women’s cross-country sprint free gold on Wednesday was a first for Team USA, and America’s first medal in the Scandinavian-dominated discipline since Bill Koch’s silver in 1976. Here’s how many medals each country won at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Norway, 39 medals Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo of Norway celebrates after the victory during the Mens Individual Sprint Classic Finals on Feb. 13, 2018.
