He has forced one fumble, recovered another, and ranks second on the Hurricanes with three interceptions. Johnson totaled a career-best 12 tackles (seven solo) in Miami’s win at Florida State on Oct. 7, and added an 11-tackle performance in a win at North Carolina (Oct. 28). The Miami native has totaled 15 tackles and two interceptions over the last two games against Virginia Tech (Nov. 4) and Notre Dame (Nov. 11), earning ACC Defensive Back of the Week honors for both performances. The Walter Camp Player of the Year is voted on by the 130 Football Bowl Subdivision head coaches and sports information directors.   A list of five finalists will be released on Wednesday, November 29, and the winner will be announced on Thursday, December 7. The 15-player watch list includes six quarterbacks, five running backs and four defensive players. Fifteen different schools and eight conferences are represented on the list. The 2016 Walter Camp Player of the Year, Louisville junior quarterback Lamar Jackson, is a 2017 semifinalist.  Jackson has totaled 36 touchdowns (21 passing, 15 rushing) and 4,879 yards of total offense for the Cardinals in 2017. Also on the watch list is 2015 Walter Camp First Team All-America quarterback Baker Mayfield (Oklahoma), who has passed for 3,559 yards and 31 touchdowns this season for the fourth-ranked Sooners.  2016 Walter Camp Second Team All-America honoree Minkah Fitzpatrick is a 2017 Player of the Year semifinalist.  Fitzpatrick, a defensive back, has posted 44 tackles and one interception for top-ranked Alabama.
