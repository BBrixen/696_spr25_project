Whether you're a kid or a squid or an octoling; join us!   Subreddit icon by u/Kellie975 Members Online • hamietwalrus Although Splatoon 3 added a lot new features and QoL updates, but it seems overkill to release it on the same system as 2 and should have been released as a launch title on Switch's successor instead Discussion Is this an unpopular opinion? I just feel like Splatoon 2 still has a pretty active community and Nintendo could've just continued to support the game for a few extra years instead of forcing everyone to essentially abandon it and buy a whole new game. They even could've have taken some of 3's quality of life improvements and new features and put them in 2 with paid dlc or something. I just think 3 would've made more since on their next system that will hopefully have a better online infrastructure to make the game easier to play. Read more New to Reddit?
