( edit | history ) WALL-E (promoted with an interpunct as WALL·E ) was released in 2008 and directed by Andrew Stanton . It follows the story of a robot named WALL-E who is designed to clean up a polluted Earth far in the future. He eventually falls in love with another robot named EVE, and follows her into outer space on an adventure. After directing Finding Nemo , Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film set in space. Most of the characters do not have actual human voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds, designed by Ben Burtt , that resemble voices. In addition, it is the first animated feature by Pixar to have segments featuring live-action characters. Walt Disney Pictures released it in the United States and Canada on June 27, 2008. The film grossed $23.1 million on its opening day, and $63 million during its opening weekend in 3,992 theaters, ranking #1 at the box office. This ranks the third highest-grossing opening weekend for a Pixar film as of July 2008. Following Pixar tradition, WALL-E was paired with a short film, Presto , for its theatrical release. WALL-E has achieved highly positive reviews with an approval rating of 96% on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes . It grossed $533 million worldwide, won the 2009 Best Animated Film Golden Globe Award and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature . It was nominated for a total of six Academy Awards , making it the most nominated Pixar film. It was nominated for the 2009 Kids' Choice Awards .
