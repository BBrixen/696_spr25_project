The Walking Dead — Season 11, Episode 17 What to Know Critics Consensus Signs are pointing to The Walking Dead closing out with a shudder instead of a chomp, but Carol and Negan's gristly chemistry gives this installment some distinction.

But much like chapter two’s lukewarm cliffhanger, this episode feels like part three’s engine is idling, not revving up. Rated: 3/5 Oct 3, 2022 Full Review Kirsten Acuna Insider Both episodes end on satisfying cliffhangers - the first of which is resolved right away at the start of episode two - but they're still missing some of the wow factor that usually makes a "TWD" premiere feel special. Rated: B- Nov 21, 2022 Full Review Vanessa Maki The Mary Sue Season 11 hasn’t been my favorite, if I’m being honest. Thankfully the 11C premiere (episode 17, “Lockdown”) gave us some quality Carol and Negan scenes. Separately and together. They play off each other in a way that’s entertaining to watch. Oct 7, 2022 Full Review Rich Cross Starburst There is a sense of looming tragedy, as the series starts to move players into position for The Walking Dead’s last, decisive showdown. Rated: 4/5 Oct 4, 2022 Full Review Dustin Rowles Pajiba The character motivations in this week's episode didn't make a lot of sense; there are a number of plotholes; and even with the urgency of only eight episodes remaining, it still feels like it's spinning its wheels toward an underwhelming finale. Oct 4, 2022 Full Review Erik Kain Forbes The problem with The Walking Dead is that it never built to anything bigger. The structure of the show has been the same for years.
