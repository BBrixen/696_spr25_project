Members Online • [deleted] The Last of Us Part II will be released on 27th September 2019, according to Slovakian store ProGamingShop.sk [Rumor] According to Slovakian store ProGamingShop.sk 's listing of The Last of Us Part II, the game is due for release on 27th September 2019. This could(most chances) be a placeholder and I think it actually is. Link to the Game Page - https://www.progamingshop.sk/the-last-of-us-part-2-p-361690.html Screenshot(However, the cover is just a cheap attempt, kinda for a placeholder. I don't think this would ever be the official box art design) - The website has a Global Alexa Ranking of 134,554, while it has a good reputation in its country with a Slovakian Alexa Ranking of 514. It is also one of the most reputed(from what I've researched so far) video games store in the country. It is also running ads for Days Gone in Google. Screenshot - From Neil Druckmann's recent tweets, we are aware that the MoCap sessions of certain actors(including Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson). But thinking logically, will Sony settle on a release date even before the game's development finishes? So, should we take this as a rumour? Or?
