SIGN UP Mbapp√© was the youngest player in Monaco history Mbapp√© made his professional debut with Monaco in December of 2015, just days before his 17th birthday. That made him the youngest player at the time in club history at 16 years and 347 days old. A few months later, on Feb. 20, Mbapp√© scored his first goal in stoppage time against Troyes. With that score, Mbapp√© surpassed Thierry Henry as the youngest goal-scorer in club history at 17 years and 62 days old. He stayed with Monaco through 2018. Pel√© and Mbapp√© are the only teenagers to score in a World Cup final When you‚Äôre mentioned in the history books with Pel√©, you know you‚Äôre doing something right. Mbapp√© helped France win the 2018 FIFA World Cup, scoring four goals in seven games throughout the tournament. His biggest goal came in the World Cup final, when he scored in the 65th minute to give France a 4-1 lead over Croatia. He was just 19 at the time of the World Cup. Brazilian legend Pel√© is the only other teenager to score in a World Cup final, a feat that he accomplished in 1958. Pel√© won three World Cups in his career, so Mbapp√© still has plenty of work to do to catch him. Mbapp√© is a three-time cover athlete for EA Sports‚Äô ‚ÄòFIFA‚Äô Over the last three years, Mbapp√© has graced the cover of one of the world‚Äôs most famous video games. The French star was on the cover of EA Sports‚Äô FIFA 21, FIFA 22 and FIFA 23. Being the face of FIFA for the last three years proves just how big of a global icon Mbapp√© is. Mbapp√©‚Äôs current teammate Lionel Messi was the last player to be on the cover for at least three straight years, as he held the honor for four straight years (FIFA 13, FIFA 14, FIFA 15, FIFA 16). Both of Mbapp√©‚Äôs parents were involved in sports Mbapp√©‚Äôs mother, Fayza Lamari, was a handball player who competed in Division I in the 1990s. Isn‚Äôt it ironic that her son now stars in a sport that prohibits using hands? His father, Wilfried Mbapp√©, coached at AS Bondy ‚Äì the same club where the younger Mbapp√© got his start in 2004 at the age of 6. The elder Mbapp√© is now his son‚Äôs agent. Mbapp√© is the highest-paid soccer player in the world No player in the world makes more money than Mbapp√©. He recently extended his deal with PSG after rejecting an offer to join Real Madrid. Mbapp√©‚Äôs new contract will pay him a monthly wage of ¬£4 million, or $4.832 million. That translates to just under $58 million per year. He also secured a signing bonus of ¬£100 million, or $120.816 million. The contract runs through 2025.
