The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica Article History Table of Contents Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot The Heisman Memorial Trophy has been awarded annually to the most outstanding U.S. college gridiron football player of the year in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) since 1935. However, the trophy has been given overwhelmingly to players at the running back and quarterback positions. Running backs of various types (that is, halfbacks, tailbacks, fullbacks, etc.) have received the award more than 40 times, including in every year except one between 1950 and 1961 and in consecutive years between 1973 and 1983. Quarterbacks are also very well represented, with players at that position earning the Heisman Trophy nearly 40 times. Throughout the Heisman’s history, only one player has been awarded the trophy twice: running back Archie Griffin in 1974 and 1975. Charles Woodson (1997) and Travis Hunter (2024) are the only two winners who played defense full time. Both were cornerbacks in their Heisman seasons, and both were also wide receivers, though Hunter, unlike Woodson, also played offense full time, amassing nearly the same number of offensive and defensive snaps in 2024. Notre Dame , the Ohio State University , the University of Oklahoma , and the University of Southern California are the only schools in which the Heisman Trophy has been granted seven or more times to players representing their institutions. 1930s to 1950s 1935: Jay Berwanger ( Chicago , halfback) 1936: Larry Kelley ( Yale , end) 1937: Clint Frank (Yale, halfback) 1938: Davey O’Brien ( Texas Christian , quarterback) 1939: Nile Kinnick ( Iowa , halfback) 1940: Tom Harmon ( Michigan , tailback) 1941: Bruce Smith ( Minnesota , halfback) 1942: Frank Sinkwich ( Georgia , tailback) 1943: Angelo Bertelli (Notre Dame, quarterback) 1944: Les Horvath ( Ohio State , halfback) 1945: Doc Blanchard ( Army , fullback) 1946: Glenn Davis (Army, halfback) 1947: Johnny Lujack (Notre Dame, quarterback) 1948: Doak Walker ( Southern Methodist , halfback) 1949: Leon Hart (Notre Dame, end) 1950: Vic Janowicz (Ohio State, halfback) 1951: Dick Kazmaier ( Princeton , halfback) 1952: Billy Vessels (Oklahoma, halfback) 1953: John Lattner (Notre Dame, halfback) 1954: Alan Ameche ( Wisconsin , fullback) 1955: Howard Cassady (Ohio State, halfback) 1956: Paul Hornung (Notre Dame, quarterback) 1957: John Crow ( Texas A&M , halfback) 1958: Pete Dawkins (Army, halfback) 1959: Billy Cannon ( LSU , halfback) 1960s to 1980s 1960: Joe Bellino ( Navy , halfback) 1961: Ernie Davis ( Syracuse , halfback) 1962: Terry Baker ( Oregon State , quarterback) 1963: Roger Staubach (Navy, quarterback) 1964: John Huarte (Notre Dame, quarterback) 1965: Mike Garrett (Southern California, halfback) 1966: Steve Spurrier ( Florida , quarterback) 1967: Gary Beban ( UCLA , quarterback) 1968: O.J.
