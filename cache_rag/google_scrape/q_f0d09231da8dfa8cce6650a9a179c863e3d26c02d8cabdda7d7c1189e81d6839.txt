This image shows his performance at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz . The inaugural Winter Olympics were held in Chamonix , France, from 25 January to 4 February 1924. A total of 258 athletes from 16 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) competed in 16 events across 9 disciplines . [ 1 ] Women also participated in these Games, although the only events they were allowed to compete in were the figure skating ladies' singles and pairs. [ 2 ] When the Games were held, they were not recognized as the Winter Olympics but as a winter sports week festival. It was not until 1926 that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially recognized them as the first Winter Olympics. [ 1 ] 104 athletes won medals for their NOCs, but the athletes from Norway and Finland stood out and dominated the Games, winning 17 and 11 medals, respectively. The United States and Great Britain tied for third place in the total number of medals, with four each. Athletes from 10 of the 16 participating NOCs won at least one medal; eight won at least one gold medal. [ 3 ] Many of the athletes who won these medals had already returned to their home countries by the time the medals were awarded, on 5 February, and other participants from their countries had to take the medals to the winning athletes. [ 1 ] Finnish speed skater Clas Thunberg topped the medal count with five medals: three golds, one silver, and one bronze. One of his competitors, Roald Larsen of Norway, also won five medals, with two silver and three bronze medal-winning performances. [ 3 ] The first gold medalist at these Games—and therefore the first gold medalist in Winter Olympic history—was American speed skater Charles Jewtraw . Only one medal change occurred after the Games: in the ski jump competition, a marking error deprived American athlete Anders Haugen of a bronze medal. Haugen pursued an appeal to the IOC many years after the fact; he was awarded the medal after a 1974 decision in his favor.

The fifth man was an alternate. [ 3 ] ^ D.G. Astley earned a gold medal in curling with the team from Great Britain, but played for Sweden II in their play-off against France for the second silver medal in that competition. The current IOC medal database only lists him as winning a gold medal, though some sources suggest he may have received both a gold and silver medal. If that is true, he would be the only Olympic athlete in history to have received a gold and silver medal in the same event. [ 8 ] ^ Both the official report of the 1924 Winter Olympics and the IOC medal database list two Swedish teams as having won the silver medal in curling. However, neither source explains why two silver medals were awarded in the event.
