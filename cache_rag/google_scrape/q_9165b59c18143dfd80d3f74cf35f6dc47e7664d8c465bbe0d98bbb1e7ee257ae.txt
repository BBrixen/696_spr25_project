Kratos may be back sooner rather than later, and Greek locations and side stories are the whispers being spoken. Fans want to go back to those earlier Greek escapades or dive into new storylines. Either way, Santa Monica Studio has hinted at something significant. No official announcement has cemented facts, but speculation and teases are plentiful. This blog dissects all we know about the new God of War. Greek or Norse mythology lover, there are new developments on the horizon. Let’s see how we arrived and what is to come. Looking Back at 20 Years of Kratos Iconic Beginning & Run The God of War series began in 2005 on the PlayStation 2. Kratos slashed his way through Greek pantheons and put his stamp on gaming history. Subsequent sequels built upon his universe, leading to the 2018 soft reboot that transitioned to Norse worlds. Fans welcomed the change in gameplay and narrative. Nevertheless, many never lost sight of the original Greek bloodshed. With the anniversary, older titles were flying high again. 20th Anniversary Celebration In March 2025, Santa Monica Studio commemorated the two-decade mark of the series. They gave away small treats, such as the Dark Odyssey cosmetics for GoW Ragnarok . Some gamers anticipated some big news. But Sony denied any significant new God of War announcement would materialize at the official event. That left speculators with question marks. What happened to that rumored trilogy remaster or spin-off? Will Greek Return? Side-Story Whispers Reports say a smaller game may surface. This “side-story project” would focus on Greek mythology again, connecting early sagas to contemporary gameplay. Others liken it to Uncharted: The Lost Legacy or Miles Morales in the Spider-Man franchise . Perhaps, it retells something between older God of War games or uncovers hidden aspects of Kratos’ Greek wars. Such a game could be shorter than mainline titles but still deliver punch. Why Greece? Kratos initially comes from Greek mythology. He fought gods such as Zeus, Ares, and Hades. With the 2018 shift to Norse worlds, players were missing traditional enemies, monumental structures, and legendary monsters. The new God of War could bridge that nostalgic void. Getting back to the Greek timeline also avoids overshadowing the concluded Norse storyline. Fans crave more Greek brutality, which the rumored side-story could provide. Remaster Collection The Trilogy Rumors Others anticipated a remastered Greek trilogy or even the entire saga compilation. Ancient leaks suggested a 20th anniversary reveal, particularly because God of War (2005) and God of War 2 lacked modern re-releases on platforms other than PS3. Fans demanded those classics in 4K or 60 FPS. Leakers, however, may have moved too fast. Official word didn’t come through. Nevertheless, speculation regarding a new God of War side title drowned out collection gossip. Why Revisit the Classics? Several players entered the fan community with the reboot of 2018. They never got to see Kratos’ revenge rampage through Greek realms. A refined re-release could bring the whole arc together. It’s the ideal doorway for curious newcomers. That concept is however still pure conjecture. Sony was silent on remasters and concentrating on more immediate expansions and freebies for God of War Ragnarok. Santa Monica Studio’s Next Steps Job Postings and Teasers Recently, Santa Monica Studio job postings indicated another God of War-related project. A quest designer position required a strong background with the series. The announcement suggested fresh material, though not necessarily a sequel or spinoff. Fans speculate whether said side-story or so-called Greek-based game is actually under development. Should it be, we could expect to hear of it before a full sequel. Multiplayer or Single-Player? In 2023, Sony canceled two live-service games, one of which was rumored to be connected to God of War. That leaves the new God of War side project presumably single-player or co-op. Kratos doesn’t often share the spotlight except for cameo allies, so co-op could be challenging. Traditionally, God of War has been a narrative-driven single-player experience. Would Santa Monica try a small online venture? Only time will tell, but single-player is more probable. Impact of God of War Ragnarok Epilogue to the Norse Arc God of War Ragnarok wrapped up Kratos’ Norse saga. Critics and players praised its cinematic style and emotional journeys. The game had some loose ends but generally concluded the saga. If the devs go back to Greek era, they can cover gaps in the story or delve into the unexplored areas. The new God of War could delve deeper into side characters, just like the older PSP games explored Kratos’ tragedies. That direction could appeal to fans looking for new lore. 20th Anniversary Letdowns 20 Years of God of War – A Tribute to Kratos Several expected the 20th anniversary would usher in colossal announcements. Instead, they received the Dark Odyssey pack for God of War Ragnarok. While some were thrilled at free cosmetics, others were left unimpressed. They were hoping for big announcements regarding upcoming expansions or an entirely new game. Santa Monica made no comments. However, where the official sources lagged behind, rumor mills picked up the slack. That brings us to the commotion that’s been speculating about the new God of War side-story. Release Window (Potential) Late 2025 or Early 2026? Insiders predict the new God of War could be released in 2025. If it’s a more condensed side project, dev time could be shorter than for a full sequel. On the other hand, major next-gen expansions could take four years or so. A smaller spin-off can arrive within less than three years. That timeframe coincides with the reported release date. Should it be true, fans can expect an official trailer soon. Will It Land on PS4? By 2025, the PS4 generation will be nine years old. Sony has mostly transitioned to PS5, with the occasional cross-gen release. A new God of War could bypass PS4, making the most of PS5 hardware . And then there’s the enormous PS4 user base that remains enticing. Whether they support older hardware or not is not clear. But the next batch of exclusives generally locks in for PS5 exclusively. Where Can Gameplay Go? Greek Lore Revisited Kratos has battled the entire Greek pantheon, but a side story could develop side myths, minor deities, or flashbacks. Maybe a younger Kratos fought a concealed threat. Perhaps a sidekick, such as Deimos or Orkos, returns in a fresh role. Or perhaps the game is centered on alternate playable heroes in Greek lands. That notion would mirror offshoots such as Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Leaner Scale If it’s a Miles Morales-esque spin-off, gameplay might improve the formula and not reinvent it. Be prepared for a shorter campaign of eight to ten hours. No gigantic world, but new set pieces and sequences. Devs could experiment with combat, introduce a fresh skill tree, or provide exclusive finishing moves. Released from the weight of a giant sequel, they can innovate more. Conclusion The rumored new God of War side-story has people excited. Greek environments could be back. The 20th anniversary event provided small freebies, not big reveals, but job listings indicate something is brewing in Santa Monica’s corridors. Fans of Greek mythology or those seeking another dose of Kratos’ rage have cause to tune in. There’s no official release date or trailer yet, but hints suggest a 2025 release. People who were anticipating an instant remaster or behemoth sequel can hold on a little longer, but something new is coming. Keep an eye out for official confirmation. If the new God of War exists, this year or the next could provide answers. For the moment, we are at the precipice of anticipation, waiting for a potential Greek odyssey like no other. god of war god of war 4 God of war PS5 God of War Ragnarök Previous Article Last of Us Part II Remastered PC – What To Expect Next Article Upcoming Games In April 2025 – Check Dates, Platforms, Price, And More Related Posts Kingdom Come: Deliverance II – Game of the Year Contender March 13, 2025 Monster Hunter Wilds Breaks Records As Capcom’s Fastest-Selling Game Ever March 5, 2025 Leave A Reply Cancel Reply Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.
