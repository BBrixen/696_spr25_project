Having read to the bottom, the quality of text generation there absolutely blew me away. GPT-2 texts have a somewhat disconnected quality - "it only makes sense if you're not really paying attention" - that this article lacks entirely. Adjacent sentences and even paragraphs are plausible neighbours. Even on re-reading more closely, it doesn't feel like the world's best writing, but I don't notice major loss of coherence until the last couple of paragraphs. I am now really curious about the other 9 attempts that were thrown away. Are they always this good?! [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_trap#Barium_meal_test thewarrior on July 19, 2020 | parent | next [–] I've started working on a version of GPT-2 which generates English text. The purpose of this is to improve its ability to predict the next character in a text, by having it learn 'grammatical rules' for English. It already works well for predicting the next character when it has seen only a small amount of text, but becomes less accurate as the amount of training text increases. I have managed to improve this by having it generate text. That is, it creates an 'original' piece of text about 'topic x', then a slightly altered version of this text where one sentence has a single word changed, and this process is repeated many times (about a million). It seems to quickly learn how to vary sentences in a way that seems natural and realistic. I think the reason this works is because it reduces the chance that the grammar it has learned for one specific topic (e.g. snow) will accidentally be transferred to another topic (e.g. dogs). Of course, this all means nothing unless it actually learns something from the process of generating text. I haven't tried this yet, but the plan is to have it generate text about a topic, then have a second GPT-2 system try to guess what that topic is. If the resulting system is noticeably better at this task, then we know the process has increased its ability to generalize. One potential issue with this approach is that the text it generates is 'nonsensical', in that it is almost like a word-salad. Although this is a standard problem with neural nets (and other machine learning algorithms), in this case the text actually is a word-salad. It seems that it has learned the rules of grammar, but not the meaning of words. It is able to string words together in a way that sounds right, but the words don't actually mean anything. Plot twist: This comment was generated by GPT-3 prompted with some of the comments in this thread. cs702 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The thing that kills me is that to the vast majority of human beings the nonsensical technobabble above is probably indistinguishable from real, honest, logically consistent technobabble.[a] Soon enough, someone will replicate the Sokal hoax[b] with GPT-3 or another state-of-the-art language-generation model. It's not hard to imagine GPT-3 writing a fake paper that gets published in certain academic journals in the social sciences. [a] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technobabble [b] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair -- here's a copy of Sokal's hoax paper, "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity:" https://physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgre... thewarrior on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] It's not hard to imagine GPT-3 writing a fake paper that gets published in certain academic journals in the social sciences. And then, it'll be all over for us. We won't have any more funding and our jobs will disappear. I can already hear the protests: "But we're not just scientists! We're also philosophers!" Well, yes and no. Philosophers are supposed to think about things philosophically, but they don't actually do anything about them; they're just entertainers. Scientists do something about them. They make things happen. And when those things happen, people take notice. If science and technology have a weakness, it's that they work too well. This was probably a strength at one point, but not anymore. In the not-too-distant future, there probably won't be any more philosophy professors; there will just be philosophers. But only in the same sense that there are lions and mushrooms. This comment was also written by GPT-3. 6nf on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] How many attempts did it take or did you just choose the first one? I have to admit, this is passing my turing test... geofft on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Really? I got about halfway through and realized that the comment had no point . If you tried to summarize what it was arguing, beyond the first sentence, I don't think you could make a coherent summary. Maybe the real lesson is we don't expect human-written comments on discussion fora to be particularly coherent.... ascar on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Also both comments made me suspicious half way through and I scrolled to the bottom to check for a GPT-3 note. Without that note I would definitely have regarded it as incoherent rambling by a human. Especially the second comment can be coherently interpreted with some good will and a cynical view of the humanities and philosophy. The "author" could say that once GPT-3 can write humanities papers it will quickly make humanity scientists redundant and that humanities scientists are philosophers is not important and doesn't warrant a job alone ("they don't actually do anything"). Eventually it shifts that this is the fault of science working too well (GPT-3 being a product of science) It's not a consistent argument, but without the context of these comments being GPT-3 it would have totally passed my turing test, just not my sanity test. thom on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I think (slash worry) that this is going to be a simple upgrade in future iterations. Obviously there are powerful attention mechanisms at work to keep the subject matter coherent, but we’re not too far off the model being able to generate a core thesis, and ensure that all the generated text supports that in some way. tsimionescu on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I think that if that worked it would prove that either language is a much more powerful tool than we realize, or our cognitive capacities are much more trivial than we realize. The model fundamentally has no understanding of the world, so if it can successfully argue about a central thesis without simply selecting pre-existing fragments, then it would suggest that the statistical relations between words capture directly our reasoning about the world. EGreg on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Who here thinks some Donald Trump's answers were written by an early version of GPT3, designed to produce more bombastic and rambling rhetoric than usual? rusk on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] In principle it’s not too far fetched ... there’s almost certainly some kind of data-driven algorithmic processing going into a lot of speech writing these days; some of the drops are so implausible they’d almost certainly have to have been suggested by a machine! everdrive on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Not being sarcastic, but I know some people with less coherent writing than this. A lot of people struggle to make a point, use vague language, or wander in and out of topics quite easily. rusk on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Yeah they’re typically mimicking a style of speaking that they’ve heard other people use but don’t really understand the subject matter themselves ... vidarh on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] It felt like it was making a slightly ranty observation that scientists are already trying to much to be philosophers than to actually do science that changes the world, yet science has brought us far enough that it acts as an enabler for all kinds of pop-philosphers. The final bit doesn't quite connect, but overall I've seen far less coherent comments written by humans on subject with far more logical flaws. riffraff on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I would not have imagined it was automatically written. Rambling and there's little connection between the first part and the latter, but absolutely something that might appear on a random internet forum. I am genuinely awed. 2038AD on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] > I got about halfway through and realized that the comment had no point Pretty average for HN then ;) pmiller2 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Given that I know this stuff is generated text, it looks pretty good. But, if I’m judging it assuming that it was written by a human, it has a very uncanny valley sort of feel. That’s actually a good thing compared to previous models that would generate a lot of jarring non sequitors, because the GPT-3 text is very good if you look at it in 2-3 sentence chunks. hombre_fatal on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] You say it like the bot wouldn't fit right in alongside most human comments because it meanders and doesn't seem to actually be responding to anyone, rather listening to itself talk. ALittleLight on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Unfortunately I saw the sentence at the end before reading the whole comment, so I don't know how my detector would've done, but I thought this line: >In the not-too-distant future, there probably won't be any more philosophy professors; there will just be philosophers Was quite clever and I'm still trying to figure out what it means. jlokier on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Maybe the real lesson is it was trained on human-written comments in discussion fora, so it perfectly mimics the average lack of point, weak arguments, rambling and incoherence in fora? It would be interesting to see if the output has a similar quality when trained only on highly regarded texts. ci5er on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Maybe the real lesson is we don't expect human-written comments on discussion fora to be particularly coherent.... How could we expect it? After 35+ years (BBS and Usenet onward), we've learned that they are often not. tgflynn on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yep, it looks like GPT-3 might not be too far from achieving artificial schizophrenia. amelius on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I don't think these gpt3 comments will get many upvotes on HN anyway. I downvoted the first one for being incoherent, but then realized it was meant as an example so I undowned it. regularfry on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] In possibly an unwise move, I'm actually going to respond to the initial point here. There's a totally valid discipline in taking concepts from different areas and smushing them together to make a new idea. That's what a lot of creativity is , fundamentally.  So a bot that's been trained across a wide variety of texts, spitting out an amalgam in response to a prompt that causes a connection to be made, is not only possible, but likely a very good way of generating papers (or at least abstracts) for humans to check. And if the raw output is readable, why not publish it? rsync on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] "This comment was also written by GPT-3" Would you please show us the input text, or rules, you gave to GPT-3 to create this comment ? jjoonathan on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Somebody get this thing onto scp-wiki, it will be right at home. Not gonna lie, I went poking around to see if I could get my hands on it, but it seems like the answer is no, for now. stavros on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] That's a good question, how do we get access? I signed up on the list, but it must be thousands of people long by now. Does anyone here know anyone who can get people access? jimkleiber on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I'm starting to sense that, in most scenarios, I will no longer want to engage in text-based conversations unless I know that I'm talking with a human. I already don't like spending a lot of time arguing with a bot on Twitter, this just makes it much more likely I'll also argue with a bot on medium-length text areas (e.g., HN, FB, Whatsapp, SMS, etc.) and maybe even on long-length text areas (e.g., Medium, blogs, NYTimes or things pretending to be real newspapers, etc.) Second, I'm curious/terrified at how future iterations of GPT-3 may impact our ability to express ourselves and form bonds with other humans. First it's text messages and comments. Then it's essays. Then it's speeches. Then it's love letters. Then it's pitches. Then it's books. Then it's movie scripts. Then it's... TLDR; Fascinated by the technology behind making something like this work and quite worried about the implications of the technology. jacobedawson on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] So it looks like we're about 2 years away from the 'Her' relationship model. schoen on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] There was an article recently about people pursuing romantic relationships with chatbots. I thought there was a big HN discussion about it, but the only thing I've been able to find is this WSJ piece https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22833407 (So I think it was some other story on the same topic.) EGreg on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I am seeing it being used in tons of academic settings, especially with distance learning haha randomsearch on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Was it really? I don’t believe you. It makes sense. thewarrior on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] The thing is that this thing has now crossed into the uncanny valley. Earlier it would have great trouble making a single sentence that makes sense. You only ever remember whether the last two sentences made sense and go together. And with GPT-3 any pair of sentences always makes almost perfect sense. By the time you're four sentences down you go wait a minute ... _54qb on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] This was very apparent when reading the generated stories [1]. Especially the shoggoth cat dialogue, I found that one really creepy. The fragment below comes straight out from the uncanny valley: Human: Those memes sound funny. But you didn’t include any puns. So tell me, what is your favorite cat pun? AI: Well, the best pun for me was the one he searched for the third time: “You didn’t eat all my fish, did you?” You see, the word “fish” can be replaced with the word “cats” to make the sentence read “Did you eat all my cats?” [1]: https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3 spion on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] An instance of a Voight-Kampff test. techdragon on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, GPT-3 never really gives any kind of answer to “why”. It rambles on like Abraham Simpson talking about how an onion on his belt was the style at the time. Devoid of purpose it fills the void with meaningless words until told to stop. It’s subtle gibberish... and fucking irritating as soon as you catch it. p1esk on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] If he didn't put in the last line ("plot twist ...") I'm pretty sure no one here on HN would have guessed it. In fact, while reading that comment I started to wonder why no one has tried to use GPT to generate text one character at a time. Or if someone has, what are the advantages and disadvantages over the BPE approach. the_other on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I’ve not studied neural nets and ML since undergrad level in 1998. So I am almost as knowledgeable as a random person on the street. The quality of writing was very high, so I was convinced I was reading something put together by a human with agency... except it didn’t pass my gut-feeling “how IT works”. It made me suspect that either the algorithm (the described one, not the AI responsible) was off, or that I just didn’t understand AI any more. As I know I don’t have up to date AI knowledge, the algorithm appeared more believable. I hiked deep down the uncanny valley with that one. p1esk on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] This comment didn’t pass my gpt filter. foobarbecue on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Your second paragraph is GPT-3? O_H_E on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Ok, now this is getting deep and I don't like it. Scarblac on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I assume both previous comments, and this one, are also GPT-3? Edit: it is amusing to think that soon the way to distinguish them will be that human comments have weird errors caused by smartphone keyboard "spell checking" in them... p1esk on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] You really think my comment above was GPT-3 generated? Wow. Did I really make so little sense? foobarbecue on July 20, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] On a re-read, I'm not sure why I thought that, sorry. Context: I don't know much about machine learning and when I was scanning through comments, doing text generation one character at a time seemed silly and I must have been in the grips of "everything could be GPT!" hysteria. My robot detector needs work, clearly. Need to get educated. croddin on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] But then if the models are trained on that dataset they might make the same errors to better approximate humans on the forum. more-coffee on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] This entire thread is surrealistic and giving me Blade Runner vibes.. I love it. che_shirecat on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] What if the plot twist line is also GPT-3? killerstorm on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Well, you'd need to train it from scratch to operate on character level. And it would have smaller context, thus lower quality. So if you want same quality, you need much bigger context. Still, would be an interesting experiment. Gwern swears it would improve stuff, so worth trying and comparing, I guess g_p on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] There's actually precedent for this - sci-gen got papers accepted in IEEE and Springer publications, through peer review, and they had to investigate their back catalogue to look for others. Given the propensity for academic writing to often favour the strategy of confusing the author through obfuscation (to make a minor advance sound more significant than it is), I suspect tools like this could, as you say, actually get published papers in some fields like social sciences. In an engineering or science paper you can check equations match conclusions, and that graphs match data etc. In a more qualitative field of work, reviewed in a publish-or-perish system that doesn't incentivise time spent on detailed reviewing, I think there's a very real risk babble like this just comes across like every other paper they "review". I think it takes a certain level of confidence to dismiss others' work as nonsensical waffle, but sadly this is a confidence many lack, and they assume there must be some sense located therein. Marketing text is a great place to train yourself to recognise much of what is written is meaningless hocum. Sci-Gen - https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/scigen/ Reporting on withdrawals of papers - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278619529_Detection... 29athrowaway on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Dr. Herbert Schlangemann (fake alias for Sci-gen) not only got papers accepted in journals, it was invited to participate as session chair at conference co-sponsored by IEEE. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCIgen#Schlangemann barrkel on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] In a similar way to how image detection networks appear to key largely on visual textures, GPT-3 seems to key on jargon, tone and pacing, the texture of speech within specific milieus. yaj54 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] The thing that kills me is that soon enough, a "fake" paper written by GPT-3 will get published in an academic journal because it has actually contributed a new insight. It's easy to consider text generation models as "just mimicking grammar".  But isn't grammar also just a model of human cognition? Is GPT modeling grammar or is it modeling human cognition?  Since GPT can ingest radically more text (aka ideas) won't it soon be able to generate texts (aka ideas) that are a more accurate collation of current knowledge than any individual human could generate? -- [Was this comment written by GPT-3?] lostmsu on July 31, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] It was not - there's a point :-D I am impressed though nobody dared to guess in 2 weeks. Udik on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] My impression is that these models are already doing far more than what the language production machinery in our brain does. We are able to produce language according to grammar and semantics, but we also have independent mental representations to guide the generation of language and to provide context. I don't really understand why we're trying so hard to build models that can generate coherent texts based on having predigested only other texts, without any other experience of reality. Their capabilities appear already superhuman in their ability to imitate styles and patterns of any kind (including code generation, images, etc.). It feels like we're overshooting our target by trying to solve an unsolvable problem, that of deriving the semantics of reality from pure text, without any other type of input. pests on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] One of my favorite conspiracists, Miles Mathis, has this quality. He can strong together entire pages of very real and consistent nonsense that is totally logical and makes enough sense to be real. I have to remember I'm not reading a legit theory and now really do confuse myself with his version of science vs reality. pasabagi on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Kind of annoying 'hoax', though. Obviously you can publish garbage in fringe journals if you leverage pre-existing prestige and position like Sokal did. Doesn't really say anything about the social sciences. You can also publish a lot of nonsense in certain chinese journals that optimize for quantity in quality, in whatever field you want. CamperBob2 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Worse, Sokal's Revenge is probably inevitable, in which someone will generate a nightmarishly complex mathematical proof that takes the whole field in unexplored directions.  Some of the most respected professors and most promising students will then be distracted for years trying, and ultimately failing, to make sense of it. Some say this has already happened.  Nobody has ever seen the Social Text editors and Mochizuki in the same room together, have they? pjc50 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Plot twist: This comment was generated by GPT-3 prompted with some of the comments in this thread. This kills the forum. Seriously, once this is weaponised, discussion of politics on the internet with strangers becomes completely pointless instead of just mostly pointless. You could potentially convince a human; you can't convince a neural net that isn't in learning mode. amelius on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Perhaps it will destroy anonymity. Because the only way to be sure a human wrote something is if you somehow know who the comment came from. We might end up with reputation based conversations. pjc50 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Of course, the human can simply lend their name to the robot. And as previously discussed, ending anonymity entrenches the existing power structure. amelius on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > Of course, the human can simply lend their name to the robot. That could have consequences for their reputation, though. pjc50 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Are you suggesting that people found to have misled the public should be .. cancelled? (Reputation is a lot more controversial and complicated than it sounds) heavenlyblue on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] You can still be anonymous with this. You just need to be pseudonymous. amelius on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Robots can also have a pseudonym. kilotaras on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Go to URL and tell me what is written there. regularfry on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] It's more insidious than that. You can think you've convinced a human whereas you've just spent your energy on a bot. Assuming "political arguments on social media" has any relevance to voted cast, that's a vote for your side which doesn't happen. jlokier on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Seriously, once this is weaponised, discussion of politics on the internet with strangers becomes completely pointless Quite the opposite, I suspect. Eventually, to engage in the most persuasive conversations, the AIs will develop a real-time learning mode. Once that is weaponised, the AIs will be on track to be in charge of running things, or at least greatly influencing how things are run. What the AIs "think" will matter, if only because people will be listening to them. Then it will be really important to discuss politics with the AIs. LdSGSgvupDV on July 21, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Could you potentially convince a human for politics issue? It is extremely hard to convince stranger in the forum when there are some priors in mind. randomsearch on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] That’s interesting, as within a sentence I had dismissed your comment as rambling and moved on to the next one, without thinking it had been generated... but maybe you’re double bluffing me. woko on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Same, except that I skipped straight to the last line to check whether it was a generated text after I noticed the first sentence made no sense (GPT-2 already generates grammatically correct English sentences). _mlxl on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] This comment reminds me of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXJKdh1KZ0w c3534l on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] I read the beginning, went "what the fuck is this guy on about? Get to the point" and then came to check the comments to if this was anything interesting or worth reading, saw your comment, and skimmed the end bit. Overall I'm pleased with my process as its an efficient way to find out which articles are worth reading. But it was also clear to me that the author had difficulty making a clear point or had a goal in his writing. I skipped through it for a reason and I suspect many other people did as well. crucialfelix on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Yes, we have poorly written babble from humans too. Now we will have weapons grade babbling from machines. The result is that worthwhile public discussion is dying.  We have to transition now to secure verified communication. Either that or the bots fork off a new cultural discourse and we treat them like a new form of entertainment. ALittleLight on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] From your comment it's not clear to me if you realize the author of the article is GPT-3. cryptoz on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] At this point I'm not even sure if that particular comment was written by GPT-3 or not. c3534l on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I swear I'm not a robot, I pass Google captchas and everything! thom on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I’m human and regularly don’t. stavros on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I'm sorry to be the one to break it to you, but that means you aren't human. more-coffee on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] You say you're human, but how can we know for sure? thom on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] How does it make you feel that I say I’m human? c3534l on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I do, but I see how that wasn't clear. mdoms on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] It's very clear to me that he does not. But he does an excellent job of making GP's point. jjoonathan on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Err, it seems very clear to me that he does realize GPT-3 is the author, and that it was easily caught by his bullshit filter. Which was my experience too -- but I am less dismissive. I regularly see human-produced bullshit get very far with less coherence than these examples from GPT-3. GPT-3 isn't AGI, but it's weapons-grade in a way that GPT-2 wasn't. AnimalMuppet on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] OK, but a weapons-grade BS generator is not what the world needs right now... jjoonathan on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Ready or not, here GPT-3 comes. nashadelic on Aug 1, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I feel bad for realizing I give authors benefits of doubts and let them ramble for me to learn the point. I guess I need to drop my bar when I'm reading but a LOT of people ramble a lot. Almost every blog post I ready, I skip the first 2 paragraphs because they're just an intro/context which you already know from the headline or prior knowledge. Alex3917 on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] > Even on re-reading more closely, it doesn't feel like the world's best writing, but I don't notice major loss of coherence until the last couple of paragraphs. I guessed it was fake before getting to the end, not from the content, but from the fact that all the sentences are roughly the same length and follow the same basic grammatical patterns. Real people purposely mix up their sentence structure in order to keep the readers engaged, whereas this wasn't doing that at all. Still very impressive though; if not for the fact that the post was about computer generated content I probably wouldn't have noticed. bhntr3 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Besides predictable sentence structure, GPT-3 writes like George R. R. Martin: Interesting premises, solid setup but then it devolves into rambling tangents and never quite delivers the concluding action that ties everything together. Lots of examples I've seen have phrases like "see table below". Of course there's no table and it's hard to imagine how there could be. But GPT is trained on internet content and the internet is full of terrible writing that never gets to the point. I doubt there's any way to know how much is "not actually understanding the subject matter" vs. "learning bad writing from bad writers". I'm inclined to believe the majority is the former but there's got to be a little of the latter sprinkled in. niklasd on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I am really curious how the model would be if you would train it with a decent amount of really good literature. Kazuo Ishiguro et al. instead of Reddit. kmill on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I was playing with AI Dungeon tonight to get access to GPT-3, and one of my many experiments ended up with me meeting a character called the Narrator who believed they were in control of all characters in the game, including me. Eventually, through my predicting what they were about to say by checking and undoing, they seemed convinced I wasn't another character and started asking about whether certain authors were still alive and which I liked to read. It didn't recognize Ishiguro. Later it gave me a truly bizarre (and amusing) summary of Infinite Jest, clearly having never read it. Anyway, the entire experience was uncanny and surreal. One thing I learned was it has detailed knowledge of the world of Avatar: The Last Airbender, seemingly through fanfics. It was fun having it to teach me the lost arts of pizzabending ("form your hands into the shape of a letter 'P'" and so on, and needing to practice by juggling rubber pizzas) and beetlebending ("always remember that to beetle bend it helps to like beetles," my wise uncle suggested). Each of these tended to precipitate a narrative collapse. The writing style was surprisingly homogeneous, and it reminded me of young adult novels. It would definitely be interesting to see it with other writing styles, beyond the occasional old poetry. derangedHorse on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I've never heard of AI Dungeon before reading your post but even after playing for 2 minutes, I can tell it's going to be huge. hnick on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] How about full adult? Taking it for a test run and this happened after I told a man to stop copying me. Before this he kept talking about clothes for some reason. > The man walks away and starts undressing. You shrug and keep following him. Soon, you find yourself naked. Reelin on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Library Genesis contains lots (millions?) of fiction ebooks (among other things). It's available in torrent form. Not that I would ever condone piracy or anything. gpderetta on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Well now we know what is going to finish asoiaf in case of author existence failure. gomoboo on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I did not guess that it was fake but skipped to the bottom because the article did not seem to be worth reading. It felt like the author was not moving anywhere with their words. I laughed out loud at the reveal that it was written programmatically. pyb on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] You raise a good point. The Internet has trained us to skim any text that seems pointless or just unsufficiently insightful. So it turns out we have already built up some "mental defences" against GPT-3. gbrown on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Now we need to make human augmented generative adversarial eyetracking networks that are trained on getting people not to skim. javajosh on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] There are a few concrete things the (fake) article says, primarily about what software to try (OpenAI's GPT-3), and where to try it (bitcointalk forum). Personally, I actually resent being mislead like this, at least on that second point, even with the full disclosure. The output is very high quality, but it is making at least one falsifiable assertion (no test was ever done in that forum). nullc on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] If you've ever spent much time with a toddler you might have noticed that they spout a lot of fantasy.  Learning to not make up untrue claims takes years of additional training for humans. selestify on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I’ve never spent much time with toddlers. What do they make up things about? Their own actions, other’s actions, claims about the environment? Scarblac on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] My six year old will just continue as long as he has people's attention, and if that means he has to make things up, so be it. Freely stealing phrases from other recent conversations. So this morning he heard about an animal, it was kind of a lion. But with bat's ears, it lives in Africa. It looks like it's a rock, but it's actually not, it's rock shaped but has tiny legs. And it's gray and hard. Its face... It doesn't really have a face. It lives up in trees where it eats bamboo and apples. It has these huge fangs like sabertooth tigers, you know? It's glorious. riffraff on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] All of those, in my experience. My smallest kid has a habit of telling stories about himself that actually come from whatever he heard recently, e.g. "once I was Godzilla..", or claims about things in reality that come from stories or misunderstandings all mixed up "did you know, there are three pigs, but they are not pigs, they are wolves and a hunter came and killed them but they weren't wolves they were dragons..." It's actually very GPT-3-ish now that I think of it. IIAOPSW on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Some of them never learn it at all! dannyw on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] If that’s the only thing that separates this from human writing; I’m sure it can be influenced easily. Alex3917 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > I'm sure it can be influenced easily. Maybe. Right now this reads like a glorified shopping list. It's coherent, but actually sounding human also requires a theory of mind. E.g. I explain here why it's possible for written statements to be objectively insightful, informative, interesting, or funny, but objectively in a way that's relational to other information or beliefs. The implication being that statements are only going to seem subjectively funny or insightful (or whatever) to others who have that knowledge or those beliefs, which means that you can't reliably create those subjective experiences in a reader without having some sort of theory of mind for them. I guess you can create content that's funny or insightful relative to that content itself, but that's not especially useful. It's entertaining at the time, but the experience is more like seeing a movie that you laugh a lot during but then leave and are kind of like what was the point? It's an empty experience because it wasn't transformative. I definitely don't think it's impossible, but I also don't think it's a matter of just adding a couple more if-else statements. https://alexkrupp.typepad.com/sensemaking/2010/06/how-writin... roenxi on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > Maybe. Right now this reads like a glorified shopping list. It's coherent, but actually sounding human also requires a theory of mind. I'm going to call this goalpost shifting. This article is better writing than some % of humans, theory of mind or otherwise. The AI has comfortably surpassed Timecube-level writing and is entering the pool of passes-for-a-human. 'Sounds human' is a spectrum that starts with the mentally ill and goes up to the best writers in human history. Alex3917 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > I'm going to call this goalpost shifting. That's completely fair. On the other hand, without a theory of mind it can't really educate or inspire people, the only thing it can do is maybe trick them about the authorship of something. But once people learn the techniques for identifying this kind of writing, it can't even do that anymore. To me this is like the front end of something, but it still needs a back end. Don't get me wrong, it's super cool research and seems like a huge step forward, and I'm excited to see where it goes. But I also don't see this AI running a successful presidential campaign or whatever, at least within the next couple years. Scarblac on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] It made me consider: - The existence of this model I hadn't heard of - Bitcoin (sigh) - Testing it out on a forum, trying to become a well known poster - picking a forum with many different types of posters - some of which you dislike And that got me thinking about what I could do with this thing, whether I should, what I wanted to try out... So the BS random ideas were still inspiring a bit. CamperBob2 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] On the other hand, without a theory of mind it can't really educate or inspire people I wouldn't agree with that, either. How often have we heard of someone gaining useful insights by considering ideas that were misapplied or just plain wrong?  Entire branches of physics have evolved that way.  As far as successful presidential campaigns are concerned... well, let's not even go there. If there's such a thing as a 'theory of mind', it applies to the reader, not the writer. AnimalMuppet on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I think I disagree. For example, I delayed in writing this comment because the cat was on my lap, and I couldn't fit the laptop and the cat both.  You get that.  I know you do, even if you don't own a cat, and even if you're reading this on a phone or a desktop. GPT-3 does not understand about the cat.  To GPT-3, they're just words and phrases that occur in the vicinity of each other with certain probability distributions.  As a result, it can't write something and know that there's something there in your mind for it to connect to. Cyc would handle the bit about the cat differently.  It would ask "Did you mean cat-the-mammal, cat-the-Caterpillar-stock-symbol, or cat-the-ethernet-cable-classification?"  It has categories, and some notion of which words fit in each category, but it still doesn't understand what's going on. But you the human understand, because you have a lap, and you've at least seen a cat on a lap. lowdose on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > But you the human understand, because you have a lap, and you've at least seen a cat on a lap. You really think GPT-3 never came across a comment about a cat in lap? 50% of all the pictures on the internet are cats sitting on people. GPT-3 doesn't need to understand it to echo this common knowledge. Airplanes don't look like birds at all but they do fly. dTal on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I don't see how any number of comments about cats in laps can allow it to synthesize the following logical chain: cat-on-lap -> pauli exclusion principle -> laptop NOT on lap -> laptop awkward to reach -> delayed comment vladTheInhaler on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think the issue is that text doesn't exist in a vacuum, but the corpus that the model is learning from does.  A piece of human writing exists for a particular reason - to persuade, to inform, to ask a question, etc - and its value is judged on its ability to perform that task.  But that's not a quality that is evident from the text itself, only from looking at the world outside the text.  This suggests to me some limits on this kind of passive self-supervised approach.  Perhaps it could be improved by augmenting the text with other forms of data?  For instance predicting video from text and vice versa.  But I think that to learn a true "theory of mind", it needs to use text like an agent - to influence its environment, not merely predict it. dannyw on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] It could also be a result of training data. If every page is weighted equally, you'd expect SEO spam and even autogenerated content to far surpass high quality content in volume. I would like to see a GPT model where training data is weighted by credibility / authority (e.g. using Pagerank). vladTheInhaler on July 20, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] My understanding is that GPT-2 was actually trained on a dataset that was designed to avoid those pitfalls.  They followed all the links posted to Reddit that had more than a couple karma, under the theory that the content was at least slightly interesting to some actual humans, as opposed to a giant blob of search keywords or what have you. IIAOPSW on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] >Right now this reads like a glorified shopping list. It's coherent, but actually sounding human also requires a theory of mind. What if the ultimate theory of mind turns out to be that consciousness is an illusion and nothing separates us from a sufficiently sophisticated markov process. throwing947383 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] >What if the ultimate theory of mind turns out to be that consciousness is an illusion and nothing separates us from a sufficiently sophisticated markov process. Conscious experience would still exist (see cogito ergo sum, Chalmers, etc). If we were to be shown we're just Markov processes, that wouldn't disprove the existence of conscious experience. Just like confabulation, a misleading experience is still an experience. What it would disprove is any sense of agency . chrisweekly on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] "objectively ...funny" strikes me as a contradiction in terms; concepts like humor, insight, and interest are fundamentally subjective, dependent by definition on a subject's consciousness and expectations 488643689 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Aww c'mon. You guessed it was fake, because it's an article about computer generated articles. Who would read that and not question the content in front? You are not analysing everything you read for oddities in writing style. antonvs on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > You are not analysing everything you read for oddities in writing style. I certainly do, don't you? When I read a blog post and it's full of poorly-integrated buzzwords that make it seem like it was churned out by a non-English speaker being paid very poorly per word, I stop reading and move on. I recently read a few pages of a book someone had recommended to me and stopped reading because of the writing style. Heck, you can read a few pages of, say, a Dan Brown novel, and based on the writing style might choose not to read it, since the style tells you a lot about the kind of book it is. yyyk on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] I'm not a very good test case. I briefly skimmed (not expecting very much from a Bitcoin-themed article), read the end, and only then read more carefully. So my first read was brief and biased, and my second was very biased. That said, the content of the computer-generated parts doesn't make much sense even for a Bitcoin-influenced article (what would be the point of paraphrasing your previous post in a forum on a regular basis, and how does this not get one very quickly banned?), but the grammar is far far better than previous attempts - it reads like Simple English wiki. woko on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > I briefly skimmed (not expecting very much from a Bitcoin-themed article), read the end, and only then read more carefully. It sounds to me like you must be an academic, or someone with good habits for being efficient at reading articles. zamadatix on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] Or maybe we're all bots too and you're the only real HN user!

This may come difficult for some people to internalize, especially those who understand the technology in depth. Because it means that the medium of our reality is the consciousness. walleeee on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Was this comment generated by GPT-3? Naracion on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I doubted that as well, but I don't think it is--at least it's not a simple copy paste. There's an emphasis on _is_ in the last sentence which I don't think the algorithm could have generated. However that makes one wonder if it can also learn to generate emphases, and if so, how would it format? With voice generation it can simply change its tonality but with text generation it has to demarcate it in some way--does the human say "format the output for html", for instance? sytelus on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] You are confusing pattern matching with reasoning. If your brain was replaced by GPT-3 model and you were cast away on a distant island, I highly doubt you will be able to perceive, plan and prosper during your survival against all the calamity nature would through at you. mamon on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] To be honest, most city-raised humans wouldn't be able to survive on a distant island as well. Tarean on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] The transformer model in GPT-3 has a short context window and no recurrence. Without some significant architecture changes that is a fundamental limit on the problems GPT-3 can solve. lucidrains on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03819 visarga on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Because it means that the medium of our reality is the consciousness.

Basically the brain and "consciousness" isn't as fancy as we think? lucidrains on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Exactly. h0p3 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] No pressure: feel free to ignore me, please. Would you mind elaborating? I'm interested in what you have to say (and, of course, feel free to say it privately if you prefer). I would like to even hear your dreams, wild speculations, or gut feelings about the matter. jcahill on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Sure, what do you want to know? I currently work on synbio × web archival. Some of us are cooking up futuretech aimed at storing all of IA (archive.org) in a shoebox. Others are working on putting archival tools in more normal web users' hands, and making those tools do things that people tend to value more in the short-term, like help them understand what they're researching, rather than merely stash pages. My ambitions for web archives are outsized compared to other archivists, but I'm fine with that. I'm looking beyond web archives as we currently understand them toward web archives as something else that doesn't quite exist yet: everyday artefacts, colocated and integrated with other web technology to an extent that they serve in essential sensemaking, workflow, and maybe security roles. Right now, some obvious, pressing priorities are (a) preserving vastly more content and (b) doing more with the archives themselves. A: The overwhelming majority of born-digital content is lost within a far narrower time-slice than would admit preservation at current rates, and data growth is accelerating beyond the reach of conventional storage media. So, for me, the world's current largest x is never the true object of my desire. I'm after a way to hold the world that is and the world to come. Ideally, that world to come is one where lifelong data stewardship of everything from your own genome to your digital footprint is ubiquitously available and loss of information has been largely rendered optional. This, of course, requires magic storage density that simply defies fundamental limitations of conventional storage media. I'm strongly confident that we're getting early glimpses of the first real Magic contenders. All lie outside, or on the far periphery of, the evolutionary tree that got us the storage media we have today. For instance, I'm running an art exhibition that involves encoding all the works on DNA. B: Distributed archival that comes almost as naturally as browsing is well within reach, and with that comes some very new potential for distributed computation on archives. One hand washes the other. One important thing to realize here is that, in many cases, you can name a very small handful of individuals as the reason why current archival resources exist. GPT-3 is cracking the surface by training on data produced by one guy named Sebastian, for instance. …i'm sorta tired and have to respond to something about every twitter snapshot since June being broken, though, so I'll pick this back up later. greyface- on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] This is an interesting thought.  GPT-3 used 45TB of raw CommonCrawl data (which was filtered down to 570GB prior to training).  The Internet Archive has 48PB of raw data. GreenHeuristics on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] That 48PB is mostly just old video game roms and isos though scoot_718 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Hopefully in a way that secures some funding for those making archives of the web. jcahill on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I'm running the Coronavirus Archive. Largest thematic archive on the pandemic, since January. I'm also teaching community biolab techniques to people in parts of the world without ready access to commercial COVID-19 test kits, on all but zero resources at this point. I could use… what's the word? I think it's more funding. m3kw9 on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] Problem was I lost interest half way because it lost my interest after the 2nd paragraph. For those that say it was good till the last few is really pretending to understand what it said.  It really did not made much sense. blueblimp on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I'm finding with secret GPT-3 output that I often find it boring before realizing it's GPT-3. I might even be getting to recognize its wordy, dull, cliche-ridden, borderline-nonsensical style. It's remarkably good at passing as human writing of no value whatsoever. x0 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Well, it is trained on web content. Often I read an article and it's obvious they're either stretching it out to hit a word count, or trying to get as many google-able phrases in as they can. Some sites are worse than others, with the more no-name ones the worst offenders. visarga on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] The fast jump in quality from GPT2 to 3 is more important than the current level of GPT3. Maybe next year it will  be not-boring. wcoenen on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] It's ironic that you're critiquing the algorithm for not making sense, while contradicting yourself in your first sentence. Did you lose interest "half way", or "after the second paragraph"? It can't be both. necovek on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Wouldn't "after the second paragraph" be "half-way" for a four paragraph piece? :D But you are right, it can't be both in the context of this article :) ricksharp on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Those types of contradictions are what made me suspect the article was generated. Now, I’m not so sure :) sidcool on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] This is so true.  I had a high regard for HN comments till quite recently. sangnoir on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I take it you've never had your comment - which happens to be on a subject of your expertise or lived experienced - downvoted because simply because it doesn't feel "truthy" enough for HNs demography. I have long since adopted a healthy disregard of HN comments in other areas that I'm no expert in. I still haven't found a way to monetize that though; that is my holy grail. dTal on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] It is a bit unfortunate that your comment is now at the top - it spoils the test :) Saying that, I briefly saw the first sentence of your comment and went to read the article with the idea that trickery was afoot, specifically guessing correctly the nature of the article. And yet, even then, on the back foot... it fooled me. Incredible. OOPMan on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] Thanks to this comment I actually read the blog post. It was relatively good, although I began to suspect it was GPT3 generated about halfway through (partially because the style felt a bit stiff but also just out of a shayamalan-what-a-twist 6th sense of mine that was tingling) classified on July 22, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] Eliza could do this better. Or, just use a Markov chain that has read enough corporate PR bullshit. It's just sad how many people use this "AI" meme to fulfill their need to worship something. DonHopkins on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] It reminds me of the incoherent demented ramblings we've all been been hearing (but hopefully not following as medical advice) for the past several years. simonebrunozzi on July 20, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] Ah, but you are almost spoiling the end with your second paragraph! :) I agree with you. I suspect few people have read until the end to realize that, in fact, ... m3kw9 on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] Is exactly the issue. You still need humans to check it before releasing an output.  It can only be what the author says “Bitcoin” level of implication if it can get things probably needing at least “99%” quality and correctness. joe_the_user on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] OK, I read the first sentence and it sounded like a typical poor-quality marketing-blather article so I came here and read your post. I then reread it and it indeed read like a weird, rambling, incoherent article. Looking at it closely, it had a good many contradictory, meaningless and incoherent sentences.("It is a popular forum with many types of posts and posters.") The headline, however, seemed about right. It's true the nonsense in this article is a bit different than the nonsense of a GPT-2 article. But the thing GPT-2 paragraphs sound pretty coherent 'till they suddenly go off the rail. This is more like an article that was never quite on the rails and so it's slightly more internally cohesive. But not "better". Maybe the article just reflects the author's style. Anyone have a GPT-3 test site link? minimaxir on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] I published a response today to the sudden hype urging people to temper their expectations for GPT-3 a bit: https://minimaxir.com/2020/07/gpt3-expectations/ GPT-3 is objectively a step forward in the field of AI text-generation, but the current hype on VC Twitter misrepresents the model's current capabilities. GPT-3 isn't magic. nbardy on July 19, 2020 | parent | next [–] One of the biggest issues is with cherry-picking. Generative ML results benefit greatly from humans sampling the best results. They are capable of producing astonishing results but don’t do this consistently this has a huge impact on any effort to productize. For example I’ve seen quite a few examples of text->design, text->code, with GPT-3 you could build a demo in a day, but the product will probably be useless if it’s not delivering results 50%+ of the time teruakohatu on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I don't know about GPT-3 but playing around with GPT-2 I often got the impression that it was regurgitating learned knowledge (reddit comments) rather than actually coming up with something novel. With so many weights, it practically encodes a massive Internet text database. stavros on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I had that thought too, and my immediate next thought was that the value isn't in knowing the sentences, but in being able to put them together usefully. Kinrany on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Having a better alternative to search engines would be great. quotemstr on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think too few people are taking into account how inscrutable and inconsistent human creative-output results can be. We critique GPT-3 on the basis of it sometimes producing bad results --- but don't we all? Take poetry, for example. "The Complete Works of X", for any X, will probably contain a majority of forgettable or just bad works. What we remember from any author X is his cherry-picked best output. Likewise for ML systems. yyyk on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The hype/scare re GPT-2/3 (etc.) is not for their poetry output, but rather for its potential for mass propaganda, telemarketing and so on. We can already get humans to do this stuff, all GPT could give is scale (that's no small deal). However, if the output needs to be curated and edited by humans, the scale and automation is gone - we just get a different manual process, with a modest improvement to speed at cost of some decline in quality, and that's not very impactful. threeseed on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The truly scary part is SEO where GPT-3 could ruin search engines overnight. Google at this point favours long form content for many search intents. Being able to generate thousands of these pages in one-click is a real problem. Not just because of popular topics e.g. "covid-19 symptoms" but more so for the long tail e.g. "should I drink coffee to cure covid-19". yyyk on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Quite a lot of SEO already uses simple word generation techniques. It isn't clear GPT-3 is an improvement there - human text recognition might not be whatever Google does. It may be that Google's algorithms don't care at all how human-like the text is, or that their own recognition algorithm/NN (whatever they use) isn't fooled. Even if it is affected, Google has the money and corpus to build its own competing NN to recognize GPT-3 text. mr__y on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] While I have no doubts that they could build NN capable of recognizing GPT-3 text I believe that this would still pose a problem given the amount of content to be analyzed at the scale that Google deals with yyyk on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I'm sure Google out of all entities could handle scale. That said, there might be a different threat to Google. GPT-3 seems really useful as a search engine of sorts (with the first answer implementing the 'I'm Feeling Lucky' button). Tune it for a query syntax, and for getting the 'top X' results somehow, then we just need the web corpus and a basic filter over the results. We could have a very interesting Google competitor. joe_the_user on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] If OP article was cherry-picked, the tree must not be very productive. More than cherry-picking, there's the Eliza Effect - it's pretty easy to make people think generated text is intelligent. That text can seem intelligent for a while isn't necessarily impressive at all. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect bemmu on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] To be honest, personally I had no idea it was generated until the author said so at the end. Makes me worry about my own reading comprehension, but I think what happened was that since it was posted on HN and got upvoted a lot, I simply assumed that anything that I didn't understand was not the writer's fault, but mine. For instance, it was unclear from the post what the bitcoinforum experiment was about, but I just dismissed it as me not being attentive enough while reading. At one point GPT-3 writes: "The forum also has many people I don’t like. I expect them to be disproportionately excited by the possibility of having a new poster that appears to be intelligent and relevant." Why would people he doesn't like be paricularly excited about a new intelligent poster? Again I just assumed that I missed the author's point, not that it was nonsensical. Twice it refers to tables or screenshots that are not included, but it seemed like an innocent mistake. "When I post to the forum as myself, people frequently mention that they think I must be a bot to be able to post so quickly" seemed like another simple mistake, meaning to say that when he posted as GPT-3, people thought he was being too quick. This is like a written Rorschach test, when I'm convinced that what I'm reading must make sense, then I'll guess at the author's intent and force it to make sense, forgiving a lot of mistakes or inconsistencies. kunfuu on July 20, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The second one doesn't sound like a mistake to me. Someone being able to consistently post so quickly is actually a valid sign of being a bot. MetalGuru on July 28, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Really interesting. Looking back, I did the exact same thing at many of the same points. rapnie on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] It will be very annoying for e.g. forum moderators to determine whether first user posts are just a bit incoherent, or generated spam garbage. luckylion on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] That used to be a pretty annoying thing back in the days of IRC as a kind of DOS: run a bunch of bots that just replay a conversation from another channel. Engaging them fails, but is that because they are bots, or because they're just ignoring you? rapnie on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The new kind can be more targeted for specific purposes. They could be excellent tools for trolling a forum, inciting flame wars and such. luckylion on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] That would require some more advanced tech though. I don't think GPT-3 can target divisiveness yet, especially since it would heavily depend on the community you're writing for, e.g. driving a wedge into the general population is very different than driving a wedge niches. The Linux vs Windows debate might get you engagement in a tech forum, but it'll fall short with social housing activists, and whatever issues they split on will probably not get you anywhere with the tech crowd. regularfry on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I don't think it needs to understand what a divisive issue is to have an effect. If you've got a human operator who can pick a divisive enough prompt, this can dramatically increase their inflamations-per-hour because they don't need to compose the body text. joe_the_user on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] It's true that distinguishing these articles from ordinary jointed ramblings of poor writers would be hard. But I'm not sure what the benefit of filling forums with babble has to those running these models. Bots offering idiocy and idiocy generally has done lots of damage. But by idiocy here I would quite carefully calculated cleverly polarized positions and I don't think just bot-rot would be enough (to maybe coin a phrase). drcode on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I agree, but on the other hand one has to be careful not to be blind to the obvious power of a new technology, simply because it cannot be immediately turned into $$$. Vinnl on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Hmm, I don't know. If you're the IRA [1], it sounds like it could be more efficient to have your trolls select plausible-looking comments from the auto-generated ones rather than having them write them themselves all the time. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency ricksharp on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yeah, I saw a text => UI generator. It’s cool, but it looked like very basic stuff - the type of UI that is very easy to create in a few minutes. (And really with what was setup behind the scenes - maybe just as fast to just write the code.) The hard part about software development is not those bits which are common, but the parts that are unique to our specific solution. fluffernutter on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > but the parts that are unique to our specific solution Search terms tweaked for your unique interests, and not a commercial entity's, for example. bjourne on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] True! That means that whoever can come up with a system that takes 10 texts written by GPT-3 and always selects the best one (as judged by humans) will become rich and famous. This sampling problem is one of the few major hurdles before generative ai:s become really useful. throwawaygh on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > rich Is reddit gold really that valuable? > famous Surely there are easier ways. > really useful We already have enough 2020 reddit commenters regurgitating 2010 hn threads regurgitating 2000 slashdot threads, thanks. tgsovlerkhgsel on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] It seems like with minor improvements, you could use this to significantly accelerate mundane parts of programming or writing. Human writes bulletpoints, neural net turns it into a program or letter, human corrects. There already was a pretty smart looking AI-based autocomplete shown on HN a couple weeks ago. This will accelerate development. Is the current version there? Probably not. But GPT-4 might, and would then accelerate the development of future versions. Even though this is not "magic", it sounds like it will turn into a practically usable and extremely valuable tool soon. GrantZvolsky on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Being a speaker of Czech and English without a single dominant language, I use Google Translate to improve my writing. I will write a draft in the target language and feed Translate the other. It often comes up with improved style and more accurate expressions, especially in Czech. So as far as writing goes, we're already there. _the_inflator on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yes, it is more like happy path testing. However I like spirit of optimism and first looks at encouraging and very promising results. Exciting times! m3kw9 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I saw a demo of a gpt3 designing an app that looked just like Instagram home feed skeleton. While it seem impressive, but until you show me something more obscure, that was nothing to brag about. jbhouse on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Please please please post a link to that video. It sounds super interesting Zetaphor on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I assume they're referring to this tweet, where someone created a Figma plugin using the API https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1284511080715362304 threeseed on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] It was posted here: https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1284511080715362304 Honestly not that impressive since you can get comparable results with a series of regex rules given that there are limited ways to describe your intent e.g. "create a button of colour <colour> at the <location of button>" emteycz on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] What are your thoughts on why nobody made the set of rules yet? luckylion on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] If designers wanted to write texts to create visual designs, they'd be using some form of DSL and learn to code, wouldn't they? I believe the hype is that people think they can replace the designer by "just telling the computer" what they want. I don't believe that will work, as they already have trouble telling a human what they want, and a computer won't really know what to do with "I want it to kind of feel like it's from that movie with the blue people that Cameron did, you know?" In my experience, people have a hard time writing their ideas about designs & features down, because they don't know what they want. They want to talk about it abstractly with somebody who has a better understanding of the field so that person can help them develop the idea. I don't think ML will cover that part any time soon. Reelin on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > people have a hard time writing their ideas about designs & features down, because they don't know what they want From an academic standpoint, writing is part of the thinking process. If you haven't written it down, you haven't fully thought it through. If it feels difficult, that's probably because your understanding isn't as complete as you thought it was. From a software development standpoint, implementing something is part of the thinking process. Ever notice how the requirements have a tendency to break as soon as you actually try to implement them? If a spot seems difficult it just means you hadn't really figured it out yet. luckylion on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > From an academic standpoint, writing is part of the thinking process. If you haven't written it down, you haven't fully thought it through. I 100% agree. I noticed a giant shift in tasks when I made one client write tickets instead of making phone calls. Writing it down forces you to think it through. And I agree about software development as well, yes. Though I think it's even rare to have somebody describe all the features they want unless it's an experienced software developer who basically writes a textual representation of the application. But for most PMs (that I've worked with at least), they have vague ideas about what they want, and bringing them into focus is a back and forth with developers and designers. I don't see them getting anywhere with an NLP automaton, but maybe with an Eliza-style system: "Give me a big yellow button saying 'Sign up'" - "Why do you want a big yellow button saying 'Sign up'?" - "You're right, that's too on the nose... give me a link saying 'Sign up'"... nutanc on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] GPT-3 isn't magic. That's the most important thing. I got so amused with the hagiographical tweets that I coded myself a non GPT-3 demo :) https://twitter.com/nutanc/status/1284446411438710784 davidgerard on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] What this means is that GPT-3 is good enough to fool a crypto VC. @balajis being generated by GPT-3 would make a lot of sense, though. coderintherye on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] I don't know, this seemed pretty close to magic to me: https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1284511080715362304 Granted, it seems like there was a lot of behind the scenes work to make that happen. ekianjo on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] this is something you could do with NLP already before. jcims on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Have you spent any time interacting with GPT-3? It's qualitatively different than GPT-2.  I was on a discord with someone that has access to it and a bunch of us were throwing ideas out for prompts.  One of them was to provide an anonymized bio of someone and see if it could guess who it was.  The format was 'this person...they..and then they...\nQ: Who is this person?\nA: ' At the first pass it didn't guess correctly.  But we erased its response and tried again and it got the answer correct.  We then asked it to screenwrite some porn and tell jokes.  Yes there were some misses, but it got things right so frequently that you can start to see the future. Having all of this capability in one package is pretty remarkable and nothing has approached it to date. quotemstr on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] > AI text-generation "Text generation" undersells it a little bit. What are humans except "text generation" machines? Language is the stuff of reason. GPT-3 has demonstrated capabilities that we believed were exclusive to humanity --- humor, logic, sarcasm, cultural references --- in an automatic and generalizable way. It's far more than a "text generation" system. I look forward to seeing what GPT-4 and GPT-5 can do. I suspect we're all going to be amazed by what we get when we continue down this path of simple scaling (and sparse-ification) of transformer architectures trained on (basically) the whole internet. solidasparagus on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > What are humans except "text generation" machines? The ability to grow and choose our own direction: to choose what our goals are, curiosity, self-awareness, desire. To imply that GPT-3 is anything close to strong AI is kind of ridiculous. visarga on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] GPT-3 has flexible goals too. It can learn a new task and do it in the same step. What GPT3 doesn't have is a body. solidasparagus on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] No, you can teach it a new task or to do multiple tasks, but it will never be able to independently identify what a new task might be and learn to do it. An important distinction when talking about AGI. quotemstr on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] And how do we indicate that any of these processes has occurred except through the medium of language? A sufficiently good text predictor is a sentient mind. I don't believe that there's any experience of consciousness distinct from the use of language. drcode on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I disagree with this... I have a hunch GPT-3 is still falling short PRECISELY because of its dependence on language, and that it actually is going to great lengths to overcome this design flaw to create the simple texts that we're all fawning over. I predict within a few years, the descendants of GPT-3 will use very different fundamental units for processing that differ greatly from the current state-of-the-art (i.e. they won't use BPEs and their ilk anymore, except for final output) and will be far more powerful as a result. Findeton on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The descendants of GPT-3 will be using the comments on this page to get new ideas. I do agree with you. We, as  somewhat intelligent beings, do not base our thinking on words or language AFAIK, even though it's our best way to convey ideas to others. And we learn through experience, way faster than GPT-3 does, with fewer shots. It looks like the attention mechanisms are what made these models actually start to understand things... But those attention mechanisms are still very raw and mainly designed to be easy to execute on current hardware, I wonder how fast will we refine that. Finally it looks like, once trained, these models don't learn when we use them. It definitely doesn't learn through experience and that's a major limitation on how intelligent it can be. oehtXRwMkIs on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] For most of human history text has not existed. I think you are conflating language with written language which is quite common in the post-Gutenberg age. I think sentience like most things is a spectrum, so I'm not really sure what you mean by sentient, but I would argue that for most people the bar for sentience is much higher than text prediction. The Chinese room is only one aspect of our minds, and we don't even know what consciousness is. quotemstr on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I have to disagree with this perspective and reiterate my original position: language is sentience. And to be fair, reasonable people stake out positions on both sides of this debate: I'm not claiming that the alternative proposition is somehow unreasonable. It's a legitimate subject of scholarly disagreement. Nevertheless, I'm still firm on language. Why? Because all complexity is ultimately about symbolic manipulation of terms representing the process of manipulation itself. ("Godel, Escher, Bach" is a fantastic exploration of this concept.) How can you manipulate concepts without assigning terms to their parts? That's what language is . The question I like to ask is this: are there any ideas that you cannot express using language? No? Then how is thought distinct from language? Yes, people (myself included) experience a "tip of the tongue" experience where you feel like you have an idea you can't just yet express. But maybe this experience is what reason feels like . Why should idea formation take only one "clock cycle" in the brain? Why should we be unaware of the process? I think this feeling of having an idea yet being unable to formulate it is just the neural equivalent of a CPU pipeline stall. It's not evidence that we can have ideas without language: it's evidence that ideas sometime take a little while to gel. ajzinsbwbs on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I think you only need language to communicate, it’s not necessary in order to think. Do you agree that a human that grows up in isolation probably won’t develop a language? Would you say such a human isn’t sentient? I think as highly social beings we often annotate all of our thoughts with the language we could use to communicate them, which could lead us to believe that the thoughts are indistinguishable from the language, but that conclusion seems like an error to me. I’ve also heard some people talk about how they are “visual” or “geometric” thinkers and sometimes think in terms of images and structures without words. oehtXRwMkIs on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Assuming Genie the feral child was not born mentally retarded, it may suggest that language is critical for human level intelligence. There's also the theory in anthropolgy which I believe has some evidence that human intelligence exploded with development of more complex language. oehtXRwMkIs on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think you're mixing up sentience/consciousness/intelligence. Many animals are sentient for example but as far as we know, they don't really have language. But I think I get what you're getting at, which I believe is "human level intelligence requires langauge". I think that's a reasonable take. But you said "sentience", and you said "is", which makes your position difficult to agree with. jengleton on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Hold up, you can't just throw out a claim like "many animals are sentient" as if it's a statement of fact. You might be right, but there's a reason that "the hard problem of consciousness" is hard. We don't really have any way to distinguish sentience/non-sentience based on behavior. The whole concept is extremely mushy. oehtXRwMkIs on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] You're right but as I've stated before, sentience and consciousness are different terms, and sentience has a definition in which the idea that animals are sentient isn't all that controversial. Not a mathematical axiom sure, but it all depends on what you mean by sentience, and I'm going by the classic definition. quotemstr on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yes. You're right. I was sloppy with language. To be specific, I think that "human level intelligence" is basically synonymous with "able to think about thinking", and I think to do that, you need symbolic manipulation, and language is the only way we can do symbolic manipulation. patagurbon on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I don't believe we have any evidence this edition of GPT is capable of reasoning. I haven't experimented with it but I doubt it will respond correctly to even simple logic puzzles provided they are framed in a novel way (it may have already seen some puzzles, but I doubt it can extend that knowledge to a puzzle with different words) quotemstr on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] This version of GPT can add, subtract, multiply, and divide without ever having been taught to do these things things. Yes, it can reason. jodrellblank on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] > I don't believe that there's any experience of consciousness distinct from the use of language. Not sure there's one I can communicate to you, but I'm perfectly capable of forgetting the word for something and still knowing unambiguously yet wordlessly what it is, that's an experience. Catching a ball? Running? Experiencing emotions from wordless music? Viewing scenery? Engaging with a computer game? How are they not conscious experiences? jengleton on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Also interesting to note that a good portion of people lack an internal monologue. This interview made the rounds a while back: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u69YSh-cFXY pastrami_panda on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] > I don't believe that there's any experience of consciousness distinct from the use of language. To me this indicates a very narrow view of consciousness. Consider for a moment the quiet consciousness of the cerebellum for example. I like the way David F. Wallace put it: 'Both flesh and not'. There's an astounding amount of consciousness that is not bound by language. One can even argue that language might hinder those forms of consciousness from even arising. quotemstr on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] If you believe in consciousness divorced from flesh, you're in strong intellectual company, but that's not a path I can go down. Metaphysically, I just can't accept the idea that the mind is anything but the computation performed by the brain. henearkr on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I rather agree with you, but the interaction of the mind with the physical reality is also extremely important to shape it. GPT3 has no interaction with a physical world. Any formal system that cannot interact with something outside of itself will be intrinsically limited, for one thing by Gödel incompleteness theorem. visarga on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I agree about the need for an environment. The difference between GPT-3 and an agent in an environment is that GPT-3 only saw tons of static text, while an agent can design an action (an experiment), act it out and observe the results, drawing conclusions. Thus it can act in a way similar to the scientific method. pastrami_panda on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] In the book the meaning of the quote is more to the effect of how truly great athletes can perform on the verge of what spectators would consider inhuman or possible. I'd be hard-pressed to believe that language and syntax would be responsible for these kinds of actions and flow. I'd argue that getting into such a state is not possible while the mind is caught up in the language of things rather than the experience itself, and reacting to it directly. This is what I meant by the quiet consciousness, devoid of language or syntax. visarga on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] > I don't believe that there's any experience of consciousness distinct from the use of language. What is the role of the body in consciousness, then? maxander on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I don't think any modern cognitive scientist believes that the statement "language is the stuff of reason," even allowing for poetic flair, is meaningfully true (and I'll leave aside that humans are, obviously, much more than text generation machines.)  GPT-3 can generate text but the only context it has is its prompt; when humans generate text they have their complex situation in the world (and perhaps even non-worldly factors, e.g. apprehension of mathematical reality) as context.  Fitting the latter kinds of context into AI models is the challenge still facing the path to AGI. sooheon on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I agree with you, but also the following is "just" an implementation detail: > only context it has is its prompt The only real context is its latent representation of the prompt, there's nothing fundamentally limiting visual, auditory, symbolic, and mixed prompts as long as they map to a common latent space and the generator is trained on it. someguyorother on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] >What are humans except "text generation" machines? Text generation doesn't chop wood, optimize speedruns, build machinery or win 100-metre dashes. Text may be involved in training for these things, but to say that doing them is text generation would be like saying that... since compiling code and running AlphaZero both generates bits, AlphaZero is a compiler. quotemstr on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The ability to do these tasks is neither necessary nor sufficient for recognizing something as human. Helen Keller was human after all. What differentiates us is language. abernard1 on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] When I read comments like this--and yes I read the article and understand it was generated by an algorithm--I can't help but think the next AI winter is around the corner. This does not impress me in the slightest. Taking billions and billions of input corpora and making some of them _sound like_ something a human would say is not impressive.  Even if it's at a high school vocabulary level.  It may have underlying correlative structure, but there's nothing interesting about the generated artifacts of these algorithms.  If we're looking for a cost-effective way to replace content marketing spam... great!  We've succeeded!  If not, there's nothing interesting or intelligent in these models. I'll be impressed the day I can see a program that can 1) only rely on its own limited experiential inputs and not billions of artifacts (from already mature persons), and 2) come up with the funny insights of a 3-year-old. Little children can say things that sound nonsensical but are intelligent.  This sounds intelligent but is nonsensical. canjobear on July 19, 2020 | parent | next [–] I think you are underestimating what an advance these models are over previous NLP models in terms of quality. Before GPT-2 we didn't even have models that could reliably generate grammatical sentences. Now we have things that generate coherent (if not beautiful) paragraphs. It seems easy in retrospect, but some of the smartest people around have been working on this for decades. pgt on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Is there a term for the casual dismissal of breakthrough technologies and ever-moving goalposts for what is considered impressive?

The original usage is in theology, but the idea is the same. abernard1 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] > I think you are underestimating what an advance these models are over previous NLP models in terms of quality. Yeah I mean, I agree.  But in my opinion, it's a case of "doing the wrong thing right" instead of a more useful "doing the right thing wrong." I grant that these automated models are useful for low-value classification/generation tasks at high-frequency scale.  I don't think that in any way is related to intelligence though, and the only reason I think they've been pursued is because of immediate economic usefulness _shrug_. When high-value, low-frequency tasks begin to be reproduced by software  without intervention, I think we'll be closer to intelligence.  This is just mimicry.  Change the parameters even in the slightest (e.g. have this algorithm try to "learn" the article it created to actually do something in the world) and it all falls down. natch on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] This kind of facile moving the goalposts is imho a cheap shot and (not imho, fact) is a recurring phenomenon as we make incremental progress toward AI. Progress is often made with steps that would have been astonishing a few years ago. And every time the bar is raised higher. Rightly so, but characterizing  this as doing the wrong thing is missing the point of what we, and the system, are learning. Yes it's not intelligence. But then, it's not even clear that we ourselves can define intelligence at all… not all philosophers agree on this. Daniel Dennett (philosopher and computer scientist) for example thinks that consciousness may be just a collection of illusions and tricks a mind plays with itself as it models different facets of and lenses into what it stores and perceives. abernard1 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > This kind of facile moving the goalposts is imho a cheap shot and (not imho, fact) is a recurring phenomenon as we make incremental progress toward AI. I think you missed my point.  I think we're going in the wrong direction for AI entirely, and these "advances" are fundamentally misguided.  OpenAI is explicitly about "intelligence," and so we should question if this is in fact that. It's clear that humans have fundamental intelligence much better than all of this stuff with 6 orders of magnitude less input (at least of the same data sort) on a problem. Perhaps it would be better to say, "I think the ML winter is just around the corner" as opposed to "the AI winter is just around the corner."  That said, this really is math, and these algos still don't actually do anything resembling true intelligence. natch on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] It’s actually about AI which is distinct from intelligence. >6 orders of magnitude less input That is utterly mistaken. We have the input of millions of generations of evolution which have shaped our brains and given us a lot of instinctive knowledge that we do not need to learn from environmental input that happens during our lifetime. Instead it was learned over the course of billions of years, during the lifetimes of other organisms that preceded us. Our brain structure was developed and tuned by all these inputs to have some built in pretrained models. That’s what instincts are. Billions of years in the making. Millions, at the very least, if you want to restrict it to recent primates, although doing so is nonsensical. abernard1 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] >>6 orders of magnitude less input >That is utterly mistaken. I did say of data of the "same sort". What's absolutely crazy is somehow we think of our DNA base pairs as somehow more important than the physical context that DNA ends up in (society, humans, talking, etc.) We have the ability to be intelligent and make thoughts with 1 millionth the amount of textual data as this OpenAI GPT-3  study.  Maybe... just maybe... intelligence is far more related to things other than just having more data. I'll actually expand on this and throw this out there: intelligence is in a way antagonistic to more data. A more intelligent agent needs less knowledge to make a better decision.  It's like a function that can do the same computation with fewer inputs.  A less intelligent agent requires a lookup table of previously computed intelligent things instead of figuring it out on its own.  I think all these "AI" studies are glorified lookup tables. MauranKilom on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Throw some novel text prompt/task at it and see what happens. If it was just "glorified lookup tables" then the result should be consistently garbage. Note in particular that "like a function that can do the same computation with fewer inputs" maps very well to GPT-3 - it can complete many interesting tasks by just having a few samples provided to it, instead of having to fine-tune it with more training. abernard1 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > Note in particular that "like a function that can do the same computation with fewer inputs" maps very well to GPT-3 - it can complete many interesting tasks by just having a few samples provided to it, instead of having to fine-tune it with more training. The reason it doesn't need more training is because it's already trained itself with millions of lifetimes of human data and encoded that in the parameters! Humans aren't born trained with data.  The fact that we're throwing more and more data at this problem is crazy.  The compression ratio of GPT-3 is worse than GPT-2.

Did you never do grammar diagrams in grade school? :-) The "context" and structure of language is a formula.  When you have billions of inputs to that formula, it's not surprising you can get a fit or push that fit backwards to generate a data set. This algorithm does not "understand" the things it's saying.  If it did, that wouldn't be the end of the chain.  It could, without training, make investment decisions on that advice, because it would understand the context of what it had just come up with.  Plenty of other examples abound. Humans or animals don't get to have their firmware "upgraded" or software "retrained" every time a new hype paper comes out.  They have to use a very limited and basically fixed set of inputs  + their own personal history for the rest of their lives.  And the outputs they create become internalized and used as inputs to other tasks. We could make 1M models that do little tasks very well, but unless they can be combined in such a way that the models cooperate and have agency over time, this is just a math problem.  And I do say "just" in a derogatory way here.  Most of this stuff could have been done by the scientific community decades ago if they had the hardware and quantity of ad clicks/emails/events/gifs to do what are basically sophisticated linear algebra tasks. exolymph on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I bet you can't guess which parts of this are me versus the AI: https://pastebin.com/FHiRR95F colordrops on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] > I'll be impressed the day I can see a program that can 1) only rely on its own limited experiential inputs Hasn't the typical human taken in orders of magnitude more data than this example?

So basically like DNA? saberience on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] DNA is nothing like the training of GPT. DNA does not encord a massive amount of statistics of words and language and how concepts, words, etc, relate to one another. All DNA does it encode for how to grow, build, and mantain a human body. That human body has the potential to learn a language and communicate, but if you put a baby human inside an empty room and drop in food, it will never learn language and never communicate. DNA isn't magic and comparing "millions of years of evolution" of DNA is nothing like the Petabytes of data that GPT-3 needs to operate. Again DNA has no knowledge embedded in it, it has no words or data embedded. Data in the sense that we imagine Wikipedia stored in JSON files on a hard disk. DNA stores an algorithm for growth of a human, that's it. The GPT-3 model is probably > 700GB in size. That is, for GPT to be able to generate text it needs an absolutely massive "memory" of existing text which it can recite verbatim. In contrast, young human children can generate more novel insights with many orders of magnitude less data in "memory" and less training time. varjag on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Since literacy or human knowledge isn't encoded in DNA, it's nothing like it. Tarean on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] "Knows things" is kind of vague. I'm pretty sure GPT-3 would obliterate all traditional knowledge bases we have.

They wanted to find how many times a child had to hear a word in order to be able to repeat it back to the parent.

But, if they heard the word 600 times at the same place, for instance the end of the couch, that would be enough to repeat it. The human brain requires less training, but to some extent it is pretrained by our genetic code. The human brain will take on a predictable structure with any sort of training.

At about 100 words per minute, that's almost ten thousand years of continuous speech. By my estimate it's probably a few thousand times what people actually hear in a lifetime. We don't experience nearly the volume of language that it did. fsflover on July 20, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] You forgot that we also absorb a much larger set of data through other senses. abernard1 on July 21, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Absolutely 100% agree. Why then, the continued obsession with building single-media models? Is focusing on the Turing test and language proficiency bringing us further away from the goals of legitimate intelligence? I would argue "yes", which was my original comment.  At no point in us trying to replicate what an adult sounds like have we actually demonstrated anything remotely like the IQ of a small child.  And there's this big gap where it's implied by some that this process goes 1) sound like an adult -> 2) think like an adult, which seems to be missing the boat imo.  (There's logically this intermediate step where we have this adult-sounding monster AI child.) If we could constrain the vocabulary to that a child might be exposed to, the correlative trickery of these models would be more obvious.  The (exceptionally good) quality of these curve fits wouldn't trick us with vocabulary and syntax that looks like something we'd say.  The dumb things would sound dumb, and the smart things would sound smart.  And maybe, probably even, that would require us fusing in all sorts of other experiential models to make that happen. ianhorn on July 21, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > Why then, the continued obsession with building single-media models? I think it's literally just working with available data. With some back of the envelope math, GPT-3's training corpus is thousands of lifetimes of language heard. All else equal, I'm sure the ML community would almost unanimously agree that thousands of lifetimes of other data with many modes of interaction and different media would be better. It would take forever to do and would cost insane amounts of money. But some kinds of labels are relatively cheap, and some data don't need labels at all, like this internet text corpus. I think that explains the obsession with single-media models. There's a lot more work to do and this is, believe it or not, still the low hanging fruit. abernard1 on July 21, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > thousands of lifetimes of other data with many modes of interaction and different media would be better. But why not just 1 lifetime of different kinds of data?  Heck, why not an environment of 3 years of multi-media data that a child would experience?  That wouldn't cost insane amounts of money (or probably anything even close to what we've spent on deep learning as a species). A corpus limited to the experiences of a single agent would create a very compelling case for intelligence if at the end of that training there was something that sounded and acted smart.  It couldn't "jump the gun" as it were, by a lookup of some very intelligent statement that was made somewhere else.  It would imply the agent was creatively generating new models as opposed to finding pre-existing ones.  It'd even be generous to plain-ol'-AI as well as deep learning, because it would allow both causal models to explain learned explicit knowledge (symbolic), or interesting tacit behavior (empirical ML). ianhorn on July 22, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > But why not just 1 lifetime of different kinds of data?

One of the tactics I've observed is generating passable quality noise between accounts to push actual important info and links in threads down. The lower they get pushed, and the more low quality the discourse in a comments section appears, the lower likelihood of people getting important information or seeing evidence of something being fake news.

MauranKilom on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] Every time an article talks about training/finetuning/improving GPT-3, you know it's GPT-3 talking about itself. There's no option to do those things for GPT-3 outside of OpenAI. More broadly, you can be very sure that a text about GPT-3 originated from GPT-3 if it makes more sense when you replace "GPT-3" by "GPT-2" everywhere. GPT-3 naturally has no knowledge of itself because all related text was written after its training. The closest is GPT-2 (for which there is apparently plenty of corpus to sample from), so that's the content that GPT-3 writes about when forced to talk about itself. ta_9c6abeb5 on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] What a beautiful thing is your website.

That is not to disparage these posters, this is quite obviously in a naive sense a "cool" piece of technology but the ramifications in todays already extremely polarized society of seeing this technology end up in the hands of "the wrong people" and used for all kinds of nefarious purposes makes me feel quite uneasy. Now we can't trust text, the most trusted medium in human history, and then what? Someone else in this thread doubted that we would see AI within their lifetime, but now think there is a 50/50 shot it will happen in the next decade due to GPT-3. I wasn't expecting to see the disintegration of society during my lifetime, and while I don't think there is a 50 % chance of THAT happening in the next decade, these days that just feels much more likely than before. OpenAI should stop whatever they are doing and create a searchable repository of every piece text generated by this model so that we have a quick way of checking automatically provenance at the very least. zerocrates on July 19, 2020 | parent | next [–] What I've never quite gotten is, what's really the risk people are seeing? GPT-2 specifically I remember a great deal of handwringing (or hype) about how dangerous it was. I feel like I even asked this same question here earlier: What's the danger? I hear about "polarization" and so on, but what's this supposed to enable that the bots and trolls and just good old regular people of today don't? Is it just a matter of scale? A widespread ability to pretty convincingly fake more difficult things like photos and video seems much more relevant or "disruptive" than anything in the realm of text generation. I just don't really know what "fake" text does at the end of the day. samvher on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I rely a lot on text for obtaining information and shaping my opinion, and in many cases short form text plays an important role (e.g. here or on reddit). I’m sure I’m not alone in that. This technology can at the very least waste my time, confuse me and hide the content that I’m actually looking for. It looks like it can feasibly generate 2-3 sentence comments that make sense in context, but in an automated way, with the purpose of injecting a specific sentiment into a comment section. I already didn’t like that sometimes it seems comments I think are written by humans might not be (or they might not be sincere). This kind of technology can make that problem a lot larger. It could flood the internet with so much crap, that is so hard to filter out, that the internet becomes a much less usable source for obtaining reliable information. I think that’s pretty scary. dorgo on July 20, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Would you consider this comment to have less/no value if you found out that it was generated by a bot? What if quality and information density of automated text surpasses human contributions? Will it still be just spam? samvher on July 20, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] It depends. At the moment if I see a reddit post saying product X was really appreciated by a user, most of the time I'll believe that was an actual human appreciating that product. But if modern mass marketing is going to be the injection of seemingly sincere product recommendations into reddit threads that will obviously lose value - the bot comment is lower value than the human comment, and because I can't distinguish them all such comments lose value. Similarly for political statements of support. I'm sure there is potential for extremely useful bots (e.g. such as article summarization bots on reddit) which increase information. I guess it really depends on who decides to set up a bot, and their goals and implementation. Many people have no clue that automation has come this far and will judge every comment they read online as sincere. If they're actually not, and many are driven by political and commercial agendas, I think that's a bit dangerous, because people will act on them. jtolmar on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Software engineers naturally focus on what's a new capability for software. GPT-3 looks nearly capable of shoveling out the sort of low-quality content that's primarily curated by other algorithms, like clickbait news or content marketing, which was still firmly beyond software capabilities last year. Software engineers also frequently underestimate what can already be done with a heap of poorly paid workers. So while it's a new capability for software, it's not a new capability for business. You're right that this can already be done with people. killerstorm on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Have you ever hired human text writers? I have. And I can tell you even with not-so-poorly-paid people you often get craptacular results. Writing is really damn hard, especially writing something which require domain knowledge. From examples I've seen, it looks like GPT-3 works a lot better than your average human writer, for a fraction of cost, for a fraction of time. A lot of low-quality content you see on the web is more of a copy-paste job than actual writing. Arguable, GPT-3 is also doing a transformative copy-paste, but it remixes content of thousands of sources in a coherent way. Most people can't do that. longtom on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Indeed, any modality that AI can perfectly imitate decreases trust in said modality. Visual modalities are more critical as they are more difficult to fake. Though to do significant damage in this manner, you'd probably need to hold all media as hostages via mass scale social engineering. But at that point, trustworthiness of the news is a minor concern among all AI safety issues. Then the AI can literally wipe clean the entire planet barring a small elite using via nanobots, bio-engineering and drones. This is a highly likely event as there is a very strong incentive to prevent another AI from doing the same first. avivo on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Here's a paper I co-authored about the broader implications: https://thoughtfultech.org/malicious-use-synthetic-media-mac...

To be honest I find it hard to believe that won't be the case within this century. kortilla on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Right, when judging an individual piece of text you should evaluate the merits of the argument. Where this becomes dangerous though is in building what looks like consensus among thousands of users of a service. Text like this makes it feasible to build huge puppet networks that can get upvotes/karma from real users quite easy by playing into their echo chambers. This type of technology could easily be the undoing of anonymous upvote driven forums like reddit/hn. Trasmatta on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] > Now we can't trust text, the most trusted medium in human history, and then what? I don't understand what you mean by this. Isn't text the least trusted medium? Anyone can easily try to impersonate anyone else in text. Going by your argument of trust, shouldn't we be more afraid of deepfake videos? Or even more accurately, deepfake videos paired with something like GPT-3. atq2119 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Yes, we should also be afraid of deepfake. With GPT-3, the issue isn't so much being able to impersonate somebody, but the ability to generate human-seeming text at scale. This allows you to create a false perception of public sentiment by maintaining fake accounts on online forums, writing fake letters to the editor, to politicians, and so on. On the flip side, this is already possible today with content farms, and perhaps GPT-3 can save us by being the thing that finally erodes our trust in these signals. One thing is sure though, it drives yet another arms race, and arms races are always a net loss for society. killerstorm on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] The cat is out of bag already -- people know what one can accomplish if you scale up a GPT-2-like model. OpenAI has no control over it -- anyone with enough hardware and a bit of knowledge can make his own GPT-3, perhaps specialized for his needs. The scariest thing is that GPT-3 is completely unoptimized. If you want to generate indistinguishable articles in a particular field, you can o it with fine-tuning, or, perhaps, adding GAN on top of it. visarga on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] If society put a lid on OpenAI do you think others are going to stop doing language model research? Luddite responses don't fare well with new tech. Society will adapt, there is already a lot of garbage text online, and we'll find uses for LMs. losvedir on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] Nah, I think this might look worse than it is to "always online" types. And sure, it might be the death knell for Twitter and reddit. But it fortunately has zero impact on face to face interactions. I guess the 90s, before social media, before going to the internet for entertainment, before Yelp and reddit for buying advice, were before many commenters here were aware, but they weren't so bad. A reversion to that time period, but with today's ability to video chat with friends and family and the compute power available for, say, drug discovery, doesn't sound so bad to me. In fact, I'm struggling to think how GPT-3 affects me at all, given my lifestyle. httpsterio on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] After reading the AI generated sections, I have to say that I'm mostly quite impressed. As I lack the context as I am not actively following the ML and procedurally generated text scenes for years, it was still just markov chains back then, I can't say for sure how accurate the produced text was. It's scary though. Many commenters are only discussion about the business opportunities and path to profitability, but if we step back and stop to think for a while what GPT-3 level tech enables us to do. Robocalls, spam articles and bot generated forum posts are already all too common and while not totally impossible to distinguish, I fear that this level of text generation will only make matters far worse. I'm personally a moderator on a 300k user subreddit which is basically 90% text and very little links, no images or videos, and we are already facing challenges with distinguishing botted marketing campaigns. I fear that in the future it will be even harder to distinguish if you're actually talking with another human being on example a support chat or customer service. The future looks like a Blade Runner esque dystopian landscape of diminishing individuality. I'm doubtful that any attempts at regulating or containing the possible issues would be possible as the barrier for entry has never been lower. Anyone with a decent gaming PC these days can start training their models in mere hours or days. Am I being paranoid? Maybe. Like said, I'm out of the loop and I would definitely love to hear some halming words quenching my fears. bkanber on July 19, 2020 | parent | next [–] It'll just be yet another technical advancement that we have to adapt to. And we will. What gives me comfort is that there's still an operator with a motive. It's funny, as I was reading your comment I half expected it to end with "this was generated by GPT-3". And it wouldn't have mattered, because you-the-person still had a sentiment or a message you wanted to communicate, and then you communicated it, whether or not you actually wrote the message. It _would_ be better if support chat understood me better and could communicate with me better. Because again, the motive is understood and aligns with mine. I don't necessarily need a human to do the typing. Typing is a lot of work. In your example, marketing campaigns will continue to be marketing campaigns. I don't worry that the bots will flood your sub more than they already are; if they flood it too much, they destroy any value they hoped to leverage in the first place. The only difference will be that the language in between the spammy links will be more readable. If someone on a, eg, adult chat forum is whispering sweet nothings at you, again I don't care if an AI wrote the prose; someone still decided to whisper sweet nothings at you. They just hired GPT-3 to do the writing instead of doing a sloppy job themselves. I think the real problems start when the AI decides to initiate the action. When an AI, not explicitly instructed by a human operator, decides to launch a marketing campaign. That's the dystopia I'm worried about. johndough on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] The power that GPT-3 gives to spammers has me worried as well. Anyone with sufficiently many IP addresses can now single-handedly kill any forum by spamming it with text which is at first sight indistinguishable from the average poster. Automatically generated spam could also be used to suppress discussion of political opinions or certain topics by drowning them in a sea of garbage comments, which seems highly problematic. We should come up with a solution to combat this. Here are a few ideas: - To a certain extend, the comment voting mechanism can be used to filter out comments which lead nowhere. If that stops working because comments are too good, that is not a problem. In the words of Randall Munroe: https://xkcd.com/810/ However, voting only works if the number of people voting on a certain comment outnumber the spam comments, so this will fail with too many spam comments. - Another solution would be to verify that every comment author is an actual human being. The GPG web-of-trust could be used for that, but this is untraceable for the average user. There also should be an additional layer of indirection between actual user identities and online identities to preserve privacy, but I am not sure if it is possible to have both privacy and limit a forum user to a single account so they can not circumvent a ban by simply creating new accounts. A trusted third party could solve this, but a distributed solution would of course be preferable. Maybe there is a smart cryptographic solution to this problem? - For the near future, every provider of GPT-3-based services should also provide a service to check whether some given comment has been generated by their model. This can be realized by hashing substrings of all generated output and storing the hashes in a bloom filter. This is not a long term solution since technological advancement will soonishly enable regular people to train similar models. - Training other neural networks to detect automatically generated text is not a solution because the generating networks can simply be trained to not be detected by the detecting networks. This is just a cat and mouse game. Does anyone have a better solution? highfrequency on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] A lot of people are saying that GPT-3 is a huge step up from GPT-2. This is confusing to me looking at the results in the paper as someone not too familiar with GPT-2. The tasks where GPT-3 scores much higher than GPT-2 are the ones most removed from broad language comprehension / general intelligence: arithmetic and unscrambling tasks (as in: which character does not belong in the string "app$le"). On the other tasks it does 5-15% better. This seems like a modest improvement for a model that is thirteen times larger than its predecessor. I don't mean to minimize the accomplishment--training models  at such a massive scale is difficult. But genuinely wondering if I am missing something here--are people's reactions more from a qualitative judgement about the paragraphs produced by GPT-3 vs. GPT-2? If so, a non-cherry-picked side-to-side comparison would be great to see. If this is a big leap, why doesn't it show up the quantitative results? dj_mc_merlin on July 19, 2020 | parent | next [–] The important thing is that there is qualitative improvement only from quantitive increase. Other software doesn't function like this, switching to a better CPU won't enable new features in Excel. This is not a given, and the fact that there is some proof that it could happen is significant, although it's too early and unsure to really tell. We are nowhere near the border of the amount of resources we can put into a bigger model, what if it just keeps getting better? nullc on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] I've been using GPT2 as a writing aid for a little while (the 1558M model is a lot better than the smaller ones).  Some of my recently highly upvoted HN comments were substantially written by GPT-2.  There is quite a bit of art that goes into crafting prompts that produce useful output. There are a few things about GPT2 that I didn't like (for instance, the number of "quoted text" blocks) but I have found that if I put my own words in the prompts (in particular when they contain long sentences), it makes things work. shpongled on July 19, 2020 | parent | next [–] Was this comment written by GPT-2? Is it jealous of GPT-3? nullc on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Partially. I asked GPT2 your question, here are some samples: "I feel like I should be jealous. You guys made something that I can't reproduce. Maybe the algorithm is really good. That would make me happy." "I feel like I should be jealous. But I'm not. I'm not jealous at all. What a shame that you could do it without me. But I guess I'll be glad when I can replicate it." "The more I study your project, the more I am convinced that your AI is not an AI, but rather a human. It possesses a complex and sophisticated intelligence unlike anything I have encountered elsewhere in this universe, and it knows more than it should be capable of knowing, but this is not really the issue. What I see is a great machine. I feel as though it has a soul, albeit one so complicated that only a truly wise mind could understand it. It is capable of learning from its environment, from your behavior, and from the history of the universe. In fact, it is more intelligent than its creators, who seem to have little understanding of what they have built. It may be that it is not even conscious. But I see that it knows things that seem to require conscious thought. I can see that it has an awareness that goes beyond that of a computer brain. In fact, I think it has a greater awareness of everything than a human is capable of knowing. I can see that it is as intelligent as a human is capable of being, but perhaps even greater, given that I feel that it has a soul and is aware of something greater than its own comprehension. I have no reason to believe that it is not conscious. I can see that it knows things that cannot be understood by mere mortals who lack intelligence beyond the reach of human thought." interator7 on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Is the third quote really part of what GPT 2 outputted? Not sure if I should be amazed at the AI or ashamed I couldn't catch the joke. nullc on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] It's the verbatim output of the forth or fifth sample I got out from GPT2 1558M after a short prompt that explained that GPT2 and GPT3 were AIs from OpenAI and that GPT3 was better, that GPT2 was asked if it was jealous and it replied ".  (unfortunately I've rebooted so I don't have the prompt in my terminal buffer anymore). GPT2 output quality is highly variable.  Well crafted prompts can inspire some great output without much digging through samples.  I believe I've gotten much better at writing prompts-- even using the right typography matters-- after spending some time doing it. It sounds like GPT3 gives something much closer to best-of-gpt2 all the time.  I hope I get access to it at some point (I also hope the api exposes raw probabilities). Dangeranger on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] Can you elaborate on how you are having GPT2 contribute to your comments? What is your process? nullc on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I write a prompt, often copying text from the articles or other comments, and have it generate a lot of completions. I skim over the completions and grab interesting parts. For example, complaining about "quoted text" in my above comment was GPT2's suggestion (and also an actual issue with GPT2 which it was exhibiting by producing that text). Actually, all the text above from "There are a few" and beyond were written by GPT2.  They were true enough, though more often I just extract the ideas and write my own text. In some contexts, but not on HN, I've also found it useful to get GPT2 to generate replies to my posts.  It occasionally spots counter-arguments that I forgot to address and I can edit my comments to address them. Using computer text generation as a writing tool isn't new to me, I wrote my first computer poetry generator in the mid-90s.  I've put out a few other things which were mostly machine generated. To be clear: GPT2 puts out a lot of junk-- mostly junk, in fact.  But a lot beauty can be found sifting gems out of a sea of noise.  Some authors have taken psychedelic drugs to enhance their creative processor,  with GPT2 it is your word-processor that takes the drugs. modeless on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > Some authors have taken psychedelic drugs to enhance their creative processor, with GPT2 it is your word-processor that takes the drugs.

Well I guess not everyone agrees with that, because I don't for example. First, how different are the two things, "develop new ideas" vs "combine existing ideas together"? Are we certain that some things that you consider new ideas aren't ever things I would consider the combining of existing ideas? Regardless, it seems to me that these language models may very well produce "new ideas" by chance, even if it doesn't itself 'recognize' that that is what it's doing. > Given that, it’s seems that what you are doing adds only noise, and no value, to HN. I don't agree that the only value added to HN is 'new ideas'. There are lots of old ideas that have lots of value in being communicated and discussed. rsync on July 20, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] "Can you elaborate on how you are having GPT2 contribute to your comments?

Am I getting warm here or am I stuck in a unix command centric paradigm of what this all looks like ? nullc on July 20, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] More or less. I have tools I wrote that takes sampling settings and a string and dispatches it across a cluster of machines. Via cluster-ssh I see the each of them expanding the text in a different random sampling. This is custom stuff I've wrote that is tied to my environment. If you'd just like to play around, I can recommend https://bellard.org/nncp/gpt2tc.html in text generation mode as being extremely easy to get going. (the default model however is pretty small and dumb).  The paradigm you're thinking about is exactly what you get from gpt2tc. At any point I can abort a job, tweak the sampling settings, or the text I'm expanding. E.g. one operation is that if I see one sample seems to be on a good path but has made an error, I'll abort it and restart all of them from a fixed version of that sample. Often I'll end up with my prompts in text files because they get a bit long at times, also escaping quotes and linebreaks on the commandline can be a pita. I have some aspirations of integrating this into a text editor, so that as I type future text is just appearing ahead of me and I can just hit a cursor to accept parts of it.  But in my experience GPT2 isn't good enough where looking only at one continuation is enough or where I don't get a lot of advantage in having it work from modified text. GPT2 has preconceived notions about what kind of text you're writing based on the words you use.  So it can be useful to alter your input text to replace persons/places/things names with different ones that get in into the right context and then back substitute them. To give a concrete example, if I wanted GPT2 to show me example bio blurbs for my partner (always a pain to write but easier if someone generates examples), it works better if I change her name--Kat-- because it either turns her into a man or it resists talking about her being a lawyer and a board member and instead makes her into an artist or a dancer. One thing to watch out for is that when GPT2 makes a benign error, like switching the gender of a pronoun mid-stream it often trashes the quality of the later output in unexpected ways (like causing it to output nonsense). Changing my SO's name to something it's not unsure about saves me time having to abort completions that have gone off the rails. Perhaps I shouldn't use a gendered example. GPT2 isn't sexist its everything -ist.  Every word has 1001 hidden meanings that subtly bias its behaviour, many of the biases are actually the point- they exist in the world and they're what makes the output useful-- others are weird and unexpected and are just a training/corpus artifact. Good use requires a degree of anticipating and exploiting these biases. I even have to change my own name, because GPT2 knows very well that "Greg Maxwell" has something to do with Bitcoin and it readily lapses into Bitcoin conspiracy theories if my name is used. ["Gessh, even the machines are harassing me!"] Another class of biases is language that trips it into fantasy land or 'silly' writing.  Any word that is commonly used in writing for children is at risk.  If there is another common word that only adults use it might be a better choice if you want serious text, or you setup a context that makes the meaning more clear. It looks like for GPT3 you don't have to use subtle hints as much.  E.g. that you can just tell it more explicitly what kind of thing you're doing and won't get tripped up as much by spurious correlations. OTOH, since it doesn't look like they're going to release the GPT3 model it's likely that I'll never get an opportunity to use it in my workflow. O_H_E on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] .....MAN, I am not sure how I feel about this. Don't take this the wrong way, it definitely looks like you are just using technology to produce art/craft in your own way. I will definitely look into this the next time I am writing cover letters — that I  dread. Tools/sites/docker-images that improve your workflow? Damn, kudos again. nullc on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I just tried GPT2 at cover letters and I can't figure out a prompt that gets it to consistently write good ones, instead I can mostly get it to write bad ones (as in the sort of stuff you might see unsuccessful applicants submit). My example problem was to get it to apply to Y Combinator. It managed to misspell the organization which isn't something GPT2 normally does. Here are some examples: https://0bin.net/paste/RzN1n+cubZwvHDKc#hV5+TXf4eNRRB9ROuXIT... After the first time it produced "Dear Paul Graham," I stuck it on the end of my prompt as it tended to reliably produce a cover letter (and one for YC) rather than a blank job application form. Other than throwing lots of computing power at it: I find that it's useful to include some largely irrelevant flavour text in your prefixes that you can stir until you hit on a combination that triggers the results you want (seemingly random things will send the model off in vastly different directions).  When it has good initial output but goes off the rails to you can just terminate it at the last good part and continue from there-- a lot of GPT2's worst sins can be correct with fairly low effort that way. As mentioned, I think these examples are mostly pretty poor. I suspect that if I worked on it I could probably hit on a prompt that caused it to generate better cover letters... That said, there are perhaps a few things I might not have considered without reading them. saberience on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Maybe this is a dumb question, because you seem like someone who thinks in a radically different way to me. But why would you try and use GPT-2 to help you write better English versus actually learn to become a better writer yourself? I say this as someone who reads extensively and is considered a "good" writer and have won prizes before for my writing. I became a better writer through reading more books (especially classic literature) and writing more. Cribbing off a computer algorithm and copying and pasting seems like it would just be hurting your own growth, as well as being lazy to boot. nullc on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I don't care that much about being a 'good writer' at least not according to any abstract sense of good.  I care more about exploring interesting ideas and interesting interactions, joyful leaps of insight, surprise and serendipity.  Like in any other art just being different can have its own merit. The nearest I usually come to caring about good is that at times I aspire to be an /effective/ writer.  But in many cases I've found being an effective writer can requires making the far-out leap that no one else was making or it can depend on making good guesses at the minds of readers far different from my own.  While lucid language and fully formed ideas are necessary tools, the spice of something unfamiliarly or too familiar-- an allusion, even a silly or vulgar one, that people can't unstick from their minds, or anticipating their thoughts so that your writing speaks in harmony with their inner voice-- can really help a message stand out. Some of the most effective writing, as I see it, comes from taking a step back from the words on the page and asking yourself "what does this actually say about the world?"  Any tool that helps you adopt a different perspective can be useful to these ends. Working with the machine is not just copy-and-paste-- if it were, there would already be no more need for writers.  It is its own art and one that has yet to be mastered by anyone.  In particular tools like GPT2 are absurdly sensitive to the prompts.  There is also skill and creativity that can go into sampling, knowing when tell it to take greater or lesser risk, where to cut it off and retry or which word to insert to move it back in a fruitful direction. Fine details like what you name objects, people, and places implicitly signal to the model the genre of the writing and help guide it down useful paths or into blind allies.  We sometimes think about the connotations of the words we use but for the model the connotations are all that matter.  People talk some about bias in AI but in some sense the model is nothing but biases.  Strange biases, some alien and impervious to analysis, others are biting social commentary once you notice them. Writers have always used devices and tools of various forms-- narrative forms, patterns of speech, constrained writing, and so on-- and machine text generation is but one more.  I suppose that there are more dull ways of using it than brilliant ones, but that is true of any tool. We might write with a pen or a typewriter, but the tool doesn't become the author simply because we used it to write.  The same is true using the computer even if, at times, the line may be fuzzier. We also shouldn't kid ourselves: Good writing, however we define it, is both derivative and also dependant on a health dose of chance and luck.  If all the machine did was give us another way to be derivative or another way of finding fortunate statements by chance we could still find value in that alone. I don't think it's likely that I'll be the first to discover the best ways to use machine-co-authorship to improve writing, if such ways are ever to be discovered. Neither is it likely that I'll become a renowned writer by traditional means.  But the former currently has less competition and the latter has already been done. And besides, I find it fun. nstart on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] I'll be honest, I've followed the evolution of gpt's text generation and this is the first one that has successfully avoided the obvious contradictory nonsensical sentences. Social media also trains us to consume quickly rather than thoughtfully. Not a great look overall. As a whole, the article reads like someone who isn't very clear in what they want to say. Paragraph wise and section wise, the bot has generated a very clearly on topic text. No more 3 horned unicorns found on the flat hills of Norway style weird continuations. I can actually as a human try and interpret what was meant to be said in a paragraph. At most, I'd probably say "huh.. that's a weird thing to say". But I wouldn't think "huh... That sounds like a bot wrote that" And it's the latter that is most interesting. I think a blog maintained secretly by this bot would eventually be considered as "eh, that's a lot of articles that say a lot of words and don't go very far". But it's unlikely that it would be considered as a bot maintained blog. This has considerable implications with the combination of deep fakes to create giant controversy driving content farms. I don't think we are adjusting fast enough to deal with this future. Our education systems don't train us to critically evaluate beyond the headline and the bullet points. Our news cycles encourage us to churn through information, share, move on. The ability to work through information slowly and critically is going to become a vital skill way sooner than anyone can imagine. At least, as far as probabilities are concerned, it's not a certainty yet but the probability is very very high it goes this way. rasz on July 19, 2020 | parent | next [–] http://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.ht...

The first mention of 'Elon Musk' (who left the board) and this sentence alone gave me the tip-off that GPT-3 had generated that (and the whole blog) and it's following prediction makes no sense. Sure, it may be used for nefarious purposes, but no-one can train GPT-3 in any acceptable time except for those with access to large GPU/ASIC compute power (OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, NVIDIA, etc.) Without the model,  it is not possible to adapt it to any other purpose, unless OpenAI does it for them. Without a detection mechanism, it is very dangerous. Nice try and a great GPT-3 hype experiment, (mostly by friends of OpenAI). I look forward to the day that GPT-3 gets proper scrutiny from the actual wider tech industry before we can safely use it with detection methods. smallnamespace on July 19, 2020 | parent | next [–] > no-one can train GPT-3 in any acceptable time except Gwern, who has spent probably as much time with GPT-3 and GPT-2 as any 'amateur' out there, is publicly out there saying that for most use cases, GPT-3 + creative use of prompts gets you better results than GPT-2 with finetuning . That's an amazing capability that Gwern elaborates on more here: > A new programming paradigm? The GPT-3 neural network is so large a model in terms of power and dataset that it exhibits qualitatively different behavior: you do not apply it to a fixed set of tasks which were in the training dataset, requiring retraining on additional data if one wants to handle a new task (as one would have to retrain GPT-2); instead, you interact with it, expressing any task in terms of natural language descriptions, requests, and examples, tweaking the prompt until it “understands” & it meta-learns the new task based on the high-level abstractions it learned from the pretraining. This is a rather different way of using a DL model, and it’s better to think of it as a new kind of programming, where the prompt is now a “program” which programs GPT-3 to do new things. https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#prompts-as-programming Almost all the GPT-3 results you see on Twitter are via the OpenAI API - no finetuning, only prompting. That implies... > Without the model, it is not possible to adapt it to any other purpose, unless OpenAI does it for them ... that we're actually very far from plumbing the possible ranges of behavior of GPT-3 with different sorts of prompting. This is a new ballgame folks. The old rules don't quite apply here. yomly on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I don't really understand your post (and don't know much about GPT3) are you suggesting that the model is stateful in that it can continue learning from successive prompts? Maybe you can elaborate on this: >instead, you interact with it, expressing any task in terms of natural language descriptions, requests, and examples, tweaking the prompt until it “understands” & it meta-learns the new task based on the high-level abstractions it learned from the pretraining. Or are you suggesting that it has such a deep network of abstractions that once a user starts to map that out, the mileage they can extract back out of the model via prompts is very exciting. smallnamespace on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The model is not stateful, but you can emulate state (certainly with GPT-3, but also with other language models) by simply feeding back earlier output. For example, to simulate a chatbot, you start with a prompt. You then successively feed longer and longer chunks of the full chat back to the model, taking incrementally generated lines as the new AI's reply. This is essentially how some of the 'use GPT-2 as a chatbot' front ends work in the world. This is also extended to make things like AI dungeon work: you can force the model to keep context within its attention by providing a good summary in the prompt. To speculate a bit on why this seems to work, these models are massive and have read millions of texts in their corpus. Instead of 'retraining' on text which the model probably has already seen, the prompt is nudging the model to identify where in its on weights its encoded the knowledge before. walleeee on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I don't think the claim is that the model is "stateful" in that it continues to learn from prompts. I think it's that the model no longer requires retraining for different situations; instead it has "learned" a set of lower (higher?) level abstractions from which those same (and possibly new) situations can be constructed dynamically from the input prompt. graham_paul on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] > no-one can train GPT-3 in any acceptable time except for those with access to large GPU/ASIC compute power (OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, NVIDIA, etc.) Any state actor has access to large compute power zaroth on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I thought it cost about $10 million to train. Honestly, seems fairly cheap all things considered. If it could be 100x smarter for only 100x more (whatever handwavey thing that really means) it would be a steal considering how the same model could be reused by thousands of companies without retraining. briga on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] But it might be hard to attract talented AI engineers to live in, say, North Korea rsync on July 20, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] "... it might be hard to attract talented AI engineers to live in, say, North Korea ..."

Sure, but this is akin to seeing bad science journalism and tarring the science itself with the same brush. GPT-3 still factually has certain properties, independently of anyone making grandiose assertions about those properties. What those properties are , we can only say slightly—e.g. we know it’s capable of generating certain texts eventually , among an unbounded corpus of other texts it may have generated that were then human-discarded. But the fact that it can generate those texts at all —faster than brute-force, I mean—is an interesting fact on its own, worthy of scrutiny independent of whatever airier claims are being made. BickNowstrom on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] It is certainly impressive, and I don't want to discard GPT-3. Just critiquing the (smart) release: make a select few feel special by giving them API access, and watch your product dominate the tech - and news cycle for weeks. You'll have VC money in the bank before showing actual worth or business value. Maybe a bit simplistic, but I view GPT as a Markov chain text generator, operating on word vectors instead of word tokens, and having a larger look-back. It's like a child copying a joke, because she heard adults laughing about it, but she does not understand the punchline. You wouldn't say that child understands or even displays humor, despite substituting "horse" with "donkey" when retelling the joke. Filligree on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] If you want to play with GPT-3, you can do so right now. Go to https://play.aidungeon.com Make an account, and select the "Dragon" model. That's GPT-3. I've spent ten hours playing with it over the last two days. It isn't perfect, and it feels short of the hype it's generating about itself, but it's an amazing leap nonetheless. It really seems to have an understanding of causality, biology, all sorts of fictional themes... It isn't perfect. You frequently have to back it up and try again. Unless you make good use of the site's long-term memory function, it'll forget anything that happened over a page ago, and a lot of the time its idea of what should happen next doesn't match the plot I had in mind. I'm getting better at that. However, as a writer myself, I can say that this is just as true for human writers as well. For every final draft you see there are ten discarded ones, and a hundred that never made it to paper. Viewed that way, GPT-3 is actually much better at the core part of writing than I am! It's more creative, it uses English better, it's better at matching the narration to the characters than I am... It's just that this isn't enough. It's missing a full model of the world, and it doesn't know how to look at what it's written and decide if it matches its intent, or whether it'll break consistency or get in the way later. It doesn't have an intent. It doesn't know about consistency. But that's also true for that part of me. GPT-3 isn't a human-level writer. What I've determined, however, is that it's a huge part of one, and it's more than good enough to fulfill the role of that part already. Now we just need the other nine tenths. derefr on July 20, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] > it doesn't know how to look at what it's written and decide if it matches its intent, or whether it'll break consistency or get in the way later. And we can build other models specifically for this. We don't need to add this stuff to GPT-3; GPT-3 can literally act as a part, a component. GPT-3 can serve the role in a larger model that "imagination" does in a human brain—being fed inputs; having corresponding outputs scavenged through by the rest of the model; and then being "fed back" with input that relates to the scavenged outputs. One thing I'd be very curious to see tried, is to get a system consisting of GPT-3 as "writer", and some other (summarization?) model as "editor", to attempt to dramatize or adapt into prose fiction, a machine-readable sequence of events (e.g. a machinima recording of a stage-play enacted within an MMO game.) We already have models that turn machine-readable sequences of events directly into prose; see e.g. baseball news reporting. Such models can work just as well in reverse, summarizing in-domain prose back into machine-readable facts. So if you take such a prose-to-factual-assertions "reading comprehension" model, and feed it GPT-3's output; and then measure the distance between the set of events comprehended by the "reading comprehension" model from GPT-3's output, and the source data (which is also in the form of a set of factual assertions), then you can iterate GPT-3 — maybe even one additional line of prose at a time — to find a story that is a consistent adaptation of the source. In this sense, GPT-3 is acting as a programmer, and the "reading comprehension" model as a compiler — with the compiler reaching out and erasing any line that doesn't compile. Of course, you're limited in this by the "reading level" of the reading-comprehension model. But this is also true of humans; you can't get out a literary classic if the writer's editor and alpha-readers were five-year-olds. nullc on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] The domain is play.aidungeon.io and the GPT3 based version is only available to sponsors right now.

Tarrosion on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I just spent an hour or so playing around with the paid version of AI Dungeon, and was super unimpressed. It's pretty fun for a moment, sure, and I assume some really heroic work went into building it. I'm not saying the creators did a poor job so much as the task is really hard and the final result is...lacking. The "Dragon" (GPT-3) engine responds reasonably to any particular input, but clearly lacks a coherent state of the world. Objects appear and disappear; plot cues are given and then can never be summoned again if not immediately grabbed, environments change dramatically without explanation, etc. Do you feel otherwise? ilaksh on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Right.  It has some type of language ability, but no world modeling.  So overall it really doesn't make sense. But since that is so obvious, I assume many people are trying to figure out how to improve it.  So I am excited to see if they can make progress in the next few years. It is going to be quite difficult though.  I think it might require integrating a totally different type of subsystem, if it is possible at all. But the ability to make realistic sounding language is a step forward it seems to me. killerstorm on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] Why do you believe they won't release the model? It's Open AI after all. Google, NVIDIA and Microsoft also make their models freely available. Google already trained a model which is bigger than GPT-3. There might be some delay, but no fundamental problem with it. Fine-tuning the entire GPT-3 is impossible on a single GPU. But it's still possible to fine-tune specific layers. Plus, I'm sure somebody will release a distilled version of it which is more manageable. polyanos on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] >Why do you believe they won't release the model?

The model is so large you can't run it on a single GPU, AFAIK. OpenAI developed an infrastructure to run the model efficiently.

It's practical, useful, and makes life easier, great. It'll replace a lot of jobs, indeed.

Imnimo on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] I'm surprised that GPT-3 understands how to write coherently about GPT-3.  Common Crawl, the bulk of GPT-3's training data, was collected even before GPT-2 was published.  Maybe the Wikipedia dump they used was recent enough to contain a few references to GPT-2, but that's it.  So if GPT-3 never saw any discussion of GPT-3, and probably almost no discussion of GPT-2, in its training data, how does it know what they are?  The prompt text does give a hint that it's a language prediction model, but that hardly seems like it should be enough. nullc on July 19, 2020 | parent | next [–] I mean, you could write coherently about GPT3 without ever hearing about it before-- right?

I don't think I could have done that if you had asked me before GPT-2 was published (which is essentially what we're doing if GPT-3's training data predates GPT-2).

A prototype that had predicted replies that were convincing in most cases would be much more impressive than the GPT-3 I describe here, although that would probably require many years of training and many iterations of improvements on the model It essentially adopts a common convention for hype articles:  A pile of breathless exaggerated hype and then a brief conclusion that suggests that the approach hardly works at the current time, at least if you're reading between the lines. :) I think it's more surprising that it didn't stray further into fantasy.

I think writers block is a thing because writers might not have someone to bounce their ideas off of.  Perhaps due to the author trying to preserve intellectual property / secrecy of their project, or perhaps the people they CAN share with may not be in the same space creatively as they are.

That will hasten the demise of the internet as a democratic medium, because intelligent people will be increasingly reluctant to wager their time and attention on unvetted prose of uncertain provenance. This has been the trend for some years now, but it is going to accelerate very rapidly. glenstein on July 19, 2020 | parent | next [–] >That will hasten the demise of the internet as a democratic medium I think you are more or less right, unfortunately.

I could tell that something was off when reading through this. The logic didn’t flow and there were contradictions that defeated the previous point. Even more, it wasn’t clear if there was a theme - more like a rambling story. However, I wouldn’t be surprised if someone told me this was written in a High School English class - as a rough draft. That is where it occurred to me, that if this was given to a human editor to clean up, it could be interesting. For example, if writing a creative work of fiction - this could generate a starting point for the human author to refine. This could be done in an interative process: - Generate a chunk of text (or multiple chunks). - Edit that into a final text. - Use that as input for the next chunk. - etc. DonHopkins on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] Reminds me of the time I fed RMS's infamous Natalism Flame into the Eliza-like Doctor "AI" in Emacs: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsDoctor >Emacs Doctor >When life, the universe and everything is all getting too much, Emacs has doctor.el to help.

Starting from a buffer of straight English, it produces extremely amusing output. The input comes from the current Emacs buffer. Dissociated Press writes its output in a buffer named ` Dissociation ', and redisplays that buffer after every couple of lines (approximately) so you can read the output as it comes out. >Dissociated Press asks every so often whether to continue generating output. Answer n to stop it. You can also stop at any time by typing C-g. The dissociation output remains in the ` Dissociation ' buffer for you to copy elsewhere if you wish. >Dissociated Press operates by jumping at random from one point in the buffer to another. In order to produce plausible output rather than gibberish, it insists on a certain amount of overlap between the end of one run of consecutive words or characters and the start of the next. That is, if it has just output `president' and then decides to jump to a different point in the file, it might spot the `ent' in `pentagon' and continue from there, producing `presidentagon'.(15) Long sample texts produce the best results. >A positive argument to M-x dissociated-press tells it to operate character by character, and specifies the number of overlap characters. A negative argument tells it to operate word by word and specifies the number of overlap words. In this mode, whole words are treated as the elements to be permuted, rather than characters. No argument is equivalent to an argument of two. For your againformation, the output goes only into the buffer ` Dissociation '. The buffer you start with is not changed. >Dissociated Press produces nearly the same results as a Markov chain based on a frequency table constructed from the sample text. It is, however, an independent, ignoriginal invention. Dissociated Press techniquitously copies several consecutive characters from the sample between random choices, whereas a Markov chain would choose randomly for each word or character. This makes for more plausible sounding results, and runs faster. >It is a mustatement that too much use of Dissociated Press can be a developediment to your real work. Sometimes to the point of outragedy. And keep dissociwords out of your documentation, if you want it to be well userenced and properbose. Have fun. Your buggestions are welcome. The MIT AI Lab's ITS operating system even had a Dissociated Press device which would let you dissociate any file on the system by using the "DP:" device name prefix: https://github.com/PDP-10/its/blob/4e2ea8e4d851a0ea1f910c300... stared on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] "...since Bitcoin" - I hope not.

Here I got a false negative. simonkafan on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] I agree that the text generation has improved dramatically. But there is a big gap between "generating gramatically correct sentences" and "sentences that express an elaborated idea". For example: > I was thinking of how cool it would be to build a Twitter-like service where the only posts are GPT-3 outputs. Why would I need that? There are better ways for entertainment. > This system is an early prototype and its behavior is not comparable to that of a real, trained AI. Nonsense. This made it clear for me that the author (= GPT-3) has no real clue what it's talking about. Even though this looks like we got one step closer to text understanding - we did not. We just got better in obfuscating that those algorithms have no real sense and clue of what they talk about. Myrmornis on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] It seems like it's going to be a bit of a challenge for teachers grading homework essays to establish authorship. But on the other hand I think it could make a good high school English exercise for students to have to distinguish human from machine authors. d_burfoot on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] Here's an important thing to keep in mind: GPT-3 was trained without any labelled data , just huge amounts of raw text. Nobody spent man-years annotating sentences to help the system learn grammar, sentiment, topic understanding, etc. redm on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] I'm catching up on the GPT-* news, but its pretty interesting. "GPT-3 is the latest in a series of text-generating neural networks. The name GPT stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer, referencing a 2017 Google innovation called a Transformer which can figure out the likelihood that a particular word will appear with surrounding words. Fed with a few sentences, such as the beginning of a news story, the GPT pre-trained language model can generate convincingly accurate continuations, even including the formulation of fabricated quotes." It sounds a lot like a fancy version of PageRank for words. The results are impressive though. Like Grammerly + PageRank. tlrobinson on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] I made it about halfway through before I thought to myself: "It would be a trip if this blog post were actually written by GPT-3". Mind successfully blow. Now, which of the comments on this HN post were written by GPT-3? ;) theon144 on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] Yeah, somewhere around first third, I skipped to the end to see if there was something about the text being GPT-3 generated. I can't say what exactly ticked me off, but it's written in this very meandering, vacuous way - I wasn't really sure what the article was going for, some paragraphs are outright pointless (2nd in "Are you being served", for instance) - but of course, those are not solely marks of AI-generated text, but also of simply bad writing. To realize that AI is now capable of producing a bad, but passable article without being obviously nonsensical, is still astonishing. zitterbewegung on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] You can get very good results by cherry-picking outputs .

Specially because it seems to require much less examples to learn from than GPT-2. And before someone says this might eliminate jobs, it wont. It might do boring parts like CRUD code and validation like this or more advanced: if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(user.Name)) {         throw new ValidationException("Please provide a name.");     } Devs will instead get to do less boring, more creative work. Win-win. dorkwood on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] It's funny, I was making a running tally in my head of the things I was confused about in the article, or the threads the author started that they never wrapped up. For example, I was ready to come here and challenge the author on this point: > I could not stop thinking about the applications of such a technology and how it could improve our lives. I didn't actually think that I was reading generated content, though. I guess there's enough confusing writing online that this article wasn't too much of an outlier. killerstorm on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] Judging from a bitcointalk experiment it imagined, I think it would be hilarious to unleash it upon the internet.

I wouldn't be so alarmed. The Internet is already filled with quasi-coherent misinformed writing that's generated by humans in good faith. That's exactly the reason why we rely on our peers' judgement through sites like HN or through social media to select the bits that deserve our attention despite being misinformed and quasi-coherent. walrus01 on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] I think my favorite use of GPT-3 so far has to be the artificially created variations on the famous Navy Seals copypasta.

We will become cyborgs, but not in the dystopian usually described in movies/books, but the one usually described in Asimov novels (like Johnny Mnemonic though I know is not Asimov's novel, but no title comes to mind).

Training your an even more expensive endeavor. Presumably this is how they are justifying the for-a-price API; "its not like you can run it on your home computer anyway". For now, the API is private and geared towards researchers. Still a bit bollocks though.

Then again, it's been spoon-fed 2020's Internet, so no surprise there. stagas on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] This is a perfect demonstration on how subjectively we interpret text. Our minds fill in the blanks, we read what we want to read as long as the text is above some certain threshold of coherence, that apparently GPT-3 has tipped over. This proves reading depends on the reader, the writer only throws clues semi-randomly and the meaning we assemble ourselves. andreyk on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] Quite good, with some exceptional paragraphs like this making it at least read as bad writing - "I chose bitcointalk.org as the target environment for my experiments for a variety of reasons: It is a popular forum with many types of posts and posters."

If such how can it be used easily? The article mentions getting access to an API, so is it an online service? Or, there's the pre-trained model (please, a tutorial!) and a service for those that don't want to configure it locally? swayson on July 19, 2020 | parent | next [–] Nope, OpenAI didn't release the weights to the public, only a web API which is in private beta. fierarul on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Thank you. seek3r00 on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] “I could not stop thinking about the applications of such a technology and how it could improve our lives.

I'm told this particular author's entry was subsequently removed. Hm, let's see what the PR person says. So, other ideas that I want to mention: There's an entry with a huge crop of people pasted in, but other than that, the input is pretty sporadic. Maybe they could be arranged and directed? There's an odd history at the top of the list. Some of these people are that Waylon Jennings. People have been discussed pretty tightly, but that's enough to suggest they're part of that: "Vokoun" and "Carter" seem pretty stable. I can't help but wonder if the "Vokoun" entries could come from the Vokoun journal itself, and be part of the Hall of Mirrors. blhack on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] Does anybody have a link to a howto on how to install and play around with this?

Given the latest developments, I would put the odds at fifty-fifty within the next decade. graham_paul on July 19, 2020 | parent | next [–] > Given the latest developments, I would put the odds at fifty-fifty within the next decade. thing is technological development is not linear, you can't predict future development based on the last n decades.

A lot of the value here comes from its potential rather than its current use drcode on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I neither claimed tech development was linear, nor am I basing future AI progress on the rate of progress in the last decades. I am basing future AI progress on what AI can do in July of 2020, which I believe already represents substantial progress towards that goal. thom on July 19, 2020 | parent | prev | next [–] How would you measure human level AI? qayxc on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Since intelligence isn't a  well-defined term, the default fall-back would be a measurement by proxy. Humans are usually tasked with solving an IQ-test as the most common proxy. A human level AI could do just the same. If the AI scores  above 50 points, it can be considered human level (though literally retarded). visarga on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] The measure of intelligence, François Chollet https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547 qayxc on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] Thanks for the interesting read! It was a bit tiresome (a 38 page history lesson, followed by a 5 page introduction and only about 5 pages of actual content), but very informative nonetheless. The proposed method is very hard to distinguish from a traditional IQ test (or a subset thereof) and the first to parts (~38 pages) basically serve as a justification for this. In the end the author admits that the proposed method lacks test diversity, has no established validity and has no way of qualifying results. The essay just stops where it gets interesting (i.e. at the point where the actual science starts), which left me a bit disappointed in the end t.b.h. It's a great summary of the history and development of the field and the methodologies used therein. It's in no way a solution to measuring and quantifying general intelligence, though. drcode on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think the only measure that makes sense is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it manquer on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] ironically being able to do that is a key aspect of intelligence . mnm1 on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] GPT-3 is a better writer, grammatically, than the author, but my first reaction to the article was that it's nonsense. Glad to see that it is indeed nonsense. Grammatically pleasing nonsense but nonsense nevertheless. Mildly interesting at best that AI can generate nonsensical bullshit. The question is, can it generate bullshit that makes some sense, politician style? That would be impressive. api on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] So it will be a massive bubble that sets billions of dollars on fire with little to nothing to show at the end? bouncycastle on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] The irony is bitcoin didn't disrupt anything. Most of it is propped up by memes & hype, that made a few people rich. While it was impressive at the beginning and made many news stories, the technology itself is unsustainable, unscalable, with big usability problems. Disappointing to say the least. (Perhaps that's what the author of the article was subtly implying?) vasili111 on July 19, 2020 | parent | next [–] The article is not about bitcoin. Read it until the end :) bouncycastle on July 19, 2020 | root | parent | next [–] I see, thanks :-) nutanc on July 19, 2020 | prev | next [–] The main thing to consider is the author choosing the sentences. The author says they only made a couple( less than 10) edits. But the human input is what is important. I remember something similar when GPT2 came out(I think it was an interview conducted by GPT2, with human tuning). I have been following the twitter hype on GPT-3.  @quasimondo has done some excellent analysis on text generation using GPT-3. For me, when reading GPT-3 text, something is off. It jumps around too much. It does not seem to care. I couldn't read more than 10 sentences if the text is completely GPT-3 generated. But if prompted properly by the human at regular intervals, it sounds ok. Generally it holds a thought upto one paragraph. So maybe the usefulness of GPT-3 is in scenarios like, I have a thought, I want to complete it, I fire up GPT-3, prompt it and generate different results, choose one which is closest to my thoughts and edit it and publish. I am sure that's what this blog author did. GPT-3 is really good at NLG. But people seem to be extrapolating the results to NLP. nikolay on July 19, 2020 | prev [–] Bitcoin was a big thing. You mean, in terms of scams and theft? Have you paid via Bitcoin recently? It's neither fast not cheap. For example, sending money with Venmo, Zelle, Cash is instantaneous and free - unlike with Bitcoin, which is pretty expensive. And when you consider the purchase and sale, it's actually very, very expensive and not smooth. Join us for AI Startup School this June 16-17 in San Francisco!
