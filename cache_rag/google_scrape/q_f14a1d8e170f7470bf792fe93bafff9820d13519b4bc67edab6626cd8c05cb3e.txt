[ 1 ] It was her first major title. [ 2 ] Rybakina was the first Kazakhstani [ i ] to win a major, and the third player representing an Asian nation to win a major after Li Na and Naomi Osaka . She was the first player to win from a set down in the final since Amélie Mauresmo in 2006 . Jabeur was the first Arab to reach a major singles final, the first African woman to do so in the Open Era , and the first African woman to do so not representing South Africa. [ 3 ] [ ii ] This marked the first time since 2009 that both finalists represented non-European nations. Ashleigh Barty was the reigning champion, but she retired from professional tennis in March 2022. [ 4 ] World No. 1 Iga Świątek 's win streak of 37 matches (dating back to Qatar in February) ended when she was defeated by Alizé Cornet in the third round. It was just the fourth loss of Świątek's season ; her 37-match winning streak is the longest of the 21st century, and tied for 12th-longest in the Open Era. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] For the second time in her career, Cornet defeated the incumbent world No. 1 in the third round at Wimbledon ; she had defeated then-five-time champion Serena Williams at that stage in 2014 . [ 5 ] By making her 62nd consecutive major main draw appearance, Cornet tied Ai Sugiyama 's all-time record . [ 8 ] Williams received a wild card to play in the tournament, making her comeback to the sport after a year away due to a right hamstring injury; [ 9 ] she was defeated in the first round by Harmony Tan . [ 10 ] This would be the seven-time champion's last appearance at the tournament, as she retired from professional tennis after the 2022 US Open . This was also the final Wimbledon appearance for 2019 champion and former world No. 1 Simona Halep ; she lost to Rybakina in the semifinals. This was the first edition of Wimbledon to feature a champions tiebreak , a 10-point tiebreak when the score reaches six games all in the third set, [ 11 ] and the third edition to feature a final-set tiebreak rule. [ iii ] The first women's singles main draw match of the tournament to feature the 10-point tiebreak was the first round match between Caroline Garcia and Yuriko Miyazaki , with Garcia emerging victorious.

Seedings are based on WTA rankings as of 20 June 2022. Rankings and points are as before 27 June 2021. The WTA decided not to award ranking points for the 2022 tournament in response to the All England Club 's decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players from participating. Points dropping from the 2021 tournament will accordingly be replaced by the player's next best result, regardless of her performance at Wimbledon in 2022. [ 14 ] Note that 2021 points were mandatory for WTA players, unlike for ATP players, who were subject to a different rankings adjustment system.
