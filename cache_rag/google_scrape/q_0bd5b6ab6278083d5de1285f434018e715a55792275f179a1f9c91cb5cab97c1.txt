Discussion In my opinion and experience, Director's Cuts go one of three ways. One: it perfectly portrays why editors are a necessary part of the team. Two: It shows when a director truly was stopped from showing their vision on screen and that their cut was the correct one. Three: You're David Lynch, and your deleted scenes become an entirely separate movie. There doesn't seem to be much of an in-between. We can all name iconic Directors Cuts that improved upon the films like The Exorcist, Aliens, Apocalypse Now, etc. But oftentimes, the things that were left on the cutting room floor need to stay there So I'm curious if others feel differently and believe Director's Cuts are more likely to be an improvement. and if so, what Director's Cuts do you think are superior to the theatrical release? Criterion film answers are a priority, but I wouldn't mind hearing about others. Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
