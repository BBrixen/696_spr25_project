Jared Alex Tan 16 Aug 2019 Apple released the seventh beta version of iOS13 to developers today, and might have accidentally revealed the launch date of the upcoming iPhone 11 in the process. An image included in the latest beta — titled “HoldForRelease”— shows the Calendar app set at September 10th, which suggests that Apple will unveil the newest iPhone four weeks from now. If this sounds a little far-fetched, hear us out: a similar image showed up in the iOS12 beta last year, showing the calendar at September 12th. The iPhone XS was subsequently announced on — you guessed it — September 12th.

SoftBank President Ken Miyauchi also recently suggested that the iPhone 11 will start shipping on September 20th, which lines up with the phone being announced on the 10th. If you ask us, that’s more than enough evidence to put the unveiling date at September 10th. So If you’ve been planning to  buy a new iPhone, you should definitely wait a few more weeks.
