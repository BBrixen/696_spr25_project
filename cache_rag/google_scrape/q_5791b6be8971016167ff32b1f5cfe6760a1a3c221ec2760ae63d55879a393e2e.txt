Simply pointing out whether someone is left or right wing isn't winning the argument. 2. If a joke is good enough, it can be enjoyed by anyone. 3. It's not all about you. 4. Just because you're offended, doesn't mean you're right. January 8, 2020 [ 11 ] Criticism arose following Ricky Gervais ' opening monologue, which was seen as an attack on the perceived hypocrisy of Hollywood . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] He joked about several controversial topics, such as the death of Jeffrey Epstein , the college admissions scandal and the middle-aged Leonardo DiCaprio 's dating history with younger women. Gervais also jokingly accused the Hollywood Foreign Press of racism for its lack of diversity and an "In Memoriam" section, mocked Amazon , Apple and Disney for their unfair labor practices , and chastised awardees who talk about their political views in acceptance speeches. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Gervais' comments attained mixed reactions across the political spectrum; while conservatives highly praised Gervais, [ 16 ] journalists from liberal outlets were more critical, [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] with Rolling Stone ' s Rob Sheffield calling his monologue "incredibly stale". [ 20 ] Of the criticism, Gervais said it was the "best ever" and later defended his jokes in a tweet .
