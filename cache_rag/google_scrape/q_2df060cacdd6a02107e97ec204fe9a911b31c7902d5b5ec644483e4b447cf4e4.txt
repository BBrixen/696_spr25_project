Based on Strata‚Äôs projected 2025 Adj. EBITDA, the purchase price of $454 million reflects a multiple in the high single digits. Founded in 1910, Strata is an aggregates-based, vertically integrated company with over 75 aggregates locations, extensive aggregate reserves and rail assets to bring those reserves to market. The company has 28 ready-mix plants, three asphalt plants and a contracting services division that specializes in asphalt paving and concrete construction. Strata is headquartered in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and will provide infill growth for Knife River‚Äôs Central Segment. ‚ÄúStrata is respected among its peers and in its communities, and is well-known for its strong culture and expertise,‚Äù said Knife River President and CEO Brian Gray. ‚ÄúIt is a great success story ‚Äì growing from a single gravel operation into a leading supplier of construction materials that employs over 900 team members during the peak season. We look forward to completing the transaction and welcoming the Strata team to the Life at Knife.‚Äù The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Knife River expects to use cash on hand and the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt to finance the acquisition. ‚ÄúWe believe this acquisition is a prime example of our ‚ÄòCompetitive EDGE‚Äô strategy to profitably grow our business,‚Äù Gray said. ‚ÄúWe expect Strata to be accretive to Knife River‚Äôs Adj. EBITDA margin within the first year. Strata‚Äôs high-quality assets allow us to expand our service territory within a region we know well. We believe this is a great, long-term fit for us.‚Äù Strata was founded 114 years ago as Bradshaw Gravel Supply. Majority shareholder James Bradshaw oversaw much of the company‚Äôs growth during his 46 years as president. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not easy building a family business and it‚Äôs even harder coming to the point where you are ready to step away from it,‚Äù Bradshaw, Strata‚Äôs chairman and CEO, said. ‚ÄúI believe there is a great fit between Strata and Knife River. Both companies are strongly aligned with our cultures of putting people first and operating with integrity. We want what is best for our team and their future, and we believe that is with Knife River.‚Äù https://lnkd.in/g6NpFfnw Knife River Enters Definitive Agreement to Acquire Strata Corporation investors.kniferiver.com 161 7 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Pit & Quarry magazine 16,109 followers 4mo Report this post Eagle Materials came to an agreement this week to acquire BULLSKIN STONE & LIME, LLC , an aggregate-producing company located in western Pennsylvania.
