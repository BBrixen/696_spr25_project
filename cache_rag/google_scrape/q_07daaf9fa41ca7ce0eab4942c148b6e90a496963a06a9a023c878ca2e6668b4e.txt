Note : This episode was partially filmed with animation due to production being shut down halfway through the episode's filming from the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic . For the first time in the show's history, the "fourth wall" was broken as the cast and crew addressed the audience directly at both the beginning and end of the episode. Production [ edit ] In March 2019, NBC renewed the series for a seventh season, with the original cast set to reprise their roles. [ 22 ] On March 14, 2020, Sony Pictures Television suspended production on the series following the COVID-19 pandemic . [ 23 ] The final episode utilizes animation to complete the episode, as it had been in the middle of filming when production was suspended. The actors were able to record dialogue for the animation from their homes. [ 24 ] The producers considered having the cast "read their lines while an old fashioned radio appeared on the TV screen, or just putting voiceover to still comic book frames" before settling on fully animated sequences. [ 25 ] Thought bubbles and text boxes were also added "to help bridge the gap" between the animated sequences and the live action footage. The animation was created by previsualization studio Proof, Inc in London and Atlanta, [ 26 ] and was made to look like the style of The Blacklist comics and old Batman comics. [ 25 ] 35 artists worked to create approximately 20 minutes of footage for the episode. [ 26 ] Additionally, the plots from the three unproduced episodes were being considered for season eight. [ 25 ] Casting [ edit ] Laura Sohn joined the cast as a new Task Force member Alina Park. Joely Richardson had been cast as Cassandra Bianchi. The character has been described as "elegant, charming and ruthless", and is a former lover of Raymond Reddington.
