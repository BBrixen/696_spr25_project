Using qualitative, semi-quantitative, and statistical methods, the article traces how Tesla acquired a first-mover advantage and how second movers, both established automakers and start-ups, responded to Tesla’s rise. The recent decline in Tesla’s share of the U.S. electric vehicle market is linked to several factors: the proliferation of electric vehicle offerings from competitors, changes in public policy, and controversial decisions by Tesla and its CEO. The article concludes with a discussion of promising future strategies for both Tesla and its competitors. Keywords: electric vehicle ; first-mover advantage ; market competition ; Tesla 1. Introduction No account of the rise of the plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) in the United States would be satisfactory without emphasis on the contributions of Tesla. A PEV is broadly defined as a vehicle that can be plugged in, is powered by an electric motor, and uses energy stored in an onboard battery. The definition includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs) that are powered by electric motors only and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) that can also be powered by an internal combustion engine fueled by liquid fuel. Tesla began in 2003 as a fragile start-up, barely skirting bankruptcy during the Great Recession (2007–2009) with assistance from private investors, a 10% stake from Daimler, a 2.5% stake from Toyota, and a USD 465 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy. Tesla’s initial public offering raised USD 226 million (2010), even though the company had not yet turned a profit and had sold only 1063 cars. Much of Wall Street’s enthusiasm for Tesla flowed from the bold vision of Elon Musk, who became CEO in 2008 [ 1 ]. The company capitalized on the spillover of lithium-ion battery technology from consumer electronics to the automotives. From 2010 to 2020, 79% of PEVs sold in the U.S. were Tesla products. The cumulative number of PEVs sold in the United States from December 2010 to December 2023 was 4.7 million. More than half of those were Tesla products, primarily the Model 3 (2017 to present) and the Model Y SUV (2020 to present). The commercial success of the Model 3 and Model Y built on the reputation for innovation that Tesla had established with the Roadster sports car (2008–2012), the Model S luxury hatchback (2012–present), and the Model X luxury SUV (2015–present). The company’s first-mover advantage in the U.S. PEV market became so powerful that it took more than a decade for all other PEV manufacturers combined to push Tesla’s PEV market share of new PEVs below 50% (early 2024). How did Tesla establish its first-mover advantage? Why did it take so long for second movers to respond effectively? What factors contributed to the recent decline of Tesla’s dominance in the U.S. PEV market? We set out to answer these questions, using as a guide the established theoretical literature on the behaviors of first and second movers in competitive markets. We do not provide any assessment of Tesla’s success in China and Europe because those markets are different from that of the U.S. and thus require separate analyses [ 1 ]. Tesla’s entrance into the Chinese market was slowed by a 25% tariff on imported cars and subsidies for China’s EV and battery makers, both which helped BYD acquire a first-mover advantage in PEVs. In Europe, Tesla was not a major factor until after the VW emissions-cheating scandal (2015) and Tesla’s launch of its much-delayed Gigafactory in Berlin (March 2022). By then, the German and French automakers were already moving rapidly to battery electric vehicles (BEVs), neutralizing any first-mover advantage Tesla might have acquired in Europe [ 1 ]. We employ a comprehensive and empirically rigorous analysis of Tesla’s evolving role in the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) market, tracing its meteoric rise, strategic innovations, and the competitive forces driving its recent decline. We employ a structured three-period framework—comprising the Pioneers Period, the Second-Mover Period, and the First-Mover Erosion Period—to systematically examine how Tesla’s dominance has been shaped by shifting market dynamics, regulatory policies, and evolving consumer preferences. We introduce two empirical models that provide novel insights into Tesla’s market trajectory. First, building on the literature on consumer preferences and market competition, we employ a high-dimensional fixed-effects regression model to rigorously examine the determinants of Tesla’s market share, focusing on factors such as competitive responses from established automakers, product differentiation strategies, and the impact of public policies. This model allows us to quantitatively assess the strength of Tesla’s competitive advantage over time and how second movers have systematically narrowed the gap. Second, we introduce a heterogeneous effects framework with an interaction model, exploring how key external factors—such as tax credits and consumer sentiment—unequally influence Tesla’s market performance. A novel contribution is the development of the Tesla–Musk Image Score, an innovative index that quantifies the evolving public perception of Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk. This index was constructed through a systematic 20-year review of nationwide news coverage, social media discourse, and investor sentiment, allowing us to capture the impact of Musk’s controversial public stances, political affiliations, and strategic decisions on Tesla’s brand reputation and market demand. Moreover, our study highlights the proliferation of non-Tesla EV offerings, particularly in the First-Mover Erosion Period (2020–2024), when established automakers and start-ups (e.g., Rivian, Lucid) aggressively entered the EV market with competitive products. Unlike earlier challengers, these second movers have not only closed the technological gap with Tesla but have also addressed key consumer concerns such as pricing, reliability, and charging infrastructure—areas where Tesla once had a decisive edge. The rapid growth of non-Tesla EVs, coupled with Tesla’s own lack of significant product redesigns and price volatility, has further accelerated the company’s decline in market share. The insights generated in this work hold significant implications for both industry incumbents and new entrants, offering strategic guidance on how to navigate the evolving EV landscape amidst increasing competition, changing consumer sentiment, and policy-driven incentives. The article is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the relevant literature, providing a foundation for our analysis. Section 3 outlines our analytical framework, structured as a three-period analysis. Section 4 presents our findings on the evolution of the PEV market across these periods. In Section 5 , we introduce a model and our empirical results examining factors influencing Tesla’s market share. Finally, Section 6 discusses potential strategies that Tesla and its competitors may pursue in the foreseeable future. 2. Literature Review 2.1. Literature About Electric Vehicle Landscapes The research on electric vehicles encompasses several critical areas, including consumer preferences, supporting facility construction, industrial chain development, and New Energy Vehicles. Each of these areas has been extensively examined in the literature, providing valuable insights into the electric vehicle landscape. 2.1.1. Consumer-Level Factors Economic studies have delved into the factors influencing consumer adoption of electric vehicles, highlighting the significance of financial incentives, environmental awareness, and technological perceptions. For instance, Rapson and Muehlegger (2023) analyze how purchase subsidies and tax rebates reduce the effective price of EVs, thereby enhancing their attractiveness to consumers [ 2 ]. They emphasize that the optimal design of such incentives should consider regional variations in consumer behavior and environmental benefits to maximize policy effectiveness. Additionally, Mamkhezri (2024) investigates U.S. consumer attitudes toward BEVs and the energy sources powering them, finding that factors such as income, education level, and environmental consciousness significantly influence purchase intentions [ 3 ]. Graham and Brungard (2022) highlight that consumer preferences, particularly for affordability and practicality, are critical to achieving widespread adoption of PEVs. Early adopters tend to be affluent and environmentally conscious, but middle-income consumers prioritize affordability [ 4 ]. These studies collectively underscore the importance of aligning PEV attributes with consumer preferences to facilitate widespread adoption. 2.1.2. Supporting Facility Construction The availability, accessibility, and reliability of charging infrastructure are pivotal in mitigating range anxiety and promoting EV adoption. Wang et al. (2023) analyze China’s policies on electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVCI) [ 5 ], revealing that, while the policy system is comprehensive, there is an imbalance in the use of policy instruments across the industrial chain. They advocate for a more coordinated approach to policy implementation to effectively support EVCI development. Furthermore, Pesch et al. (2020) examine the economic viability and infrastructure requirements for electrifying highway traffic, highlighting challenges such as grid congestion and the need for strategic placement of charging stations to optimize both economic and operational efficiency [ 6 ]. These analyses highlight the necessity for strategic planning and investment in charging infrastructure to support the growing PEV market. 2.1.3. Industrial Chain Development The electric vehicle industrial chain begins with the mining and processing of raw materials and extends all the way to the recycling or reuse of batteries, motors, and other components. The chain encompasses battery production, vehicle manufacturing, and recycling. Each step in the chain must be analyzed to ensure sustainability and competitiveness. Zhao et al. (2024) assess the effects of China’s EV industry policies, such as purchase subsidies and public procurement, on private EV adoption [ 7 ]. Their findings indicate that these policies positively impact adoption rates, with regional consumer characteristics moderating their effectiveness. They suggest that tailoring industrial policies to regional consumer profiles can enhance the development of the EV industrial chain. Additionally, the International Energy Agency (2024) reports that China’s substantial investments in the EV sector have positioned it as a global leader, with significant implications for the global automotive supply chain. These insights underscore the importance of cohesive industrial policies and international collaboration in advancing the EV industry [ 8 ]. 2.1.4. Innovation Chain and Technological Advancements Technological innovation is a cornerstone of EV advancement, driving improvements in vehicle performance, cost reduction, and consumer acceptance. The International Energy Agency (2021) discusses policies promoting EV deployment, emphasizing the role of research and development in battery technologies and the integration of renewable energy sources [ 9 ]. Moreover, Wang et al. (2017) propose a multi-objective planning model for electric vehicle charging stations that considers urban traffic conditions, aiming to optimize the location and capacity of charging infrastructure to enhance user satisfaction and operational efficiency [ 10 ]. These studies highlight the critical role of continuous innovation and strategic planning in overcoming technological and infrastructural challenges in the EV sector. Battery electric vehicles have also seen significant advancements in recent years, driven by innovations in battery technology, drivetrain systems, and vehicle control frameworks. A breakthrough in chassis control technology is the energy-oriented torque-vector control framework introduced by Liang et al. (2023) for distributed drive electric vehicles (DDEVs) [ 11 ]. This hierarchical control strategy incorporates direct yaw moment control (DYC) to refine lateral dynamics and dynamically adjusts stability boundaries to achieve a balance between energy savings and stability. Recent work [ 12 ] has further advanced this field by proposing a hierarchical control strategy for independently driven electric vehicles that optimizes both handling stability and energy conservation. 2.2. Literature About Industrial Organization and Market Structure The changes in Tesla market share within the automotive industry can be understood through a multi-faceted lens that incorporates industrial organization theory, market competition, first-mover dynamics, structural modeling, and the unique characteristics of the U.S. automobile market. Industrial organization theory provides a foundational perspective for analyzing market share changes by studying the interplay between firm behavior and market structure. Classic works, such as that of Bain (1956) [ 13 ], emphasize the role of barriers to entry—such as economies of scale and high fixed costs—that historically allowed incumbents in the automotive industry to dominate. However, recent studies, including the seminal work by Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) (the BLP model), highlight that consumer preferences and product differentiation increasingly dictate market outcomes [ 14 ]. For example, the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) has disrupted the economies of scale advantage traditionally held by legacy automakers. Further, Sutton (1991) suggests that competitive dynamics are increasingly driven by endogenous sunk costs, such as investments in R&D and branding [ 15 ]. In the automotive industry, legacy manufacturers’ slower responses to these shifts often contribute to their market share erosion. These dynamics are further exacerbated by the declining relevance of traditional combustion engine vehicles in a market that is pivoting toward sustainability and technology-driven differentiation. From a market competition perspective, game theory and equilibrium models provide critical insights into how firms adapt to competitive pressures. Models like that of Hotelling (1929), which explore spatial competition and product differentiation, are particularly relevant to the automotive industry, where pricing, features, and innovation significantly influence equilibrium outcomes [ 16 ]. Studies such as that of Berry et al. (2004) provide a detailed analysis of consumer preferences and substitution patterns in the automotive market, demonstrating that firms’ success depends on their ability to align product characteristics with evolving consumer needs [ 17 ]. As the industry shifts toward electric and autonomous vehicles, firms that fail to innovate or remain cost competitive face heightened substitution risks and declining market share. The role of the first-mover advantage is central to understanding competitive dynamics in the automotive industry. Lieberman and Montgomery (1988) argue that early entrants can secure significant benefits through brand establishment, consumer loyalty, and economies of scale [ 18 ]. Tesla exemplifies this dynamic by pioneering the EV market, building extensive charging networks, and cementing its Silicon Valley reputation as an innovator. On the other hand, second-mover advantages arise when late entrants innovate or build on the market education efforts of pioneers. By refining products and responding to consumer needs, late entrants can surpass pioneers, as seen in the personal computer, wine cooler, and video game markets, where pioneers were eclipsed by later entrants [ 19 ]. Market potential also varies between pioneers and late movers. Pioneers initially face a small market potential, low consumer awareness, high trial costs, and elevated market entry risks [ 20 ]. Similarly, high failure rates among pioneers create opportunities for followers, who benefit from lower costs and informational spillovers when entering markets with reduced risks [ 21 ]. In industries with substantial R&D costs, second movers often achieve superior outcomes by waiting for uncertainties to resolve, enabling more efficient technology adoption [ 22 , 23 ]. Thus, while first movers frequently establish initial dominance, second movers can prevail through strategic innovation and market learning. 2.3. Literature About the U.S. Automobile Market The U.S. automobile market has long been a focal point for industrial organization studies due to its oligopolistic structure and historical dominance by the “Big Three” automakers: General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. Bresnahan (1987) conducted foundational work analyzing market power in the U.S. automobile industry, revealing how demand fluctuations and entry barriers contribute to firm behavior and pricing strategies [ 24 ]. Toyota surpassed GM for the first time in global sales volume in 2010 and in U.S. sales volume in 2022. GM’s share of the U.S. market in 1970 was about 70%, but it declined steadily in the pre-Tesla years to well less than 50%. By the time Tesla entered the U.S. market, Toyota was already the dominant player in the U.S. along with other successful transplants such as Honda, Hyundai/Kia, Mercedes, BMW, and Audi. GM’s dominance was undermined by the Japanese, Koreans, and Europeans before Tesla arrived. Now Tesla is hurting the German, European, Japanese and Korean manufacturers as much as GM, Ford and Stellantis. Tesla benefitted from being an outsider in a slow-moving industry complicated by deep relationships with franchised dealers. Its ability to bypass traditional dealership models and operate direct-to-consumer sales disrupted the conventional value chain, as highlighted by MacDuffie (2024) [ 25 ]. Additionally, government incentives such as tax credits for EV buyers provided Tesla with a competitive edge. However, as legacy automakers have embraced EV production, the structural dynamics have shifted. Established automakers have built entirely new assembly plants and supplier networks for PEVs. Only a few are producing PEVs and ICEs(internal combustion engines) at the same assembly plant. The regulatory system that forced early investments in PEVs was California’s zero-emission vehicle mandate. California’s mandate was eventually replicated by more than a dozen other states, covering almost 40% of the U.S. market. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards analyzed by Klier and Linn (2012) have further accelerated this shift, compelling traditional automakers to invest in EV technologies [ 26 ]. It was the ZEV mandate that forced all automakers to invest in PEVs in addition to the fuel-efficient gasoline vehicles stimulated by the CAFE. California, Oregon, and Washington were pioneers of the state-level zero-emission vehicle mandate. They also pioneered EV rebates for consumers and built public charging networks [ 1 ]. The West Coast states force automakers to offer PEVs if they wanted to play in the West Coast auto market. They also made it easier for automakers to play there, with state-level rebates to consumers, privileged access to HOV lanes for PEVs, and public charging networks. While states like California remain strongholds for EV adoption, the broader U.S. market is diversifying. The market for PEVs unfolded in the northeastern U.S. before the South and Midwest because the northeastern states adopted California’s zero-emission vehicle mandate and copied some of their consumer-level strategies to encourage EV adoption. Southern and Midwest states, where traditional automakers are establishing EV plants, are emerging as new hubs of competition. Rossi-Hansberg et al. (2021) emphasize that regional shifts in production and supply chain dynamics can significantly alter competitive advantages, a reality Tesla faces as it contends with increased competition in these regions [ 27 ]. First movers may encounter challenges from rapid technological changes and evolving consumer preferences, which can erode their early gains. Firms that effectively leverage their accumulated resources can sustain market leadership, while late entrants, who learn from pioneers’ mistakes, may strategically position themselves for long-term success [ 18 ]. Hyundai/Kia are playing the second-mover strategy quite effectively in the U.S. market, learning from the mistakes of the pioneering U.S. EV manufacturers. This dynamic is further complicated in international markets, where political resources provide additional non-market advantages for early movers [ 28 ]. In the convenience goods sector, where pioneers are believed to hold distribution advantages, pioneers generally enjoy higher market shares. By contrast, in industries with intensive advertising, pioneers do not necessarily maintain significantly higher shares [ 29 ]. Despite the stunning success of Tesla, the literature about the company is not universally positive. On the positive side are hypothesized explanations for Tesla’s success: how Tesla revolutionized the auto industry with software (e.g., updates that improve vehicle performance such as braking capabilities and acceleration are administered over WiFi by sending software updates) [ 30 , 31 ], how Tesla innovated with battery cooling and management systems and improved electric motor technology [ 1 ], how Tesla used vertical integration in the supply chain to establish a competitive advantage (i.e., 80% of the 8000 parts in the Model 3 are produced in house) [ 32 , 33 ], how Tesla combined low-volume, headline-grabbing products (e.g., the Roadster and the Cybertruck) that build “innovation capital” with high-volume premium products (e.g., the Model 3 and Model Y) [ 34 ], how Tesla developed a unique direct-to-consumers sales model that cut out cumbersome dealers [ 1 ], and how Tesla invested in a high-quality proprietary charging network to reassure consumers about range anxiety (the Supercharger network) (i.e., by 2019, Tesla owned and operated more than 12,000 Superchargers, marketed exclusively towards Tesla customers [ 35 ]). The critical literature emphasizes Tesla’s status as a flawed manufacturer. In its start-up years, a multi-year string of losing quarters led to questions as to whether Tesla had the financial strength to survive in the capital-intensive manufacturing sector [ 33 ]. The company repeatedly missed targets for rolling out new products [ 36 ]. Tesla suffered production challenges and quality control issues, which contributed to its financial struggles [ 37 ]. During Model 3 production, Tesla heavily relied on automation, which backfired, resulting in protracted delays [ 38 ]. Musk referred to this era as “production hell” [ 30 ]. Flaws in the build quality of Tesla’s vehicles were damaging to Tesla’s overall reputation [ 37 ], but Tesla gradually improved the quality of its manufacturing operations. More recently, Tesla has been criticized for misleading investors [ 39 ], running plants with poor worker safety records and racist cultures [ 36 , 40 ], suppressing unions [ 41 ], and downplaying safety concerns about Autopilot (the company’s partial self-driving technology) [ 42 ]. Drawing from this literature while building upon it, we seek to explain more precisely how Tesla secured its first-mover advantage relative to other pioneers in the U.S., why it took so long for competitors to challenge Tesla’s dominance, and why Tesla’s dominance is beginning to erode. We contend that much of the answer can be found in tangible product comparisons, but changing public policy and changing perceptions of Tesla and its CEO also play a role. 2.4. Literature About New Energy Vehicle Research The term New Energy Vehicle (NEV) was first used by the Chinese government in 2009. It encompasses EVs, PHEVs, and hydrogen-fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). China emerged as a global pioneer of NEVs due to an aggressive industrial policy that leapfrogged the internal combustion engine and established China’s industry as a global leader in NEV technology and marketing. NEVs are relevant to the study of Tesla because Tesla did not emerge in a global vacuum. Tesla’s launch and emergence (2003–2012) occurred at the same time that China’s NEV industry emerged. Eventually, BYD emerged as China’s leading NEV manufacturer, which set in motion global competition between Tesla and BYD. The dynamics of the global competition are beyond the scope of this article. There is, however, burgeoning academic literature on NEVs that helps shed light on factors that influence the success of any EV manufacturer, whether a start-up or established automaker. The NEV literature covers the roles of industrial policies, technological and market advances, global context, and competitive dynamics. The term NEV is uniquely Chinese in its origin, reflecting the nation’s strategy to redefine and prioritize clean, non-ICE vehicles as a core focus of its industrial transformation [ 43 ]. The Chinese NEV industry’s success stems largely from robust government interventions. Policies such as fiscal subsidies, tax incentives, and infrastructure investments have been instrumental in accelerating NEV adoption. Notably, the government provided targeted subsidies to manufacturers and consumers, fostering market demand and promoting innovation [ 44 , 45 ]. Local governments also implemented regional policies that incentivized NEV purchases and penalized traditional ICE vehicles through strict emission standards [ 46 ]. Recent research indicates that the rapid expansion of China’s electric vehicle industry can be attributed to the synergistic impact of substantial central and local government subsidies and the effective strategic maneuvers of leading manufacturers like BYD, underscoring a broader global shift towards cost-effective, environmentally sustainable automotive innovations [ 47 ]. Su and Wan (2024) highlighted how green perceived value (GPV) and green trust encourage NEV purchases, while green perceived risk (GPR) deters adoption. The study underscores the importance of consumer education and trust building for driving sustainable purchasing behaviors [ 48 ]. In the context of addressing the challenges faced by millions of Chinese motorists residing in high-rise apartments without accessible charging infrastructure, the battery-swapping station model offers a practical and innovative solution, providing quick and efficient battery replacements that enhance the usability and adoption of New Energy Vehicles [ 49 ]. Technological advancements in battery performance and charging infrastructure have complemented policy measures. For example, investments in research and development have positioned Chinese firms like BYD and NIO as global leaders in NEV technology [ 50 ]. One study employs an improved particle swarm algorithm to coordinate renewable energy dispatch and EV capacity allocation in regional multi-microgrids, ultimately reducing operational costs, carbon emissions, and fossil fuel dependence [ 51 ]. Key challenges like battery recycling and grid stability are priorities for future research. Despite these successes, challenges such as market fragmentation and interregional competition persist, necessitating enhanced policy coordination and technological collaboration [ 52 ]. 3. Framework: A Three-Period Analysis We have employed a variety of qualitative, semi-quantitative, and statistical methods to shed light on the rise and decline of Tesla’s PEVs in the U.S. We begin by exploring what we call the “Pioneers Period” (2010–2016), when Tesla established its first-mover advantage over other pioneers in the U.S. PEV market. We then explore what we call the “Second-Mover Period” (2017–2019), where Tesla acted to sustain its first-mover advantage while numerous second movers developed products to challenge Tesla’s dominance. Finally, we analyze the “First-Mover Erosion Period” (2020–2024), where Tesla’s first-mover PEV advantage was attenuated by product offerings from other PEV start-ups and established global automakers. 3.1. The Pioneers Period Tesla was not the only vehicle manufacturer to bid for a first-mover advantage in the U.S. PEV market. For 2010 to 2016, we collected data on sales and vehicle characteristics for several other manufacturers who made PEV offerings: Nissan, General Motors (Chevrolet), BMW, Mitsubishi, Ford, and Toyota. We offer a qualitative comparative analysis of the attributes of the Tesla Model S and Model X versus the PEV offerings from the other pioneering manufacturers. We examined attributes related to electric propulsion as well as other attributes that might distinguish the Tesla products. We also collected data on federal and state policies that may have influenced Tesla’s relative commercial success. Although the number of models and years is too small to support quantitative analysis, the qualitative analysis generates some plausible explanations as to why Tesla established a first-mover advantage in this period. 3.2. The Second-Movers Period A first mover’s advantage is not always durable, as competitors can learn from the first mover’s experience and counter with commercially promising alternatives. We gathered data on sales experience and vehicle characteristics for all PEVs sold in the U.S. market in the Second-Movers Period (2017–2020). Since the time required to design, plan, and produce a new model in the U.S. market is typically 4 to 6 years, the second movers had the opportunity to react to the Roadster and the Model S as well as the PEV offerings of other pioneers. Tesla did not stand still in this period, as it offered the more affordable Model 3 to accentuate its advantage in the emergent market for PEVs. Thus, in this period, we compare the sales experience and vehicle characteristics of Tesla’s products (including the Model 3) to other PEV offerings. 3.3. The First-Mover Erosion Period The most recent period, from 2021 to 2024, includes Tesla’s recent success with the Model Y SUV as well as the surge of BEV and PHEV offerings from other start-up and established auto manufacturers. It is also a period of change in federal and state policies towards PEVs and a period when Tesla became a more controversial company because of the decisions and behaviors of CEO Elon Musk. To better understand events that may have impacted the public image of Tesla and Elon Musk, we developed—based on coverage in mass and social media—a detailed timeline of Tesla-related events. We do not attempt to distinguish the image of Tesla from the image of Musk because they are so interwoven. The timeline is presented in Appendix A . 3.4. Tesla’s Product Development Trend Tesla’s ongoing innovation has positioned the company as a leader in electric vehicle technology, with advancements that extend beyond individual models to shape the broader EV market. As shown in Figure 1 , we present Tesla’s new vehicle launch timeline. Over the years, Tesla has introduced significant improvements in battery technology, autonomous driving, software integration, energy efficiency, and charging systems, setting new standards in the automotive industry. One of Tesla’s key contributions has been its leadership in battery innovation. Tesla has consistently improved the energy density and thermal management of its battery packs, allowing for extended driving ranges and enhanced safety. While the company initially relied on commodity lithium-ion cells, it refined its battery pack architecture to optimize performance. Tesla’s patented cooling systems and advancements in the shaping and packaging of battery cells have maximized the number of batteries. These batteries could be housed in a given space and enabled flagship models like the Model S and Model X to achieve ranges exceeding 400 miles per charge, with continued efforts aimed at further increasing range while reducing production costs. In the realm of autonomous driving, Tesla’s introduction of Autopilot in 2014 marked a groundbreaking moment. This suite of features, initially including adaptive cruise control and lane keeping, has evolved into Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability, which seeks to enable fully autonomous operation. Although FSD remains in development, Tesla has continually updated its vehicles with new functionalities, such as Smart Summon, automatic lane changes, and traffic light recognition, leveraging its fleet’s data to improve performance through machine learning. Tesla has also excelled in integrating advanced software into its vehicles, creating a seamless and future-proof user experience. The over-the-air (OTA) update system is a cornerstone of Tesla’s innovation, enabling vehicles to receive software improvements, new features, and even safety recalls without requiring a visit to a service center. This capability distinguishes Tesla from traditional automakers and has set a precedent for how software can enhance vehicle functionality over time. In addition to software and autonomy, Tesla has made strides in energy efficiency and charging infrastructure. The company’s Supercharger network, introduced in 2012, has expanded to provide rapid charging access worldwide, with charging speeds continuously improving to reduce wait times. Tesla’s focus on energy efficiency extends beyond its vehicles to its energy products, such as Powerwall batteries and solar panels, which integrate seamlessly with its EV ecosystem. Tesla’s design philosophy emphasizes performance and practicality, as seen in innovations like dual-motor all-wheel drive systems, which improve traction and handling, and advanced aerodynamic designs that enhance energy efficiency. These advancements are complemented by Tesla’s iterative approach to design and engineering, allowing for continuous improvement without adhering to traditional model–year redesign cycles. By maintaining a strong focus on technological advancement, Tesla has redefined industry expectations for EVs and influenced competitors to adopt similar strategies. From battery performance to autonomous driving and software integration, Tesla’s holistic approach to innovation has not only advanced the capabilities of its vehicles but also accelerated the global transition to sustainable transportation. 4. Evolution in the PEV Market and Popular Model Overview 4.1. The Pioneers Period: 2010–2016 Conventional wisdom is that Tesla’s first-mover advantage in EVs flowed from the company’s formation in 2003 and Elon Musk’s announcement in 2008–2009 that Tesla was developing a mass-market electric car that would sell for less than USD 35,000. CEO Elon Musk posted the strategy for his new company publicly on the company’s website in 2006: “Almost any new technology initially has high unit cost before it can be optimized, and this is no less true for electric cars. The strategy of Tesla is to enter at the high end of the market, where customers are prepared to pay a premium, and then drive down market as fast as possible to higher unit volume and lower price with each successive model” (Tesla, 2006). Tesla has followed this path to some extent but has not yet even attempted to offer an affordable electric car for the mass market. Tesla led with the boutique, six-figure Roadster sports car (2008–2012); then, it offered in 2012 the Tesla Model S (sedan) and in 2015 the Tesla Model X (SUV). The S and X were upscale products aimed at premium and luxury markets. It was not until 2017 and 2020 that Tesla launched the mass-market Model 3 (sedan) and Model Y (crossover), respectively, and, even then, it is a stretch to suggest that those offerings were aimed at the affordable end of the market [ 4 ]. During the Pioneers Period, Tesla’s Model S was challenged in the U.S. by innovative PEV offerings from several competitors. We offer a qualitative account of each manufacturer’s pioneer-stage activities. Nissan–Renault—While Toyota and Honda were first movers with hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and nickel batteries in the early 1990s, Nissan was a pioneer with BEVs and lithium-ion batteries. Indeed, in response to California’s zero-emission vehicle mandate of the 1990s, Nissan was the first vehicle manufacturer to offer a PEV with lithium-ion batteries, when the Altra was offered to selected California fleet buyers. For the next decade, the Nissan–Renault Alliance spent approximately USD 5.8 billion on R&D into electric vehicle technologies [ 1 ]. The CEO of the Alliance, Carlos Ghosn, stunned the global industry in October 2007 when he pledged to bring an “entire lineup” of BEVs to the global market by 2012. He established in 2009 a joint venture with the Japanese electronics giant NEC Corporation to make lithium-ion batteries for BEVs. At the fall 2008 Paris Auto Show, Nissan–Renault unveiled the company’s far-reaching plan for mass-market EVs, including a tiny concept car called the NuVu. For the U.S. market, Nissan led in December 2010 with the all-electric LEAF, a compact car sold a year ahead of Tesla’s Model S. While the Obama administration subsidized Tesla, the administration also subsidized Nissan–Renault, even though the Alliance’s global headquarters were in Yokohama and Paris. In January 2010, the Department of Energy issued a USD 1.45 billion loan guarantee to Nissan North America (DOE, 2024). The loan was to support (1) construction of one of the largest advanced battery manufacturing plants in the United States, (2) construction of an efficient and environmentally friendly paint plant, (3) a retool of its Smyrna, Tennessee, manufacturing facility for assembly of the all-electric LEAF, and (4) development of an electric powertrain manufacturing line for the LEAF within its engine manufacturing facility in Decherd, Tennessee. While the LEAF was innovative and less than half the price of the Model S, it was not in the same league as the Model S, which was introduced soon after the LEAF. The driving range of the LEAF was less than half of that of the S. The Tesla Superchargers provided 170 miles of range after just 30 min of use, while a Nissan LEAF driver would extract 75 to 100 miles of range in the same timeframe using the CHAdeMO fast-charging station [ 53 ]. Furthermore, the air-cooling system in the LEAF did not protect against battery degradation as effectively as the liquid-cooling system in the Model S [ 1 ]. The LEAF is extremely important because it was the largest-selling BEV in the world until it was eventually overtaken by the Tesla Model 3 in 2020. General Motors—Fearing the HEVs offered by Toyota and Honda, GM countered with the Chevrolet Volt, the first mass-market PHEV, though GM marketed it as a “range-extended” BEV. GM first announced the Volt in January 2007 at the North American International Auto Show. In collaboration with battery producer LG Chem of South Korea, GM accelerated the rollout of the Volt in response to Wall Street’s growing interest in Tesla. Sales began in the U.S. in late 2010 and soon thereafter in Europe as the rebadged Opel Ampera. Although the Volt was assembled in Detroit and won the 2011 Green Car of the Year award, it was criticized for its limited electric range and was terminated in 2018 due to disappointing sales. GM pivoted to BEV technology through the Chevrolet Bolt, which was first offered in 2016. BMW—In 2007, BMW launched “Project i”, a long-term program to develop a separate sub-brand of electric vehicles called the i-series. The company started with a two-year trial (2009–2011) of the Mini E in Los Angeles and New York. The Mini E was a British Mini Cooper converted into a BEV. In 2009, BMW formally committed to the new i brand, leading to the launch of the i3 in 2013, a luxury subcompact hatchback and, later, in 2014, the i8 hybrid sports car. The i3 had a carbon-fiber body and an optional range-extending gasoline engine which proved to be more popular in the U.S. than in Europe. Although BMW has had a large manufacturing presence in the U.S. since 1994, the i3 and i8 were assembled only in Germany. They were imported into the U.S. but the volume of U.S. sales was constrained by the popularity of the vehicles in Europe. Mitsubishi—Prior to joining the Nissan–Renault Alliance in 2016, Mitsubishi was a pioneer in electric vehicle technology. The company offered the tiny Mitsubishi Innovative Electric Vehicle (i-MiEV) in collaboration with Japanese battery supplier GS Yuasa. Sales began in Japan in April 2010 and in Europe in October 2010. It was never assembled in the U.S. but, for a brief period, it was imported into the U.S. market. The company followed with the Outlander SUV PHEV in 2017, which ultimately became the best-selling PHEV in the world for an extended period of time. Toyota—In response to California’s zero-emission vehicle mandate, Toyota leased limited numbers of the RAV4 EV with nickel batteries from 1997 to 2003. Through a collaboration with Tesla and Panasonic, Toyota switched to lithium-ion batteries in its 2012 offering of the RAV4 EV, though it produced the vehicle for only three years. The offering ended when Toyota sold its shares in Tesla and terminated its collaboration with Tesla. The conventional hybrid Prius was a global success starting in the 1990s. Toyota followed with the Prius Plug-In Hybrid Concept in 2009 at auto shows in Frankfurt, Tokyo, and Los Angeles. Also called the Prius Prime, the first generation of the vehicle was offered in the U.S., Europe, and Japan from 2012 to 2016, and over 40,000 units were sold in the U.S. The Prime originally had an all-electric range of only 11 miles, but more recent generations have extended the model’s electric range. Most recently, Toyota dropped the name “Prime”, referring instead to the Prius Plug-In Hybrid. Ford—The Ford Focus was the company’s most successful small car, though its sales were better in Europe than the U.S. At the 2009 Frankfurt Auto Show, Ford unveiled the Focus Electric, which was designed by its European engineers but assembled in both Wayne, Michigan, and Germany. It was marketed in 2011 with a respectable horsepower of 134 but a range of only 76 miles. The battery pack was packaged under the liftgate, which reduced cargo space by one third compared to the gasoline version. The Focus Electric never surpassed the 2000-unit annual sales mark in the U.S., and was terminated in 2018. Ford was the first manufacturer to offer a hybrid SUV, the Ford Escape Hybrid (2004–2012). The company followed with the Ford C-Max Hybrid and the C-Max Energi PHEV, which were announced at the 2011 North American International Auto Show. The C-Max Energi came to the U.S. market in October 2012 and had limited production through 2017. Mercedes-Benz—Mercedes-Benz offered the B250e (originally branded the B-Class Electric Drive) in a limited number of states (especially California) where it earned some regulatory compliance credits, starting in 2013–2014. Manufactured in Germany, the B250e was one of the only B-Class models to ever be sold in the U.S. market, as well as being the first Mercedes-Benz vehicle to ever be offered in an electric variant. Hyundai/Kia—Assembled in South Korea, the Kia Soul EV was the Hyundai family’s first EV offering in the U.S. market. It was only offered in a limited number of states, starting in 2013–2014. A second-generation version was offered in 2021. Fiat—The diminutive 500e, assembled in Italy, was offered from 2013 to 2019 in California and Oregon only to earn regulatory compliance credits. The CEO of Fiat/Chrysler lamented that the company lost USD 14,000 for each unit sold [ 54 ]. The offering was revived and upgraded in 2024 and is now marketed nationwide in the U.S. Tesla—How did Tesla capture the first-mover advantage? The year 2012 is significant because it is when the Tesla Model S was released and experienced its first full year of production. Table 1 describes the characteristics of the ten all-electric BEVs offered in the Pioneers Period. Table 2 describes the pioneering PHEVs. Inspection of the tables provides insight into why Tesla won the competition of the pioneers, even though the Model S was priced more than USD 10,000 higher than the next most expensive PEV (the RAV4 EV). Most stunning are the Model S’s advantages in driving range and acceleration capability. It is important to compare these pioneering models from both market and technical perspectives. This comparison highlights the unique contributions of each vehicle to the evolution of the BEV industry. Among these, the Tesla Model S stood out as a groundbreaking innovation, redefining the possibilities of electric propulsion, while competitors such as the Nissan LEAF and Chevrolet Volt targeted different consumer segments with their distinct and more affordable offerings. The Tesla Model S, launched in 2012, revolutionized perceptions of BEVs by blending luxury, performance, and efficiency. It was recognized by MotorTrend as the 2013 “Car of the Year” for its ability to seamlessly combine the agility of a sports car, the elegance of a luxury sedan, and the utility of a midsized SUV. The Model S incorporated a suite of technical innovations, including an all-aluminum body, an AC induction motor positioned between the rear wheels for optimal weight distribution, and a modular lithium-ion battery pack. While using standard cells, the battery pack employed a sophisticated thermal management system featuring a patented serpentine cooling pipe that improved reliability and performance. Beyond its electric propulsion, the Model S introduced features that redefined the automotive experience. Its 17-inch touchscreen consolidated nearly all vehicle controls, with the exception of the hazard lights and glovebox buttons, creating an intuitive and futuristic interface. Over-the-air updates allowed Tesla to deliver new features, fix recalls, and enhance performance without requiring visits to service centers, minimizing inconvenience for owners. This capability was unparalleled at the time and set a new standard for vehicle maintenance and software integration. In terms of market positioning, the Model S emphasized cutting-edge technology over style or comfort. Tesla equipped the car with “Autopilot-ready” hardware, signaling its ambition to lead in autonomous driving technology. Furthermore, the Model S addressed “range anxiety”—a significant barrier to BEV adoption—through its large battery pack, which offered an EPA-certified range of 265 miles, and access to Tesla’s proprietary Supercharger network, enabling rapid long-distance travel. In contrast, competitors such as the Nissan LEAF and Chevrolet Volt approached the market differently. The Nissan LEAF focused on affordability and urban transportation, offering a limited range of approximately 73 miles in its early models. The Chevrolet Volt adopted a range-extended BEV model, using a gasoline engine to extend the range and alleviate concerns about battery capacity. However, while these vehicles provided viable solutions for specific consumer needs, they lacked the comprehensive performance, range, and technological sophistication of the Model S. Inspection of early PHEVs reveals that they were generally more affordable but compromised on all-electric range and acceleration capability. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was particularly critical of PHEVs, considering them a step back from the ideal of all-electric propulsion. The Model S also challenged traditional automotive paradigms with innovations unrelated to its electric drivetrain. Its massive cargo capacity, versatile hatchback design, and optional third-row seating provided unmatched practicality for a luxury sedan. Performance metrics further distinguished it, with 0–60 mph acceleration in just four seconds for the performance variant. Meanwhile, Tesla’s vision extended beyond individual vehicles, aiming to establish a robust ecosystem of charging infrastructure and autonomous capabilities. While the Toyota Prius Plug-In achieved some longevity and commercial success, most early PHEVs struggled in the marketplace, often being short lived compared to Tesla’s enduring impact. The Model S demonstrated that electric vehicles could surpass internal combustion engine vehicles in multiple dimensions, establishing a new benchmark for the industry and accelerating the transition to sustainable transportation. 4.2. Second-Generation PEVs in the U.S. Market, 2017–2020 Second movers did not make much progress against Tesla in the next period because Tesla innovated with powerful new offerings: the mass market Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV. The commercial success of the Model 3 and Model Y counteracted the new PEV offerings from established and start-up vehicle manufacturers. Table 3 and Table 4 provide an inventory of the new BEVs and PHEVs, respectively, offered during this period. Note that the non-Tesla offerings were somewhat successful in closing the gap with Tesla in terms of driving range. They were also quite competitive on price. But Tesla was rapidly building out its proprietary Supercharger network during this period, while the non-Tesla BEV makers had no proprietary charging network. Owners of non-Tesla products were forced to rely on a primitive public charging network that was only beginning to be built outside the west coast and in the northeast. In the construction of Table 3 and Table 4 , we do not repeat the description of offerings that were first made in the Pioneering Period, though some of the pioneering products (e.g., the Nissan LEAF and BMW i3) received significant upgrades in the 2017–2020 period. Space does not enable us to analyze each of the models in Table 3 and Table 4 , so we offer a brief summary of the non-Tesla models that cracked the top ten in U.S. sales volume for BEVs in 2023 [ 55 ]. As a benchmark for comparison, keep in mind that the 2023 sales volumes for the Model Y (#1) and Model 3 (#2) were 394,497 and 220,910, respectively. Chevrolet Bolt—General Motors was the first manufacturer to offer a product that was competitive to both the Model 3 and the Model Y. The Chevrolet Bolt was offered as a subcompact hatchback in 2018 and as an SUV, the Bolt EUV, in 2022. The 62,045-unit sales volume in 2023 (a distant #3 after the Model Y and Model 3) came one year after a disappointing sales volume in 2022 due to battery manufacturing problems. GM halted Bolt production in 2024 but plans to reintroduce the Bolt based on the company’s Ultium battery platform in model year 2026 [ 56 ]. Ford Mustang Mach-E—The #4 selling BEV in 2023 (40,711 unit sales) was the Mustang Mach-E, which combined the acceleration and sporty styling from the Mustang, the practicality and ride height of an SUV, and the efficiency of a PEV. The Mach-E won Car and Driver ’s “EV of the Year” award in 2021. It is produced at Ford’s large assembly complex in Mexico. While the Mach-E does not match Tesla’s products in driving range or performance, it was a big step forward compared to Ford’s previous PEV offerings. Hyundai IONIQ 5—Hyundai is rapidly making a major play globally with PEVs, and its IONIQ 5 became the #6 selling BEV (33,918 units sold) in the U.S. market in 2023. Winner of Car and Driver ’s 2022 Car of the Year award, the IONIQ 5 is the first of Hyundai’s new sub-brand of electrified vehicles and will soon be assembled at a new facility in the United States. The period also witnessed a proliferation of low-volume PHEV offerings from non-Tesla manufacturers. A PHEV offering is appealing to manufacturers who do not have access to a proprietary charging network and who know consumers have doubts about the reliability of the current public charging stations. Measured by 2023 sales volume, the most successful of the PHEVs were offered by Stellantis, Toyota, and BMW. Overall, though, the PHEVs accounted for only about 20% of the U.S. PEV market in 2023 [ 57 ]. 4.3. The First-Mover Erosion Period: 2021–2024 Tesla’s dominance in the U.S. plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) market began to show signs of decline during the 2023–2024 period. In simple terms, while a variety of new non-Tesla models emerged, Tesla did not introduce any new offerings beyond the high-priced and uniquely designed Cybertruck. Moreover, Tesla’s four flagship models—the Model X, Model S, Model 3, and Model Y—saw only incremental updates rather than significant redesigns. This analysis begins by cataloging the new non-Tesla models entering the market period and then explores a new dimension of technological competition arising in this period: autonomous driving capabilities. A review of Table 5 and Table 6 reveals a diverse range of non-Tesla offerings across various size classes and price points. Both established automakers and newer entrants, such as Rivian and Lucid, have assumed competitive roles in this evolving market. While Tesla has historically led in terms of driving range, recent models from competitors have advanced enough in range to minimize the significance of Tesla’s advantage. Although PHEVs remain a smaller segment of the market, they have made notable progress in extending their all-electric driving ranges compared to earlier models. Furthermore, many of these non-Tesla offerings have made strides in integrating advanced technological features once unique to Tesla, such as large infotainment screens, regular over-the-air software updates, and intuitive user interfaces. These improvements indicate that the gap in technological appeal is narrowing, as new models from competing manufacturers increasingly emulate the distinctive digital experience and connectivity that have set Tesla apart in the past. Volkswagen ID.4—The #5 selling BEV in 2023 (37,789 units sold) was the ID.4. Elected “World Car of the Year” in 2021, it is assembled in Germany, China, and Chattanooga, Tennessee. VW took direct aim at the Tesla Model Y in the global SUV market. While the ID.4 rolled out with advantages in price, comfort, and cabin quality, the Model Y retained advantages in driving dynamics, acceleration time, cargo space, passenger seating capacity, and predicted reliability [ 58 ]. Rivian R1S—The first start-up Tesla competitor to crack the top ten was Rivian with its R1S, a seven-passenger SUV that ranked #7 in U.S. sales among BEVs in 2023 (24,783). It is produced in Normal, Illinois. Ford F-150 Lightning—Ford was the first established manufacturer to offer an all-electric pickup truck, the F-150 Lightning. It ranked #8 in U.S. sales among BEVs in 2023 (24,165 units sold). BMW i4—Ranked #10 in U.S. BEV sales in 2023 (22,853 units sold) was BMW’s i4, a compact executive sedan made in Germany for global distribution. This period also witnessed a surge of interest in electric pickup trucks—a new frontier in the EV market. Rivian’s R1T and Ford’s F-150 Lightning garnered widespread attention for their capabilities and range, capturing the interest of truck enthusiasts looking to transition to electric options. While Tesla’s highly anticipated Cybertruck generated significant pre-order interest, production delays and its unconventional design led some prospective buyers to explore the more readily available offerings from Rivian and Ford. Nonetheless, Tesla’s Cybertruck has provided a new source of sales volume, offsetting the loss in sales volumes for Tesla’s other products. The growing presence of electric trucks in the U.S. market diversified consumer options and signaled the expansion of EV choices beyond traditional sedan and SUV models. Alongside the influx of new models, a price war unfolded within the EV market, further intensifying competition. In 2022, Tesla initiated a significant price reduction for its popular Model Y, aiming to attract a broader range of customers and maintain its market share against the rising competition. This price drop forced other EV manufacturers to re-evaluate their pricing strategies. As prices decreased across the market, the shift heightened consumer interest and made electric vehicles a more viable option for cost-conscious buyers, accelerating the EV adoption rate in the U.S. In recent years, consumers have been showing a growing interest in automation, seeing it as a valuable addition that enhances both convenience and safety. Many manufacturers are working to narrow the gap with Tesla in areas such as large infotainment screens, over-the-air software updates, and self-driving capabilities. Among these features, automation stands out as a defining factor that distinguishes advanced PEVs—not only from conventional vehicles but also from other electric models. As consumer expectations for automation rise, automakers are responding by advancing beyond basic driver assistance features, like parking aids and lane keeping, to increasingly sophisticated levels of autonomous driving [ 59 ]. This evolution reflects a shift in consumer demand; drivers are not only looking for vehicles that perform well on traditional metrics like range and performance but are also prioritizing features that allow for a hands-free driving experience in certain conditions. As this trend continues, the level of automation in PEVs is expected to become a major competitive factor, shaping consumer choices and driving further innovation within the industry [ 60 ]. Self-driving technology is classified by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) across levels, from Level 0 (no automation) to Level 5 (full autonomy). Today, most EVs offer Level 2 automation, which supports functions such as adaptive cruise control and lane keeping but requires drivers to stay vigilant and ready to intervene. Some manufacturers, like Tesla and Mercedes-Benz, are moving closer to Level 3 automation, which allows hands-free driving in specific conditions, such as in traffic on certain highways. Tesla, in particular, maintains a competitive edge in this area. Its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) systems, though still considered Level 2+, are the closest on the market to achieving Level 4 or even Level 5 autonomy, positioning Tesla as a leader in self-driving technology. For example, Mercedes-Benz’s EQB and EQE SUV models offer Level 2 driver assistance with features like adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, and, in some regions, automatic lane changing. The EQE SUV takes this further with Mercedes’ “DRIVE PILOT”, a Level 3 system certified in states like California and Nevada, which supports hands-off driving in heavy traffic at speeds below 40 mph. Nissan’s Ariya and Rivian’s R1S also offer Level 2 autonomy, featuring systems like ProPILOT Assist and Driver+ for highway driving assistance, though both require driver supervision. Subaru’s Solterra includes similar capabilities through EyeSight Driver Assist Technology, supporting adaptive cruise control and lane keeping. Meanwhile, Lucid’s DreamDrive Pro system, available in its Air model, offers Level 2+ capabilities, supporting hands-free highway driving with features like adaptive cruise control and lane centering. Yet, despite these advancements, Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD remain unmatched in their depth of functionality, allowing for extensive hands-free driving on highways and a clear trajectory towards higher levels of autonomy. Notably, however, while self-driving capabilities are gaining attention, consumer priorities often lie in automated safety features over full autonomy [ 61 ]. Functions like adaptive cruise control, emergency braking, and lane keeping remain critical differentiators, as they enhance driving safety without requiring full driver disengagement. As the race toward higher levels of autonomy progresses, automated safety remains central, shaping how the next generation of PEVs is perceived and how consumers approach transportation choices. 5. Modeling and Empirical Results 5.1. Hypothesis Building on the insights about consumer preferences and market competition from the literature reviews ( Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 ), first, we employ a high-dimensional fixed-effects regression model to examine the following hypotheses: H1 Income and Consumer Preference: Households with higher income levels exhibit a stronger preference for Tesla vehicles in their electric vehicle (EV) choices. H2 Market Competition: An increase in the number of competitors in the U.S. EV market will negatively impact Tesla’s market share. H3 Federal and State Subsidies and Tax Credits: Federal and state-level subsidies specific to Tesla will positively influence its market share. Conversely, higher tax credits for Tesla’s competitors are expected to negatively affect Tesla’s market share. H4 Charging Infrastructure: A higher proportion of Tesla supercharging stations compared to all publicly available charging stations will positively influence Tesla’s market share. H5 Brand and CEO Impact: Tesla’s brand reputation and the public image of its CEO, Elon Musk, are positively correlated with Tesla’s market share. H6 Supply-Side Constraints: Supply-side constraints faced by Tesla will negatively impact its market share, while similar constraints faced by its main competitors will benefit Tesla’s market share. In the second part of our empirical analysis, we employ a heterogeneous effects framework with an interaction model to explore the unequal effects of specific factors, including tax credits and an innovative measure—the Tesla–Musk Image Score. This novel index about Tesla and its CEO’s public reputation and image, developed through a detailed review of 20 years of nationwide news and social impact reviews, captures the public perception of Tesla and its CEO. Our additional hypotheses are as follows: H7 Tax Credit Heterogeneity: Tax credits are more effective in counties with lower initial preferences for Tesla. H8 Tesla–Musk Image Score Heterogeneity: The Tesla–Musk Image Score has a greater influence in counties with higher initial preferences for Tesla. These hypotheses aim to provide a broad understanding of the key drivers of Tesla’s market performance and the potential variations in these effects across different contexts and regions. 5.2. Data We gathered electric vehicle registration data from 17 states—California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey, Washington, North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia, Tennessee, Vermont, Maine, Wisconsin, Montana, Minnesota, Colorado, and Connecticut—covering the period from 2018 to 2024. This dataset includes 8,920,214 BEVs and 4,867,962 PHEVs, making up 64.69% and 35.31% of the total plug-in vehicle market, respectively. Among registrations across these 17 states, we identified the top six models for both BEVs and PHEVs from 2018 to the present, as presented in Table 7 . In the BEV market, the concentration is notable, with the top 10 BEV models comprising 84.53% of total U.S. BEV sales. The top three Tesla models—the Model 3, Model Y, and Model S—account for over 52.32% of the BEV market, with the Model 3 leading at 26.11% (“Model 3 is leading at 26.11%” may appear inconsistent with Table 7. This difference arises because the text reflects the average from all data between 2018 and 2024, whereas Table 7 does not include 2024 data due to missing figures from some states). In contrast, the PHEV market is somewhat less concentrated, with the top 10 models representing 69.22% of the PHEV market, led by the Toyota Prius Prime with a 18.60% share. 5.3. Descriptive Evidence About Trends in Tesla’s Market Share We now analyze Tesla’s market share trends in the United States. In the map ( Figure 2 a), we present the state-level average trend of Tesla’s share among BEVs from 2020 to 2023. This timeframe was chosen as most states have complete data starting in 2020, extending through 2023. Although Tesla does not directly report U.S. sales figures, the EV Hub data provide valuable insights into Tesla’s market representation across states with varying characteristics, economic levels, and political preferences. The first map illustrates the state-level average Tesla share, where the colors represent changes relative to each state’s baseline levels in 2020. Blue indicates an increase in Tesla’s share, while orange shows a decrease. Notably, as reported in recent news about Tesla’s declining U.S. market share, no state shows an average increase; all states exhibit a decline. In the map ( Figure 2 b) below, we present a more granular analysis by mapping Tesla’s market share trend at the county level. This allows us to observe localized patterns, with some counties showing increases in Tesla’s share. However, the overall trend is downward in a majority of counties. To further extend the analysis, we plot the trends through 2024. However, as some states’ department of motor vehicles report registration data to EV Hub with delays, the tradeoff is a reduction in available states. In extending the analysis to 2024, we observe a continuation of the general trend of Tesla’s market share decline across the United States. The map ( Figure 3 a) reveals that the magnitude of Tesla’s share decrease has further intensified in certain states, particularly in regions with previously high adoption rates such as California. States like Tennessee also show continued declines, reinforcing the broader trend observed in earlier years. The county-level map for 2024 ( Figure 3 b) provides a more granular view of these shifts. Similar to the trends from 2020–2023, some counties show slight increases in Tesla’s share, particularly in regions with newer infrastructure or stronger economic growth. However, the overall pattern remains dominated by decreases, reflecting the challenges Tesla faces in maintaining its dominance in the evolving U.S. electric vehicle market. 5.4. Empirical Model Settings In this section, a high-dimensional fixed-effects regression model is used to analyze Tesla’s market share among all battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales in the U.S. Our analysis is based on county–quarter-level new registration data, which capture vehicle sales and, in some cases, relocations where residents first register their used vehicles in a new state. To ensure accuracy in isolating new vehicle registrations, we restrict the analysis to cases where the gap between the car’s model year and the registration year is minimal (<1 year). This approach allows us to more precisely examine the various factors that may influence Tesla’s market share of new vehicles. TeslaShare i t = α + β 1 · Ln ( Household Median Income ) i t + β 2 · Number of Available Models i t + β 3 · Tesla Tax Credit t + β 4 · Weighted Competitor Tax Credit t + β 5 · Supercharge Ratio i t + β 6 · Tesla & Musk Image Score t + β 7 · Tesla Supply Constraints i t + β 8 · Competitor Supply Constraints i t + γ y e a r + δ s t a t e + ϵ i t (1) In Equation ( 1 ), the dependent variable represents Tesla’s market share in quarter t for county i . The independent variables encompass a variety of economic, market, and supply-side factors that potentially influence Tesla’s performance in the BEV market. The independent variables are discussed below. One of the key factors we account for is consumer buying power, represented by time-variant county-level median income. This variable serves as a proxy for the consumer’s ability to pay, which should influence consumer decisions about whether to purchase a PEV. Areas with higher median income are expected to have greater purchasing power, making them more inclined toward adopting premium PEVs such as the Tesla models. In addition, the model includes a variable for consumer choice diversity, which measures the number of available BEV models in each state in each year. The recent growth in the value of this variable reflects the growing competition in the BEV market, as more automakers have introduced new BEV models that potentially challenge Tesla’s dominance. A higher number of available models suggests more competition, which should negatively affect Tesla’s market share. Tax credits may play a significant role in influencing BEV sales [ 62 , 63 ], and this is captured by two tax credit variables in the model. First, we include a measure for Tesla’s own federal tax credit, which fluctuated during the analysis period. Initially, Tesla received a USD 7500 federal tax credit before 2018, which was gradually phased out—reduced to USD 3750 in the first half of 2019, further down to USD 1875 in the second half of 2019, and completely eliminated from 2020 to 2022. However, the tax credit was reinstated in 2023 at the full USD 7500 amount, providing a renewed boost to Tesla’s sales. Tesla is in a good position to capture the full credit because it assembles its vehicles in the U.S. and has invested in a substantial U.S.-based supply chain. Additionally, we account for competitor tax credits, which represent the weighted average of tax incentives available to Tesla’s main competitors—Nissan, Chevrolet, and Ford—during the same periods. These weights are based on their relative market shares. Charging infrastructure plays a critical role in Tesla’s success, with the widespread availability of Tesla Supercharger stations being a significant competitive advantage. To quantify this, we use a metric called the Supercharge Station Ratio, which represents the proportion of Tesla Supercharger stations to the total number of Tesla and public FastDC (level 3) charging stations in each county. This measure captures Tesla’s relative charging accessibility in comparison to other fast-charging options. According to the J.D. Power Electric Vehicle Experience (EVX) Ownership Study, the availability and reliability of charging infrastructure are key factors in EV owner satisfaction. Tesla’s extensive Supercharger network not only addresses range anxiety but also enhances user convenience, setting it apart from competitors who rely on public charging networks [ 64 ]. We introduce a novel variable in our model to capture the public image of Tesla and Elon Musk, which could influence consumer preference and purchase behaviors. We build the index by reviewing nearly 20 years of national news about Tesla in the United States. For example, recent reports indicate that Elon Musk’s personal political views have impacted Tesla sales among certain demographics [ 65 , 66 ]. To examine this potential influence, we gather and analyze all relevant news related to Tesla’s history (2003–2024), drawing from nationwide print media sources, primarily The Wall Street Journal , The New York Times , and other major publications. Our team assessed each event’s impact on consumer sentiment by conducting a survey in which each team member rated events as positive (1), negative/controversial (−1), or neutral (0), as detailed in Appendix A . This variable is quantified through an accumulated signal score, where positive events—such as successful product launches or favorable media coverage—are scored as +1, negative events or controversies as −1, and neutral events as 0. These scores are accumulated over a rolling three-year period, providing a unique metric to reflect how public perceptions of Tesla and its CEO might influence short-term sales and market performance. We did not attempt to separate attitudes toward Tesla from attitudes toward Elon Musk, assuming they are interwoven. While categorizing events involves some subjectivity, each co-author coded the events independently, and any discrepancies were resolved through discussion to reach a consensus. Supply constraints can also influence Tesla’s market share. According to industry reports and statements from Elon Musk in June 2022, Tesla faced significant supply constraints, although the specific timing and details were not fully disclosed. By analyzing Tesla’s production and delivery trends, we can observe a clear divergence between the supply side (production) and the demand side (deliveries), particularly from Q4 2021 to Q3 2022, as illustrated in Figure 4 . During this period, Tesla’s production was unable to keep pace with the growing consumer demand, which likely stemmed from a range of supply chain disruptions (e.g., shortages of critical components such as semiconductors, delays in manufacturing processes, and logistical challenges exacerbated by global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic). The semiconductor shortage, in particular, severely impacted Tesla’s ability to maintain its usual production output. Moreover, international shipping delays further compounded these issues, as some of Tesla’s supply chains span multiple countries. This period of supply constraints is important for understanding fluctuations in Tesla’s market share, and we include this variable in our model to capture its impact on Tesla’s performance. We create a Tesla supply constraints dummy, which equals 1 during the period from Q4 2021 to Q3 2022. Additionally, competitor supply constraints are also factored into our model. General Motors (GM), for example, faced significant disruptions when it shut down its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan in August 2021 due to a battery recall for its Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle. This recall was initially triggered by a 2020 Bolt catching fire in California, leading GM to expand the recall in August 2021 to cover all 140,000 units delivered. The temporary closure of GM’s plant significantly affected the availability of Chevrolet Bolt vehicles in the market, reducing competition for Tesla during this period. We create a competitor supply constraints dummy, which equals 1 during the period from Q3 2021 to Q4 2021. By incorporating both Tesla’s and its competitors’ supply constraints into our model, we account for how external factors like factory shutdowns, recalls, and supply shortages have influenced Tesla’s market share by either limiting Tesla’s ability to meet demand or reducing competition from other EV manufacturers. Finally, the model controls for year-specific fixed effects to account for time-related factors that might affect Tesla’s market share across all counties, as well as state-specific fixed effects such as baseline differences in Tesla’s popularity and state-specific incentives to purchase plug-in vehicles. These fixed effects help isolate the influence of the independent variables by controlling for general trends and unobserved factors at the state and year levels. The error term in the model represents any remaining unobserved influences on Tesla’s market share in each county and quarter. 5.5. Empirical Results The regression results from column (4) provide important insights into the factors influencing Tesla’s market share in the U.S. BEV market. The results for each variable are presented in Table 8 . In column (4), with both state and year fixed effects included, the coefficient for log median income is positive (0.0316) and highly significant at the 1% level. This result confirms that higher-income counties tend to have a larger share of Tesla sales. This aligns with our expectations in Hypothesis 1, as Tesla vehicles are premium products, and higher income levels allow consumers to more readily afford them. In contrast, the number of available BEV models shows a negative coefficient (−0.00233) and is also highly significant at the 1% level. This indicates that increased competition from other BEV manufacturers erodes Tesla’s market share. As more BEV models are introduced into the market, consumers have more choices, which diverts sales away from Tesla. This finding aligns well with the expectations of Hypothesis 2 about market competition, reinforcing the notion that competition is intensifying in the BEV market and is becoming a significant factor constraining Tesla’s market share. The positive and significant coefficient for Tesla’s tax credits (1.83 × 10 − 5 ) suggests that federal government incentives continue to play an important role in Tesla’s success. The availability of tax credits reduces the effective cost of Tesla vehicles for consumers, boosting demand. This result is aligned with Hypothesis 3, given that federal incentives have historically helped support the adoption of electric vehicles by making them more financially accessible. Interestingly, the competitor tax credit variable is not significant, with a negative coefficient (−4.42 × 10 − 6 ). While we would expect competitor tax credits to impact Tesla’s market share negatively, the lack of significance suggests that other factors may be more influential in shaping consumer preferences than competitor credits. Overall, the 2023 policy changes on credits appear to have attenuated Tesla’s recent decline in BEV share. The Supercharge Station Ratio, with a positive coefficient of 0.0186 and significance at the 1% level, underscores the importance of Tesla’s proprietary charging network and is aligned with Hypothesis 4 about infrastructure. Tesla’s Supercharger stations provide a unique advantage over public FastDC stations, contributing to Tesla’s strong market position. The convenience and accessibility of charging infrastructure are critical factors for many consumers when they decide to purchase a BEV, and Tesla’s continued investment in its Supercharger network has paid off by strengthening its market share. The Tesla–Musk Image Score, an innovative factor built for the paper, also with a positive coefficient of 0.00335 and significant at the 5% level, suggests that public perception of Tesla and its CEO play a meaningful role in shaping Tesla’s market performance, which is aligned with Hypothesis 5. Positive (negative) media events about the brand and Elon Musk appear to influence consumer behavior, translating into higher (lower) sales and market share. This confirms our hypothesis that Tesla’s market success is closely tied to its brand image and the personal reputation of its high-profile CEO. One surprising result is the positive coefficient for Tesla’s supply constraints (0.0185), which is highly significant at the 1% level and is misaligned with the expectation in Hypothesis 6. Typically, supply constraints are expected to negatively impact sales, as the inability to meet demand would limit market share. However, this positive coefficient suggests that, despite supply issues, Tesla remained strong enough to boost its market share. It is possible that, during these periods, competitors faced even more severe supply issues (i.e., Tesla was less reliant on foreign suppliers), or Tesla’s brand appeal was strong enough to sustain consumer interest despite the constrained supply. Another possible explanation for this surprising result is that Tesla’s supply constraints occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, a time when global logistics were severely disrupted and all automakers were potentially affected by widespread supply chain challenges. The positive coefficient could indicate that, even in the face of such constraints, Tesla may have had superior supply chain management compared to its competitors. Tesla’s ability to navigate these challenges more effectively could have allowed it to continue delivering vehicles when other automakers were facing even greater production halts. The issue merits further investigation with a detailed supply chain model. Finally, the coefficient for competitor supply constraints (0.0121) is positive but not statistically significant. While we expected that supply chain disruptions for competitors would benefit Tesla, the lack of significance suggests that these constraints did not meaningfully affect Tesla’s market share during the observed periods. This might indicate that supply chain disruptions were widespread across the industry, neutralizing any specific advantage Tesla could have gained from competitor shortages. 5.6. Regional Heterogeneity in the Effects of Tax Credits and Elon Musk’s Image on Tesla’s Market Share Tesla has recently experienced a decline in its U.S. market share, as shown in the descriptive evidence section before, raising questions about how various factors, such as financial incentives and brand perception, influence its competitiveness. Tax credits remain a key policy instrument to promote the adoption of electric vehicles, while Tesla’s reputation, heavily shaped by Elon Musk’s public image, continues to play a significant role in consumer decisions. However, the impacts of these factors may not be uniform across regions. Understanding these heterogeneous effects is essential for designing more effective policies and strategies to mitigate Tesla’s market share decline and maintain its leadership in the electric vehicle sector. To analyze these dynamics, we classify counties into two groups based on whether their Tesla market share is above or below the state-level median, calculated annually. Counties where Tesla’s market share exceeds the state median are classified as “more Tesla preferred”, while those below the median are considered “less Tesla preferred”. This distinction allows us to explore how the effectiveness of tax credits and Elon Musk’s image score varies across regions with differing levels of Tesla adoption. Using a heterogeneous effects framework with the interaction model, we estimate the interactions between these factors and regional preferences. 5.6.1. Tax Credit Heterogeneous Impact In the first model, we focus on the impact of tax credits, incorporating an interaction term between the tax credit and the county preference group. In Equation ( 2 ), the dependent variable represents Tesla’s market share in quarter t for county i . The regression model is specified as follows: TeslaShare i t = α + β 1 · Group Preference i t + β 2 · Tax Credit i t + β 3 · Group Preference × Tax Credit i t + β 4 · Ln ( Income ) i t + β 5 · Number of BEV Models i t + β 6 · Weighted Competitor Tax Credit i t + β 7 · Supercharge Ratio i t + β 8 · Tesla & Musk Image Score t + β 9 · Supply Constraints i t + β 10 · Competitor Supply Constraints i t + γ y e a r + δ s t a t e + ϵ i t (2) The regression results in Table 9 reveal important insights into the varying impact of Tesla-specific tax credits across counties with different levels of Tesla adoption. The positive and significant coefficient for the more-Tesla-preferred group dummy indicates that counties with higher baseline Tesla market share (“more-Tesla-preferred” counties) exhibit a consistently stronger presence, likely driven by network effects, brand loyalty, and infrastructure availability. The positive coefficient for Tesla’s tax credits demonstrates that financial incentives are an effective tool for boosting Tesla’s market share overall, albeit with a modest effect size, consistent with the results in Table 8 . Our key interest here is the interaction term, as it highlights how tax credits yield diminishing returns in “more-Tesla-preferred” counties but have a larger impact in “less-Tesla-preferred” counties, where adoption remains lower. The finding is aligned with Hypothesis 7. This suggests that financial incentives are most effective in overcoming initial barriers to adoption in regions that are more price sensitive or less familiar with Tesla vehicles. By capturing this differential effect, the interaction term emphasizes the heterogeneous nature of financial incentives, providing a nuanced understanding of where tax credits are most impactful. From a policy perspective, these findings suggest that tax credits should be strategically targeted to “less-Tesla-preferred” counties to maximize their effectiveness and reduce regional disparities in electric vehicle adoption. For Tesla, this indicates the importance of tailoring strategies: leveraging financial incentives to expand its market share in low-adoption regions while focusing on enhancing infrastructure and reinforcing brand loyalty in areas where Tesla already leads. The interaction term thus provides insights into how regional preferences mediate the effectiveness of tax credits, offering actionable pathways to address Tesla’s recent decline in U.S. market share. 5.6.2. Tesla–Musk Image Score Heterogeneous Impact In the second model, we investigate the role of Elon Musk’s public image, incorporating an interaction term between the county preference group and Tesla’s three-year Elon Musk Image Score. In the regression Equation ( 3 ), the dependent variable represents Tesla’s market share in quarter t for county i . The model examines how the effect of Elon Musk’s image varies between counties with higher and lower baseline Tesla adoption levels. The regression model is specified as follows: TeslaShare i t = α + β 1 · Group Preference i t + β 2 · Image Score i t + β 3 · Group Preference × Image Score i t + β 4 · Ln ( Income ) i t + β 5 · Number of BEV Models i t + β 6 · Tax Credit i t + β 7 · Weighted Competitor Tax Credit i t + β 8 · Supercharge Ratio i t + β 9 · Supply Constraints i t + β 10 · Competitor Supply Constraints i t + γ y e a r + δ s t a t e + ϵ i t (3) Understanding the coefficient β 3 in Table 10 for the interaction term is critical, as it reveals how the effectiveness of Musk’s image varies by regional preferences. In “more-Tesla-preferred” counties, consumers may already align with Tesla’s brand values and are therefore more influenced by Tesla and Musk’s reputation. In contrast, in “less-Tesla-preferred” counties, the role of Elon Musk’s image appears weaker, as other barriers, such as affordability or limited infrastructure, may outweigh the influence of his public persona. These findings are aligned with expectations from Hypothesis 8 and carry important implications. Policymakers and Tesla should consider the regional context when designing strategies. For “more-Tesla-preferred” counties, Tesla could focus on leveraging Tesla company and Elon Musk’s public image to strengthen its market position and maintain consumer loyalty. However, in “less-Tesla-preferred” counties, Tesla should prioritize addressing structural barriers, such as affordability and infrastructure, as Musk’s image alone may not sufficiently influence adoption in these regions. The interaction term thus highlights the importance of tailoring strategies to the regional dynamics of Tesla adoption, offering actionable insights to address the company’s recent decline in U.S. market share. 6. Discussion We begin with a discussion of the limitations of our investigation. Then, we turn to a discussion of some interesting implications of our results. There are limitations of our data and analysis. First, we have omitted consideration of conventional hybrid electric vehicles, whose sales are now growing more rapidly in the U.S. (and in California) than sales of EVs. The conventional hybrid, championed by Toyota and Honda, is now being offered more aggressively by other manufacturers (e.g., Ford) and will not go away unless regulators force its demise or battery prices fall so dramatically that a vehicle with two propulsion systems cannot be sustained economically. Second, we have not undertaken a segmented analysis of the U.S. vehicle market, looking separately at trends in pickup trucks, large SUVs, small SUVs, large cars, and small cars. A fruitful direction for future research would be to dig into the trends in these segments, and explore the opportunities for Tesla and non-Tesla offerings of EVs. Finally, it would be fruitful to generate public perceptions data on Tesla/Musk and other manufacturers/CEOs to enrich the rough reputational surrogate used in our analysis. Despite these limitations, our results do have some interesting implications for how Tesla and its competitors might position themselves in the future. We advance these implications as hypotheses for further study, since our findings only suggest possibilities. Tesla’s market shares are likely to continue to decline as the number of new PEVs from start-up and established automakers proliferate. Moreover, Tesla has not recently been highly nimble in offering new products or redesigning its existing models. Unless Tesla engages in continued product innovation, its share of the PEV market will gradually be lost to competitors. The next decade presents a strategic dilemma for the future of Tesla in the auto sector. Since PEVs now account for only about 10% of new vehicle sales in the U.S., and since regulatory forces may move the market to 50–100% EVs by 2035–2040, Tesla needs to decide whether it will participate in the rapid commercialization process that will occur in the more affordable end of the U.S. vehicle market. So far, Tesla has stayed primarily in the premium and luxury markets. Historically, the vehicle manufacturers that have performed best in the high-volume, low-margin affordable segment (e.g., Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Suzuki) have been different from the vehicle manufacturers and brands that generate most of their revenue and profit from the premium and luxury offerings (e.g., BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, Cadillac, Lincoln, Infiniti). It will not be easy for Tesla to compete with affordable PEVs from a company like Hyundai/Kia, which is already selling appealing PEVs at prices below where the Model 3 and Y have historically been priced. The fact that Tesla is now willing to slow the growth of its Supercharger network and provide its competitors access to its Superchargers is a possible indication that Tesla will not try to dominate the market for PEVs priced between USD 20,000 and USD 35,000 (Peterson, 2024; Morris, Alim, Campbell, 2024). If Tesla was serious about dominating the affordable end of the market, it seems unlikely that they would have given away the competitive advantage of its proprietary Supercharger network, even though it has gained some public subsidies for its Supercharger network. A better strategy for Tesla may be to remain an innovative premium vehicle producer by leading the U.S. market to its next revolution: autonomous vehicle technology. News reports suggest that Tesla executives may give more priority to leading on autonomous vehicles (e.g., upgrades to Autopilot and robotaxis) than rolling out a USD 25,000 BEV for retail distribution [ 67 ]. This strategy plays better to Tesla’s strengths as a technology innovator. Our results suggest even more sobering challenges for Tesla’s competitors, as no single non-Tesla product has been able to approach the sales volume of the Model Y or Model 3. While non-Tesla offerings, as a whole, will gradually chip away at Tesla’s share of the PEV market, it may be difficult for any single non-Tesla PEV model to achieve the high volume, high plant utilization, and economies of scale that are necessary for strong profitability in this sector. If a manufacturer can achieve high sales volumes in profitable niche markets (e.g., SUVs or pickup trucks), possibly with PHEV offerings, a profitable path forward may be feasible for the next decade. If not, one should expect some commercial casualties (i.e., termination of specific PEV models, closure of some PEV plants in the U.S., and even bankruptcies among some of the non-Tesla start-ups and established U.S. automakers) over the next decade.
