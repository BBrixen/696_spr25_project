Fiona Flynn 5 years ago Share Speculation was rife yesterday over the release date of the much-anticipated third season of 'The Crown' due to a since-deleted article on EW which cited a release date of November 17th for the third season of 'The Crown'. Well, Netflix has now confirmed it and given a teaser trailer to go with 'The Crown' season 3's date announcement.

It's very short in fairness, but we'll take it. ﻿ It will have been almost two years since the last outing of the show on Netflix, with the royal drama completely recasting as the story moves on to later in Queen Elizabeth's reign. As we said, Colman will take the lead, while Tobias Menzies plays Prince Philip and Helena Bonham Carter takes on the role of Princess Margaret. Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret in 'The Crown' Other castings include Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher, Emerald Fennell as Camilla Parker Bowles and Josh O'Connor as Prince Charles. Emma Corrin has been cast as Princess Diana but she won't make an appearance until season 4 in 2020.
