Members Online • RedPyramidScheme Throwback: Guillermo Del Toro discusses what SILENT HILLS would have been Discussion A couple of interviews that I dug up a few days ago that I decided to share because they were interesting. Let's be real: this game is never happening, but it's still fascinating to think about what could have been with Guillermo Del Toro, Junji Ito, and a crazy auteur game developer collaborating on a Silent Hill game. According to Del Toro: We had a great experience and had great story sessions with hundreds upon hundreds of designs. Some of the stuff that we were designing for Silent Hills I’ve seen in games that came after, like The Last of Us , which makes me think we were not wrong, we were going in the right direction . The thing with Kojima and Silent Hills is that I thought we would do a really remarkable game and really go for the jugular . We were hoping to actually create some sort of panic with some of the devices we were talking about and it is really a shame that it’s not happening. When you ask about how things operate, that makes no f#cking sense at all that that game is not happening. https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3364524/interview-guillermo-del-toro-on-serenading-crews-silent-hills-and-crimson-peak/ What we wanted to do with the game – and we were very much in agreement on this – was to take the technology and make it as cutting-edge as we could in creating terror in the house. The idea was very, very atmosphere-drenched. But what made Silent Hill so great was that you had the atmosphere but then you a pay-off with a very active, very intense series of moments . We wanted to do some stuff that I’m pretty sure – just in case it ever comes back, which honestly I would love for somebody to change their mind and we can do it – but in case it comes back there was some stuff that was very new, and I wouldn’t want to spoil it . https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/15/guillermo-del-toro-laments-what-silent-hills-couldve-been Read more New to Reddit?
