Salas began in fine form by sinking birdies over the first two holes, before a bogey on the par-three sixth appeared to slow her progress. The 30-year-old's response was a brilliant hat-trick of birdies to bridge the front and back nines. While Sala looked in control, Ko wasn't backing down. She sunk birdies on three of the first four holes on the back nine. Ko was bogey-free over 13 holes, an efficient run good enough to keep her in touch at the top: Among those keeping the pressure on the joint-leaders was Morgan Pressel. She only managed a single birdie over the front nine, but things improved on the second half of the course. Pressel managed an eagle on the par-five 11th, before birdies at the 13th and 14th: Things were becoming congested at the business end of the leaderboard, but Salas seized the chance to separate herself from the pack at the par-five 15th. Her deft putt to complete birdie once again gave the American sole ownership of first place: Shibuno was also making her move after she recovered from a double bogey on the par-four third. She made an eagle at the eighth, before sinking a trio of birdies over the four holes of the back nine. Ko and Shibuno were now locked in a tie for second, but the latter soon joined Salas at the top thanks to this birdie at the 15th: Salas' response was to close out with pars over the last three holes. However, she missed a birdie putt on the 18th that would have put her out of sight. The birdie that was meant to be gave Shibuno the opportunity, but she couldn't take it. Instead, the 20-year-old wasted a birdie putt and settled for par on the 17th. Shibuno knew a birdie on the 18th would give her the title and made a great start to completing the hole: It left her with a straightforward putt to claim the championship after a superb 31-shot performance over the back nine. 04:50 NBA Comps for Top Bigs üë• TOP NEWS Ranking Top 10 Free Agents Post-Draft Bleacher Report 18h WWE NXT Results and Grades ‚úçÔ∏è Bleacher Report 1h John Haliburton Apologizes Bleacher Report -1473s Latest Projections and Pro Comps ‚úçÔ∏è Bleacher Report 18h NFL Draft Picks We Wanted to See üëÄ Bleacher Report 18h TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 9h Andrew Van Ginkel, Vikings Agree to $23M Contract Extension After Pro Bowl Season Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d 2026 NFL Mock Draft: B/R's Way-Too-Early Predictions Eagles land CB Avieon Terrell Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 14h Spurs' Stephon Castle Wins 2024-25 NBA Rookie of the Year over Risacher, Wells Spurs rookie takes home the award after averaging 14.7 PPG Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 4h Pacers Stun Fans with OT Comeback as Haliburton Game-Winner Eliminates Giannis, Bucks Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 7h Updated NBA Playoff Bracket 2025 Picture, Schedule After Celtics, Pacers Advance TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 9h Andrew Van Ginkel, Vikings Agree to $23M Contract Extension After Pro Bowl Season Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d 2026 NFL Mock Draft: B/R's Way-Too-Early Predictions Eagles land CB Avieon Terrell Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 14h Spurs' Stephon Castle Wins 2024-25 NBA Rookie of the Year over Risacher, Wells Spurs rookie takes home the award after averaging 14.7 PPG Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 4h Pacers Stun Fans with OT Comeback as Haliburton Game-Winner Eliminates Giannis, Bucks Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 7h Updated NBA Playoff Bracket 2025 Picture, Schedule After Celtics, Pacers Advance Bleacher Report About Advertise Contact Us Get Help Careers Sitemap Community Guidelines Privacy Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information Terms Of Use AdChoices B/R Sports on MAX B/R Creators Program Copyright ¬© 2025 Bleacher Report, Inc.
