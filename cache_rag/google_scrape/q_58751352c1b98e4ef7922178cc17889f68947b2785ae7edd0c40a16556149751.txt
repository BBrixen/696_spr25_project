Unless otherwise noted, all polls listed below are compliant with the regulations of the national polling commission ( Commission nationale des sondages ) and utilize the quota method . First round [ edit ] Ifop-Fiducial and OpinionWay polls listed in the tables below starting in February 2017 are "rolling" polls unless otherwise denoted by an asterisk (*). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The poll by Belgian pollster Dedicated Research commissioned by La Libre Belgique and RTBF and published on 20 February 2017, marked with two asterisks (**) in the table below, was not subject to French regulations. Polls marked with three asterisks (***) from Scan Research/Le Terrain use CATI and random number dialing , unlike all other pollsters, which conduct online surveys using the quota method . The polling commission published notices for each of the two polls conducted by Scan Research/Le Terrain. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Alain Juppé , who lost the primary of the right and centre to Fillon, was floated to replace him as a result of the Fillon affair (Penelopegate). Though tested in some hypothetical polls, Juppé announced on 6 March that he would not be a candidate, regardless of what happened with Fillon. [ 5 ] Graphical summary [ edit ] The averages in the graphs below were constructed using polls listed below conducted by the eight major French pollsters. The graphs are smoothed 14-day weighted moving averages, using only the most recent poll conducted by any given pollster within that range (each poll weighted based on recency). François Bayrou of the Democratic Movement (MoDem) renounced a potential candidacy on 22 February 2017 and instead proposed an alliance with Emmanuel Macron , which he accepted. [ 6 ] Yannick Jadot of Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV) announced that he would withdraw his candidacy and endorsed Benoît Hamon on 23 February after negotiating a common platform with the Socialist nominee; [ 7 ] the agreement was approved by the EELV primary voters on 26 February.

However, understanding that polling institutes would nevertheless be likely to do so, it also recommended that second-round scenarios be tested based on first-round polling, and to test several plausible scenarios, broadly construed. Ifop-Fiducial and OpinionWay polls listed in the tables below starting in February 2017 are "rolling" polls unless otherwise denoted by an asterisk (*). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Polls marked with three asterisks (***) from Scan Research/Le Terrain use CATI and random number dialing , unlike all other pollsters, which conduct online surveys using the quota method . The polling commission published notices for each of the two polls conducted by Scan Research/Le Terrain. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The publication of second-round polls was prohibited after midnight on 5 May 2017. [ 11 ] Graphical summary [ edit ] The averages in the graphs below were constructed using polls listed below conducted by the eight major French pollsters. The graphs are smoothed 14-day weighted moving averages, using only the most recent poll conducted by any given pollster within that range (each poll weighted based on recency). The actual votes gave 66,10% to Macron and 33.90% to Le Pen of expressed votes, shown by larger dots on the right side of the curves.
