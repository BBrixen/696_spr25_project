Temple University Football's Russo Named to Maxwell Award Watch List - Temple Skip to main content Football's Russo Named to Maxwell Award Watch List 7.15.19 | Football Share: PHILADELPHIA - Redshirt junior quarterback Anthony Russo was named to the 2019 Maxwell Award Watch List entering the 2019 college football season. The Maxwell Award, named in honor of Robert W. "Tiny" Maxwell, has been given to America's College Player of the Year since 1937. Maxwell's contributions to the game of football were extensive, including time as a player, a sportswriter and an official. Russo took over the starting quarterback job in week three of the 2018 season leading Temple to its first win of the season, a 35-14 blowout at Maryland. He never looked back piloting the Owls to a 7-3 record in his 10 starts and a berth in the 2018 Independence Bowl. Along the way he completed 198 passes for 2,563 yards which rank among the best in TU history. In just his sixth start, he led the Owls to an overtime win against #20 Cincinnati and followed that with perhaps his best game the next week. On a nationally televised Thursday night stage, Russo went toe-to-toe with Heisman candidate Milton McKenzie reaching career-highs in attempts (52), completions (31), yards (444), and touchdowns (4). Temple fell however, 52-40, at #9 UCF. This is the first time Russo has been named to the Maxwell Award Watch List. He is among 37 quarterbacks selected to the list, but one of only five players from the American Athletics Conference. Semifinalists for the Maxwell Award will be announced October 29, 2019, while the three finalists will be unveiled November 25, 2018. The winner of the 2019 Maxwell Award will be announced as part of the Home Depot College Football Awards Show held on December 12, 2019. The formal presentation will be made at the Maxwell Football Club Awards Gala hosted by Tropicana Hotel & Casino Atlantic City on March 13, 2020. The Maxwell Award is a member of the National College Football Awards Association (NCFAA) which encompasses the most prestigious awards in college football. The 25 awards boast over 800 recipients since 1935. Visit www.NCFAA.org to learn more. Terms of Service Privacy Policy Accessibility Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information Sidearm
