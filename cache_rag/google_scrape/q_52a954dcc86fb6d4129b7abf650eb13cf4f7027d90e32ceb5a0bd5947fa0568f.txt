The Detroit Lions linebacker will begin his two-year term immediately. "I am honored by the trust that the Board has shown in me and I will work hard to be a voice and advocate for all players," said Reeves-Maybin, a seven-year NFL veteran. "It will be my mission to continue to serve and unify our membership and I look forward to inspiring more players to use their voice in advocating for the union and our game." Reeves-Maybin replaces JC Tretter, who served two consecutive terms before cycling off the NFLPA’s leadership because he was not on an NFL roster this past season. "Serving the players has been the honor of my lifetime and I want to thank our Executive Committee and Board of Player Representatives for entrusting me with this heavy responsibility over the last four years,” Tretter said. “Congratulations to Jalen on his election - I am confident that he will continue the awesome legacy of player leadership to fulfill the union's mission of serving players past, present and future." Reeves-Maybin played at the University of Tennessee before being selected by the Detroit Lions in the 2017 NFL Draft. He spent his first five years with the franchise, and then played one season with the Houston Texans before returning to the Lions in 2023. The 2023 Pro Bowler is no stranger to leadership within the NFLPA. He was elected as Detroit’s first alternate in 2021 and was voted on to the union’s Executive Committee in 2022. Upon rejoining Detroit in 2023, Reeves-Maybin was once again elected as the team’s first alternate. "I want to congratulate Jalen on his election as the NFLPA's new president,” NFLPA Executive Director Lloyd Howell said. “Jalen will bring tremendous leadership to our union, a commitment to serving our players and our player-driven agenda. I look forward to working closely with him in the coming years. I also want to take the opportunity to thank JC Tretter for his dedication and all his accomplishments as president the last four years." Additionally, four new players were voted by the board to serve two-year terms on the Executive Committee: Thomas Hennessy (treasurer) Oren Burks, Cameron Heyward and Case Keenum. They will join returning Executive Committee members Calais Campbell, Austin Ekeler, Ryan Kelly, Brandon McManus, Thomas Morstead and Michael Thomas (Cincinnati Bengals) who were all re-elected on Friday for two-year terms.

Established in 1956, the NFLPA has a long history of assuring proper recognition and representation of players’ interests. The NFLPA has shown that it will do whatever is necessary to assure that the rights of players are protected—including ceasing to be a union, if necessary, as it did in 1989. In 1993, the NFLPA again was officially recognized as the union representing the players and negotiated a landmark Collective Bargaining Agreement with the NFL. The current CBA will govern the sport through the 2030 NFL season. Learn more at www.nflpa.com .
