Craddock, author of the Stay Awhile and Listen trilogy of books covering the founding and closure of Blizzard North, shared this screen shot of the earliest version of Diablo 3 from its first build circa 2001-2003: https://twitter.com/davidlcraddock/status/1021021813378363394 As you can see, the art style uses a more photorealistic approach similar to that of Diablo 2, as well as some of its UI assets - possibly due to being in early alpha stage of development. Worth noting are features such as the return of the stamina bar, as well as the player character donning some type of cloak item. The screenshot was given to Craddock by D2/X artist David Glenn, who was part of the mass Blizzard North exodus and went on to join Flagship Studios in 2005. As explained by the founders and top developers at Blizzard North, the departures and eventual closure of the studio was due to the team wanting a say in who Vivendi sold the company to at the time in 2003. This huge loss resulted in a restructuring of remaining Diablo 3 staff who went on to produce a 2nd version which was later  leaked , before final closure in 2005 and the full scrapping of Blizzard North's games. The original Diablo 3: planned MMO? When Diablo 3 first went into development, the team thought of making it an MMO. Revealed by Blizzard North co-founder Max Schaefer: MAX SCHAEFER: We wanted to make it bigger… we actually were going a more MMO route with it. So, it had more players in the game. But, we were very early and it’s the point in a project where you don’t talk to the public about it because so much can change and so much can go on . ... There's no way of knowing if the MMO route would have stuck through development, but it is fun to speculate what this version of Diablo 3 would have been like if completed back in the mid 2000s.
