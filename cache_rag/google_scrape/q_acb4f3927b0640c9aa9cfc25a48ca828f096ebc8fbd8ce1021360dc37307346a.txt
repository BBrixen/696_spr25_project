Maxwell was named theÂ CFDAs' top emerging womenswear designer in 2016, but MondayÂ night's ceremonyÂ was the first time the 34-year-old won one of the annual awards show's top prizes. HeÂ was overcome with joy and nerves when he took the stage, admitting to the crowd that he would've laid off the event's open bar had he known he was going to win. In addition to dressing Michelle Obama and DuchessÂ Meghan and recruiting fashion weeks' buzziestÂ supermodels to walk for him, Maxwell has also proven his commitment to diversity and inclusion, casting women of different races and sizes in his runway shows. Winning one of the night's most prestigious awards is an important co-sign of his work, and proof that, as outgoing CFDAs chair Diane Von Furstenberg said earlier in the night, that the council is "aware" of the progress needed in fashion when it comes to inclusive casting and sizing alike. "To the nominees in this category, you cannot imagine what it feels like to be in your company for me," he addressed the crowd onstage. "It is an absolute pleasure...this is reallyÂ once-in-a-lifetime, this is never going to happen to me again." Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

"I have worked for ten years as a stylist before I started my company with almost every single person in this room," he said. "And I know that you're kind people and you work hard, and we scrubbed off tonight and put on a suit but the other 364 days of the year we are trying to pay the light bill and make it happen." The night's other winners included Rick Owens for best menswear designer andÂ Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's The Row for best accessories design, as well as Jennifer Lopez with the fashion icon award .
