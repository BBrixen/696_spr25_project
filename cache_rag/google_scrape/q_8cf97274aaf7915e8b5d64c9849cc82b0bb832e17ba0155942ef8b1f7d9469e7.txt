Nadal is one of three men to complete the career Golden Slam in singles. [ b ] His 81 consecutive wins on clay constitute the longest single-surface win streak in the Open Era . For nearly two decades, Nadal was a leading figure in men's tennis, alongside Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic , collectively known as the Big Three . Early in his career, Nadal became one of the most successful teenagers in ATP Tour history, reaching No. 2 in the world and winning 16 titles before turning 20, including his first major title at the 2005 French Open . Nadal became the world No. 1 for the first time in 2008 after defeating Federer in an historic Wimbledon final , his first major championship off clay. He followed with an Olympic singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics . By defeating Djokovic in the 2010 US Open final, Nadal became the youngest man in the Open Era to achieve the career Grand Slam at 24, and the first man to win majors on three different surfaces in the same year. Nadal won major singles titles in 10 consecutive years from 2005 to 2014, and again in a four-year span from 2017 to 2020.

Nadal retired from the sport after playing for Spain in the 2024 Davis Cup Finals . As a left-handed player, one of Nadal's main strengths was his forehand, delivered with heavy topspin. He frequently ranked among the tour leaders in return games, return points, and break points won. His game was especially well-suited for clay courts , on which came 63 of his 92 singles titles. Nadal won the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award five times and was the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2011 and 2021.

Early life Rafael Nadal Parera was born on 3 June 1986 in Manacor on the island of Mallorca , Spain, to Ana María Parera Femenías and Sebastián Nadal Homar. [ 6 ] His father is a businessman who owns an insurance company, a glass and window company, and a restaurant. His mother owned a perfume shop but gave it up to raise Nadal and his younger sister, María Isabel. [ 7 ] One of his uncles, Miguel Ángel Nadal , is a retired professional footballer who played for RCD Mallorca , FC Barcelona and the Spanish national team . [ 8 ] As a child, he idolized Ronaldo , and through his uncle was given access to the Barcelona team dressing room to have a photo taken with the Brazilian. [ 9 ] Another uncle, tennis coach Toni Nadal , introduced him to tennis when he was three years old. [ 10 ] Nadal started to play tennis at the Manacor Tennis Club, where Toni worked as a coach, hitting his first few shots with his uncle. [ 7 ] [ 10 ] At this stage Nadal's passion was football, which he often played on the streets of Manacor with his friends. [ 7 ] [ 11 ] He began to play tennis more regularly when he was five. Toni quickly realized that his young nephew had both the passion and talent to be a serious player. [ 10 ] Nadal often played tennis in a group, but Toni singled him out during sessions, shouting at him instead of the other kids, and making him pick up the balls and sweep the courts. [ 7 ] In his 2011 autobiography, he admitted fearing Toni and dreading solo practice sessions with him. [ 12 ] Nadal admitted he sometimes returned home from tennis lessons crying. [ 13 ] At age 8, Nadal won an under-12 regional tennis championship while also being a promising football player. [ 7 ] [ 14 ] This victory inspired Toni to train Nadal more intensively. After studying Nadal's two-handed forehand , Toni encouraged him to play left-handed for a natural advantage on the tennis court. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] The transition was difficult for Nadal, but Toni helped him make the change, getting him to try it for just 20 minutes per day before gradually increasing that time until he fully adjusted himself to it. [ 7 ] Career 1997–2000: Juniors Nadal won the Spanish junior championships in 1997 and 1998, beating Ricardo Villacorta and Marcel Granollers respectively. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] In 1998 Nadal reached the final of the U14 Spanish championship at the age of 12, a feat that remains unmatched, losing to Juan Sanchez de Luna in straight sets.

[ 19 ] In February 1998, Nadal competed outside Spain for the first time and won the Open Super 12, an unofficial world championship for U12 players in Auray . He beat 1997 winner Jamie Murray in the final. [ 20 ] At the time, Nadal was torn between football and tennis, partly because his uncle Miguel Ángel was preparing to compete in the 1998 FIFA World Cup with Spain. [ 21 ] Nadal said winning the Auray tournament helped him make the decision to "opt for tennis and try an international career". [ 20 ] [ 21 ] In 1998, when Nadal was runner-up in the U14 event Spanish championship, he was still playing football. [ 7 ] Nadal's father insisted he choose between football and tennis to so his schoolwork wouldn't suffer, leading Nadal to quit football. [ 14 ] In 1999, the 12-year-old Nadal was playing in the U14 circuit of the ETA Junior Tour (now the Tennis Europe Junior Tour ), winning the Tim Essonne , [ 22 ] and finishing the year at No. 69.

[ 30 ] Nadal ended 2000 at No. 5 of the ETA rankings for U14s. [ 23 ] His junior results secured Nadal a tennis scholarship in Barcelona , and the Spanish tennis federation requested that Nadal move to Barcelona to continue his tennis training. [ 7 ] His family turned down this request, partly because they feared his education would suffer, [ 14 ] but also because Toni said, "I don't want to believe that you have to go to America or other places to be a good athlete. You can do it from your home." [ 7 ] [ 10 ] Nadal already was by then practicing three times a week at Palma with former World No. 1 Carlos Moyá , who later became Nadal's mentor and confidant, [ 7 ] [ 10 ] and whom Nadal beat in 2000, at the time still a Top-10 player, in an exhibition match. [ 31 ] The decision to stay home meant less financial support from the federation; instead, Nadal's father covered the costs.

[ 384 ] [ 385 ] Nadal ascended to No. 2 in July 2005 and held this spot for a record 160 consecutive weeks before surpassing Federer in August 2008. [ 386 ] Nadal and Federer are also the only pair of men to have ever finished six consecutive calendar years at the top 2 positions (from 2005 to 2010). [ 387 ] Nadal and Federer faced each other 40 times, with Nadal leading 24–16 overall and 10–4 in Grand Slam matches. Nadal had a winning record on clay (14–2) and outdoor hard courts (8–6), while Federer led on indoor hard courts (5–1) and grass (3–1). [ 388 ] 24 of their matches were in tournament finals, including a joint-record nine major finals (tied with Djokovic–Nadal ). [ 112 ] From 2006 to 2008, they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final, and also met in the title matches of the 2009 Australian Open, the 2011 French Open and the 2017 Australian Open. [ 112 ] Nadal won six of the nine, losing the first two Wimbledon finals and 2017 in Australia. Four of these matches were five-set matches (2007 and 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 and 2017 Australian Open), and the 2008 Wimbledon final has been lauded as the greatest match ever. [ 117 ] [ 389 ] [ 390 ] [ 391 ] Nadal was the only player to defeat Federer in the final of a major on all three surfaces (grass, hard court, and clay). Nadal vs. Djokovic Main article: Djokovic–Nadal rivalry Novak Djokovic and Nadal met 60 times, more than any other pair in the Open Era. Nadal led 11–7 at Grand Slam events but trailed 29–31 overall. [ 243 ] [ 392 ] They played a record 18 Grand Slam matches and a joint-record nine Grand Slam tournament finals (tied with Nadal–Federer ). Nadal led on clay (20–9), while Djokovic led on hard courts (20–7), and they were tied 2–2 on grass. [ 243 ] [ 392 ] In 2009, this rivalry was listed as the third greatest of the previous 10 years by ATPworldtour.com.

They also played in a record 14 ATP Masters finals. In their first Grand Slam final at the 2010 US Open, Nadal beat Djokovic in four sets, achieving the career Grand Slam. [ 394 ] In 2011–12, they contested four consecutive major finals, with Djokovic winning the first three at Wimbledon, [ 395 ] the US Open, and the Australian Open, the last being the longest Grand Slam final in history at 5 hours and 53 minutes.

[ 213 ] In 2013, Djokovic defeated Nadal in straight sets in the final at Monte Carlo, ending Nadal's record eight consecutive titles there, but Nadal earned revenge in the French Open semifinals in an epic five-setter.

[ 397 ] Legacy Nadal is, without a doubt, the best athlete in the history of Spain. Spain has to pay him a tribute for many, many years. Nadal is the king of Roland Garros and of world tennis. He has achieved a record that is very difficult to beat. — Felipe VI , on Nadal's legacy after he won his 22nd Grand Slam at the French Open in 2022. [ 398 ] Nadal won the second-most major men's singles titles (22) in tennis history and the second-most "Big" titles (59) since 1990. He appeared in the Top 10 of the ATP rankings consecutively from April 2005 to March 2023 – a record spanning 912 weeks. He stands alone in the Open Era as the player with the most clay court titles (63), consisting of an all-time record 14 French Open titles, 12 Barcelona Open titles, 11 Monte-Carlo Masters titles, and 10 Italian Open titles. His 14 French Open titles are a record at any single tournament , and he holds the open era records for the longest single-surface win streak in matches (81 on clay) and in sets (50 on clay). Nadal holds the men's all-time records for the most majors won without losing a set (4), the most match wins at a single major (112 at the French Open), and the highest match-winning percentage at clay court majors (96.6%), among many others. Nadal's dominance on clay is reflected by his honorific title as the "King of Clay", [ c ] and he is widely regarded as the greatest clay-court player in history. [ d ] Nadal is considered by many to be the greatest player in tennis history. [ e ] Nadal is one of three men, along with Agassi and Djokovic, to win the Olympic gold medal as well as the four majors in singles in his career, a feat known as a Career Golden Slam . He is the only male player in history to complete the Career Grand Slam and win an Olympic gold medal in both singles and doubles. [ f ] He is one of four men in history, along with Roy Emerson , Rod Laver and Djokovic, to complete the double Career Grand Slam in singles. Among numerous career accolades, Nadal was the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2011 and 2021, and was 2010 BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year . [ 423 ] He is an honorary recipient of the Grand Cross of Royal Order of Sports Merit , Grand Cross of Order of the Second of May , the Grand Cross of Naval Merit , the Princess of Asturias Award , and the Medal of the City of Paris . He was ranked as one of the world's highest-paid athletes by Forbes magazine in 2014 and named among the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2022. [ 424 ] In 2019, former world No. 1 and 1995 French Open champion Thomas Muster stated: "Rafael Nadal is the best clay-court player ever". [ 425 ] Former world No. 1 Carlos Moyá stated in 2010 that Nadal was "one of the greatest ever. But he is on his way to become, who knows, maybe the greatest". [ 426 ] Former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero : "Rafa is the king of knowing how to adapt to any situation in the match". [ 29 ] Former world No. 1 and rival Novak Djokovic: "Our encounters have made me the player I am today". [ 29 ] Former world No. 1 and rival Roger Federer: "I have always had the utmost respect for my friend Rafa as a person and as a champion. I believe we have pushed each other to become better players". [ 29 ] Nadal played an instrumental role in the sport's revival, ushering in the Golden Age of tennis, which saw increased interest and higher revenues across tennis venues globally. The Djokovic–Nadal and Federer–Nadal rivalries are widely considered by players, coaches, and pundits to be among the greatest rivalries in sports history. [ 427 ] [ 428 ] Player profile Playing style Nadal generally played an aggressive, behind-the- baseline game based on heavy topspin groundstrokes, consistency and shrewd court coverage; an aggressive counterpuncher. [ 429 ] Nadal hitting a forehand. Known for his athleticism and speed around the court in his 20s, Nadal was an excellent defender [ 430 ] who hit well on the run, constructing winning plays from seemingly defensive positions. He also played very fine dropshots, which worked well because his heavy topspin often forced opponents to the back of the court. [ 431 ] Nadal employed a semi-western grip forehand, often with a "lasso-whip" follow-through, where his left arm hit through the ball and finished above his left shoulder. [ 432 ] [ 433 ] Nadal's forehand allowed him to hit shots with heavy topspin – more so than his contemporaries. [ 434 ] San Francisco tennis researcher John Yandell used a high-speed video camera and special software to count the average number of revolutions of a tennis ball hit full force by Nadal. Yandell concluded: The first guys we did were Sampras and Agassi. They were hitting forehands that in general were spinning about 1,800 to 1,900 revolutions per minute. Federer is hitting with an amazing amount of spin, too, right? 2,700 revolutions per minute. Well, we measured one forehand Nadal hit at 4,900. His average was 3,200. [ 435 ] While Nadal's shots tended to land short of the baseline, the characteristically high bounces his forehands achieved tended to mitigate the advantage an opponent would normally gain from capitalizing on a short ball. [ 436 ] Although his forehand was based on heavy topspin, he hit the ball deep and flat with a more orthodox follow through for clean winners, but instead of being admired for his finesse and angles, it was the brutality of his groundstrokes that caught the public eye. [ 29 ] Nadal's serve was considered a weak point in his game, although his high number of first-serve points won and break points saved allowed him to consistently compete for and win major titles on faster surfaces. Before the 2010 US Open, he altered his service motion. He arrived in the trophy pose earlier, pulled the racket lower during the trophy pose and modified his service grip to a more continental one, [ 185 ] He increased his average speed by around 10 mph during the 2010 US Open, maxing out at 135 mph (217 km/h), allowing him to win more free points on his serve. [ 437 ] After the 2010 US Open, Nadal's serve speed dropped to previous levels and was again cited as in need of improvement. [ 438 ] [ 439 ] [ 440 ] From 2019 onwards, several analysts praised Nadal's improvement on the serve, noting the speed of his serve had increased. [ 441 ] [ 442 ] [ 443 ] Nadal, a clay court maestro, was also successful on hard courts. However, Nadal himself admitted that playing a lot on them is tiring and takes a physical toll on ATP Tour players, so he repeatedly requested for a reevaluated tour schedule featuring fewer hard court tournaments and increasing the weeks of rest. [ 444 ] Early in his career some questioned his longevity in the sport, citing his build and playing style as conducive to injury. [ 445 ] After winning the 2010 US Open, former world No. 1 Pete Sampras stated: "The only question with Rafa is physically how much his body can handle the pounding with how hard he works for every point. You just watch him play, the kid is relentless". [ 446 ] This "longevity" narrative was proven inaccurate, and pundits later admired his resilience to come back from devastating injuries and his ability to play with physical pain. [ 447 ] Attitude and demeanor Freezing cold water. I do this before every match. It's the point before the point of no return. Under the cold shower I enter a new space in which I feel my power and resilience grow. I'm a different man when I emerge. I'm activated. I'm in "the flow"... Nothing else exists but the battle ahead. –Nadal, on his pre-match rituals. [ 448 ] Despite his success, his uncle Toni ensured that Nadal remained as normal, modest, and down to earth as possible and believed these qualities had a tremendous impact on his results and motivation. [ 7 ] He rarely if ever touted his achievements, refused to put down his rivals, and lingered after matches and practices to sign autographs. [ 449 ] For instance, in 2007, Nadal would often interrupt his training sessions on the public courts of Manacor, just to hit a few balls with fans and foreign tourists that had asked him to, even though they were not very good, and even against his uncle Toni’s wishes. [ 10 ] Nadal was also noted for his visceral delight in competing, whether he won or lost. [ 449 ] He also had a rare philosophical approach to tennis and life that one sportswriter described as a "model of humility, empathy, and perspective". [ 449 ] Nadal was known for his on-court rituals including specific bodily movements and the positioning of items courtside. [ 450 ] [ 451 ] At changeovers, he always waited until his opponent crossed the net, refused to step on the lines, and lined up his drinks bottles in precise positions near his chair, labels always facing out, before stepping back into action. [ 452 ] His water-bottle routine was so well-known that when they fell over during a match at the 2015 Australian Open, a ball boy dashed over to return the bottles to their upright position, with the labels facing the court as Nadal had intended. [ 449 ] Nadal explained that such rituals were meant to work as a psychological mechanism to help him stay calm in stressful situations. [ 449 ] [ 453 ] There was a pattern to the way he approached a serve. He usually took three balls, examined them, discarded one, shook the strands of hair that were not corralled by his headband out of his eyes, and then served. [ 454 ] Nadal's extensive time taken between points received criticism from other players including Roger Federer and Denis Shapovalov , [ 455 ] [ 456 ] with the latter wanting Nadal to be given a code violation for pushing the 25-second serve clock to the limit, stating that he was being given preferential treatment because of his status in the game. [ 452 ] Coaching and personal team Nadal's first and most important coach was his uncle Toni Nadal , who coached him from 1990 to 2017 (aged 4 to 31). [ 457 ] Though strong physically as a player, Toni Nadal struggled to be aggressive with his forehand and possessed no big shots. Along with working on the mental and physical sides, he ensured that his nephew developed a good technical, all-round aggressive game, became competent at the net, and developed his forehand into a weapon. [ 7 ] Aged 12, Nadal began attending the Balearic Islands training centre 50 kilometers away from Manacor in Palma. [ 7 ] He and his uncle trained there three times a week, so that Nadal could train with the best boys in the Balearic Islands. There, he was trained along with his uncle Toni, by Toni Colom, who travelled with Nadal at mainly Futures events for the next four years, between 1999 and 2003. [ 7 ] Colom explained that he "was traveling to those tournaments because I had a bigger availability of traveling [than Toni] and not because I was more experienced". [ 458 ] After 2005, Nadal left the structure of the Balearic School and created his own team. [ 459 ] Nadal worked with the same team from 2006 to 2017, which consisted of members from his family and professional staff, whom Nadal also considered his family. [ 460 ] Besides Toni, the first members of his team were Joan Forcades, Nadal's instructor since childhood, [ 460 ] and doctor Ángel Ruiz Cotorro. [ 461 ] Cotorro, who also worked with Juan Martín del Potro and Arantxa Sánchez Vicario , helped him play after facing injuries and his suggestions were pivotal to his game. [ 461 ] Nadal said of his doctor that: "I trust Dr. Cotorro with my life". [ 461 ] Forcades was the lead fitness expert for Nadal and developed his training program. [ 460 ] Toni has described his coaching style as 'hard', saying that he occasionally put too much pressure on Nadal, but that he did so because he wanted him to succeed. [ 462 ] Together, they won 16 major titles between 2005 and 2017, making them the second most successful tennis coach-player partnership only behind Marián Vajda and Novak Djokovic . [ 462 ] Carlos Costa was Nadal's agent from 2005. [ 463 ] [ 464 ] In 2006, Costa and Nadal's father convinced Benito Pérez Barbadillo, who had been working as the press officer of the ATP since the late 1990s, to open his own company (B1PR) to work with them as Nadal's communications director (PR manager). [ 463 ] [ 465 ] Nadal then hired physiotherapist Rafael Maymó, who designed his physical preparation with Forcades and who was one of Nadal's closest friends, thus also acting as a psychologist. [ 460 ] [ 463 ] After signing his new coach Carlos Moyá in December 2016, [ 466 ] Nadal's game style acquired a more offensive approach. Under Moyá's direction, Nadal improved his serve, [ 467 ] [ 443 ] and incorporated serve-and-volley as a surprise tactic in some of his matches. [ 468 ] Moyá, who has known Nadal since he was 12, was more a friend than a coach, and when he realized that Nadal was going through a bad time, he left his duty as a coach and acted like a friend with whom Nadal could speak to. [ 462 ] Francisco Roig , who was hired by Nadal in 2005, acted as the alternate coach. [ 462 ] [ 469 ] Equipment and apparel Nadal wearing his signature Nike sleeveless shirt at the French Open in 2007, while holding his Babolat racquet Nike served as Nadal's clothing and shoe sponsor.

[ 379 ] Nadal met his future wife, María Francisca (Mery) Perelló Pascual through his younger sister, María Isabel. They began dating in 2005, when he was 19 and she was 17, and only formalized their relationship publicly in 2007, with their engagement reported in January 2019.
