This means that the Dora Maxwell, Louise Herring, and Desjardins awards have been paused for this year. Leagues still have the opportunity to offer these awards on their own, so please contact your league for details. Social Responsibility Award Dora Maxwell CUNA created the Dora Maxwell Social Responsibility Award to encourage and honor credit union and chapter involvement in community projects and activities. Dora Maxwell was a community activist who committed her life to credit union development, to her community and to serving the underserved. Learn more Philosophy in Action Award Louise Herring This award, named for one of the original signers of the 1934 constitution that created CUNA, recognizes credit unions that do an extraordinary job incorporating credit union philosophy into daily operations. Louise Herring started numerous credit unions and believed strongly in applying credit union philosophy as an operating principle.
