Tours Photo Albums - Cruises Image Gallery Video Gallery Podcast Gallery Greenside Chats Golf Travel News Email Signup Log In Past Open Championship Result at the Old Course, St Andrews The Old Course at St Andrews has played host to The Open Championship 30 times, most recently in 2022. The following is a list of the past champions: Year Winner Score Notes R1 R2 R3 R4 Total 1873 Tom  			Kidd 91 88 -- -- 179 This  			was the first time the Open Championship was played on an 18-hole  			course. Instead of three round of 12 holes, there were two rounds  			of 18. Kidd won 11 pounds. 1876 Bob  			Martin 1st 86 90 -- -- 176 Due  			to a controversial ruling, Bob Martin finished in a tie for first.  			In protest, his opponent Davie Strath refused to participate so  			Martin walked the course and became the Open Champion. 1879 Jamie  			Anderson 3rd 84 85 -- -- 169 With  			this win, Jamie Anderson became the first person to break 170 in  			the Open Championship. 1882 Bob  			Ferguson 3rd 83 88 -- -- 171 This  			was the third straight Open Championship for Ferguson. He won 12  			pounds. 1885 Bob  			Martin 2nd 84 87 -- -- 171 The  			third of Martin's Open Championship wins, he won 10 pounds. 1888 Jack  			Burns 86 85 -- -- 171 Burns  			won after his score was re-added, giving him a one-stroke victory. 1891 Hugh  			Kirkaldy 83 83 -- -- 166 Kirkaldy  			set the tournament record with his 166. This was also the last  			Open Championship that was 36 holes. 1895 J.H.  			Taylor 2nd 86 78 80 78 322 This  			was the first Open to be played over two days (36 holes a day) and  			a total of 72 holes at St Andrews. He shot the first sub-80 rounds  			at St Andrews. 1900 J.H.  			Taylor 3rd 79 77 78 75 309 This  			open marked the first time the "Great Triumvirate"  			finished 1-2-3. That was the name given to the three golfers who  			dominated the game in the late 1800s to the early 1900s. From 1894  			to 1906, J.H. Taylor, Harry Vardon, and James Braid combined to  			win 16 Open Championships. This was Taylor's third of five Open  			Championships. 1905 James  			Braid 2nd 81 78 78 81 318 This  			was the first Open to be played over three days, with 36 holes on  			the last day. This was Braid's second of five Open Championships. 1910 James  			Braid 5th 76 73 74 76 299 This  			Open was the last of Braid's five Open Championships. With this  			win he became the first person to break 300 in a four-round Open  			at St Andrews, and was the first to win five Open Championships. 1921 Jock  			Hutchison 72 75 79 70 296 PO Born  			in Scotland, Hutchison was the first American citizen to win the  			Open Championship with this win. This was also the first time  			Bobby Jones played St Andrews. He ended up walking off the course  			after he took four shots to get out of a bunker on the 11th hole. 1927 Bobby  			Jones (a) 2nd 68 72 73 72 285 (-3) This  			win marked Bobby Jones' first Open championship win at St Andrews,  			his second straight Open Championship, fourth professional major,  			and his 7th career major (he was a three-time winner of the U.S.  			Amateur). 1933 Denny  			Shute 73 73 73 73 292 (+4) PO Shute  			won the Open title by five strokes in a playoff against Craig  			Wood. Leo Diegel could have joined them but he whiffed a putt on  			the 72nd hole, finishing one shot off the lead. 1939 Dick  			Burton 70 72 77 71 290 (-2) The  			1939 Open was the last Open until 1946 because of World  			War II .  			The Royal  			Air Force used the fairways of the Old Course as runways. Burton held the  			Claret Jug the longest (7 years), until the tournament resumed in 1946 ,  			also at St Andrews. 1946 Sam  			Snead 71 70 74 75 290 (-2) Even  			though Sam Snead won the first Open Championship to be played  			since 1939 ,  			he still lost money because of the high travel expenses; his  			winner's share was $600. When taking the train into St Andrews,  			Sam Snead is quoted for looking out of the window and saying "Say,  			that looks like an old abandoned golf course" about the Old  			Course. 1955 Peter  			Thomson 2nd 71 68 70 72 281 (−7) This  			was the second of Thomson's three straight Open titles, and five  			overall. His winner's share was $2,800. 1957 Bobby  			Locke 4th 69 72 68 70 279 (−9) Between  			1949 and 1957, Locke won the Open title four times. He survived a  			possible disqualification when he marked his ball on the 72nd  			green, and played his ball without replacing his ball mark. The  			R&A decided that because he had a three shot lead, and he  			didn't gain an advantage, that in the spirit of the game, he  			should not be disqualified. The winner's share was $2,800. 1960 Kel  			Nagle 69 67 71 71 278 (−10) This  			was the 100th anniversary of the Open Championship, although due  			to wars it wasn't the 100th Open Championship to be played. Arnold  			Palmer finished second and is credited with returning the Open to  			the eyes of Americans. The winner's share was $3,500. 1964 Tony  			Lema 73 68 68 70 279 (−9) From  			1962 to 1966, Lema won 12 times on tour, but this was his only  			major. He beat Jack Nicklaus by five strokes, and his winner's  			share was $4,200. Tragically, Lema and his pregnant wife were  			killed in a plane crash two years later. 1970 Jack  			Nicklaus 2nd 68 69 73 73 283 (−5)PO Doug  			Sanders missed a tough two and a half foot putt on the 72nd hole,  			bogeyed, and ended up tied with Nicklaus. The playoff the next day  			came down to 18th hole when Nicklaus birdied to win the Open  			title. This was his second Open title and eight overall major; the  			winner's share was $12,600. 1978 Jack  			Nicklaus 3rd 71 72 69 69 281 (−7) Nicklaus  			completed the career Grand Slam (winning all four majors in your  			career at least once) for the third time making it his third Open  			Championship. The winner's share was $23,750 1984 Seve  			Ballesteros 2nd 69 68 70 69 276 (−12) The  			leaderboard for the final day was full of the best golfers in the  			world at the time. Ballesteros beat Bernhard Langer, Tom Watson,  			Fred Couples, Lanny Wadkins, Nick Faldo, and Greg Norman to make  			an epic final round at St Andrews. Ballesteros birdied the 72nd  			hole to win by two, and his fist pump is an iconic image to this  			day. His winner's share was $71,500. 1990 Nick  			Faldo 2nd 67 65 67 71 270 (−18) Faldo  			set the Open championship scoring record shooting 18 under par,  			winning his second major of the year, his second Open Championship  			and his fourth overall major. The winner's share was $153,850. 1995 John  			Daly 67 71 73 71 282 (−6)PO This  			Open was significant because it was the first that Tiger Woods  			played in, and the last the Arnold Palmer played in, getting to  			have his farewell at St Andrews. John Daly beat Costantino Rocca  			in a four-hole playoff to win the Open title and $199,375. 2000 Tiger  			Woods 1st 67 66 67 69 269 (−19) Winning  			the 2000 British Open was Tiger Woods' second consecutive major  			championship; he would win the next two as well for four  			consecutive major victories over two years - the "Tiger  			Slam". He didn't hit a single bunker the entire tournament,  			shot in the 60's all four rounds, won by eight strokes, and set  			the new Open Championship scoring record with 19 under par. The  			winner's share was $759,150. 2005 Tiger  			Woods 2nd 66 67 71 70 274 (−14) This  			was Jack Nicklaus's last Open Championship and like Arnold Palmer,  			he finished on the Old Course. This was also Tiger's 10th major  			championship and the fourth one he had won by five or more  			strokes, and the winner's share was $1,261,285. 2010 Louis  			Oosthuizen 65 67 69 71 272 (−16) On  			the 150th anniversary of the  			first Open Championship ,  			Oosthuizen played consistently well, winning the Open title by  			shooting a 16 under par 272 and winning by seven strokes. Rory  			McIlroy shot a 63 in the opening round and the winner's share was  			$1,305,593. 2015 Zach Johnson 66 71 70 66 273 (−15) In the 144th playing of the Open Championship, Zach Johnson emerged from a three-man playoff to win the tournament. The tournament finished on Monday due to the extremely high winds that arose during Saturday's round. Johnson defeated Louis Oosthuizen and Marc Leishman in a four-hole playoff. 2022 Cameron Smith 67 64 73 64 268 (−20) In the 150th playing of the Open Championship, with a final round 64, Smith came from four strokes behind third-round leaders Rory   McIlroy and Viktor Hovland to win by one from Cameron   Young . Smith's winning score of 268 (20 under par) set a new   record for the lowest aggregate over the Old Course in the Open, and   tied the championship to-par record, set by Henrik   Stenson at Troon in 2016 .   The winner's share was £2,100,000. Note: Multiple  	winners of The Open Championship have superscript ordinal  	designating which in their respective careers.
