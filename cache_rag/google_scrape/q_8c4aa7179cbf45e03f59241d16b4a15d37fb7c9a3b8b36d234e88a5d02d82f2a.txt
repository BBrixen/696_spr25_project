Shame on Greys Anatomy making it about politics. So disgusted…that’s why your ratings have dropped…people are fed up with Hollywood and their crap. Took a great show and destroyed it. Thanks a lot. Hope they cancel it. 0 -2 Reply Robert Iannone May 10, 2021 7:37 pm I have liked this series until the last season. I thought she was on the beach for too many episodes. The writing has not been that good this year. I though the April and Jackson episode was the best. Sometimes a show has played out. I hear there will be a next season so I hope the writing improves over season17. 0 0 Reply Linda M May 7, 2021 6:35 pm Please do not cancel Grey’s Anatomy. Been watching since day one. This show is on my favorite list. 1 0 Reply Sharron Lane February 15, 2021 5:55 pm Grey’s Anatomy has to stay.

But this season please put teddy and yang’s ex out of there misery kill them off or married and happy ever after and poor thing Dr webber … Read more » 2 -1 Reply Wanda.schonfelder November 16, 2020 12:36 pm I always look forward to watch the program I love this show.. 8 -1 Reply Jill Brodnik November 15, 2020 11:24 pm Been watching for soooo long , but like other shows , don’t turn it on to a total soap !!! 2 -2 Reply Catherine Stearns November 15, 2020 8:22 pm I absolutely love this show and I have watched every single episode since the show started.  It is my favorite show and always tape it if I can’t watch when it is in each week.  I love the actors/actresses, and the story lines.  It is always always top notch! 7 -1 Reply Melinda November 13, 2020 6:30 pm Although I have not liked the last few seasons, Mainly because of alot of the newer characters. I do love how the season opener ended, with Meredith seeing Derek. It was quite a shocker, but in s good way.  I will continue watching it if it gets renewed. 9 0 Reply charles david haskell November 13, 2020 6:18 pm I truly enjoy the first episode of Grey’s Anatomy and I still believe that ABC will renewal the show for the 18th season. 5 -1 Reply Hippydippyscot Reply to charles david haskell April 30, 2021 9:45 am This depends on how much ABC offers Ellen Pompeo to stay for one more season as Shonda Rhimes the creator has already said when Ellen leaves the show comes to an and and has left the decision to her friend Ellen Pompeo. Now that’s friendship for you. I can see ABC offering Ellen Pomeo a million to do season 18 as they do not want to lose their Flagship show which is still No 1 in the ratings after 16 years which is amazing. 0 0 Reply Kathy November 13, 2020 10:31 am This show is getting to be really boring and I’m losing a lot of interest in even watching it. 4 -9 Reply Deb Kimokeo Reply to Kathy November 15, 2020 3:59 am Kathy, For you, it might be time to shut it off & no longer watch it. Do know there are many who still really appreciate it still and hope people continue to discover it. Be well. 4 -4 Reply Freda Reply to Kathy April 24, 2021 3:28 am Your right , this show sucks. So does Ellen pompeo if they killed her off it might be worth watching 1 -2 Reply Hippydippyscot Reply to Freda April 30, 2021 9:39 am Shonda Rhimes the creator of Grey’s Anatomy has already said during interviews the she made a pact with her friend Ellen Pompeo which is huge. When Ellen Pompeo wants to leave GA then the show will come to an end. The network is still negotioning with Ellen Pompeo on how much money she will accept for one more season but Ellen has not made a decision yet. I can honestly see ABC offering Ellen 1 million to do one more season as they don’t want to lose their Flagship show which is still No 1 in the ratings afttr 16 … Read more » 0 0 Reply wpDiscuz Cancelled TV Show Lists Ratings (by TV Channel) Status Lists of 800+ Shows Cancellations Renewals The Equalizer, The Neighborhood: Plans for CBS Spin-Off Series Cancelled Heartstopper: No Season Four But Netflix Series Ending with a Movie The Summit: Cancelled; No Second Season for Mountain Climbing Competition on CBS Poppa's House: Cancelled, No Season Two for CBS Comedy Series (Reaction) Citadel: Spin-Offs Now Cancelled, Will Be Integrated into Season Two of Original Series Clean Slate: Cancelled on Prime Video; No Season Two for Laverne Cox Comedy Series More...
