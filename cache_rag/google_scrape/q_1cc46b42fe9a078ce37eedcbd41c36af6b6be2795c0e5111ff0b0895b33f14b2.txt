The Oklahoma State guard averaged 20.1 points, 6.2 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game and was named first-team All-American last season. He was a threat in multiple areas, shooting 40 percent from three-point range while showing elite passing ability. But the draft will be anything but predictable after Cunningham lands with the Pistons at No. 1. Jalen Green is one of the top scoring prospects of the last decade. Evan Mobley is a two-way center stud. Jalen Suggs is a powerful guard with top college experience. All will be selected after Cunningham in some order. The hometown Nets – the NBA Draft will be hosted at Barclays Center – will be drafting at No. 27, while the crosstown Knicks have the 19th and 21st selections. The Pistons are expected to take Cade Cunningham No. 1 overall in the 2021 NBA Draft. Getty Images So, how will it all unfold? Here’s how to watch The 2021 NBA Draft: When is The 2021 NBA Draft?
