God of War system requirements aren't exactly lightweight, but Santa Monica's God of War PC specs will help you run the Nordic adventure and achieve the right settings. If your gaming PC meets the God of War minimum system requirements , you should be able to run the action-adventure game at 720p with Low settings, with an average frame rate of 30fps. You'll need a processor as powerful as an Intel i5-2500K or AMD Ryzen 3 1200 CPU paired with an Nvidia GTX 960 (4GB) or AMD R9 290X (4GB) GPU. This is the only skew that lists an HDD, but an SSD is still recommended, but you'll need 70GB of space either way. Meeting the God of War recommended system requirements means you'll get the same quality as the PS4 at 1080p / 30fps. Storage and RAM requirements remain the same, but you'll need a processor as beefy as an Intel i5-6600K or AMD Ryzen 5 2400G. On the graphics card front, you'll need something as strong as an Nvidia GTX 1060 (6GB) or AMD RX 570 (4GB). The God of War high system requirements aren't Herculean by any means, but if your PC can match them, you can crank your frames up to 60. An i7-4770K or an AMD Ryzen 7 2700 is more than enough processor power for this skew, with an Nvidia GTX 1070 (8GB) and AMD RX 5600 XT (6GB) acting as a reliable video companion. As we approach the peak, stopping off at the God of War performance system requirements , you can expect PS5 levels of detail and performance, with an average frame rate of 60fps with a 1440p resolution. Given our ascent, it's understandable that the hardware requirements are much higher, with Santa Monica Studios suggesting a CPU equivalent to an Intel i7-7700K or AMD Ryzen 7 3700X with 16GB of RAM. In terms of a GPU, an Nvidia RTX 2070 (8GB) or AMD RX 5700 XT (8GB) is necessary to enjoy the increased detail on PC. Only the beefiest rigs will meet the God of War ultra system requirements , where you can expect 60fps at 4K resolution using ultra settings. To wield such power, you must seek out an Intel i9-9900K or AMD Ryzen 9 3950X processor and an Nvidia RTX 3080 (10GB) or AMD RX 6800 XT (16GB) graphics card.

God of War update 1.0.12 God of War Update 1.0.12 arrived in May 2022, and was the final substantial update to be delivered to the game. The 1.0.12 update had the potential to make all the difference if you were experiencing God of War PC performance issues. According to Santa Monica's patch notes, the update included FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0, which enabled resolution scaling and helped improve your frame rate. It also fixed the toggle aim/block accessibility feature to be more consistent. The very last update to be released to God of War was the 1.0.13 update in May 2023, but the patch only added additional third-party software to the game's credits, and introduced no further changes. God of War Ragnarok PC It'd be pretty strange not to see God of War Ragnarok come to PC now that the original game is available to Steam fans, but PlayStation has yet to confirm whether it's porting the sequel. We're still waiting for older exclusives like Bloodborne to make the cut, but the studio has generally been pretty good at bringing its latest games to Windows. Since God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Days Gone, Marvel's Spider-Man, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and even Sackboy: A Big Adventure are now available platform, it seems likely that  God of War Ragnarok PC will eventually be its own thing, but we might need to wait a while. The original God of War joined PC two years after it released on PlayStation 4, so our best guess is that we'll see Ragnarok in 2024. For minimum system and recommended specs, check the latest news on the God of War Ragnarok PC requirements. God of War will run on PC system with Windows 10 64-bit and upwards.
