She engages the rich diverse cultures and 38 spoken languages to achieve a vision where every child thrives to “Believe, Achieve, Succeed, and Dream Big!” A graduate of the University of Hawaii with a Bachelor  of elementary education and a public-school educator for 31 years, Kwee has had an enormous impact on the lives of many keiki (children). She is a life-changer who empowers students and fosters students’ self-discovery, success, and growth. A highlight in Kwee’s life is being named a National LifeChanger (2018-2019) by National Life Group for her anti-bullying work with students. Through active inquiry, students discovered forgiveness, love, compassion, and ways to manage their emotions. Her students engage in student-led learning projects based on their interests and curiosities, and they explore how kindness affects health and well-being. Kwee is an avid yoga enthusiast with a keen interest in health and well-being and extended her passion to teaching her students and fellow teachers yoga to enhance social and emotional well-being. Kwee and her students have created a business, #Sharealoha, to promote kindness and aloha (fellowship); to raise funds to build a student-designed Ala Wai School ‘peaceful oasis,’ they created and sell unique Jars of Aloha, #Sharealoha t-shirts, and face masks. Kwee desires to inspire others to live with empathy and compassion in service to create a more peaceful world, and believes in the power of relationships, student voice, and service.
