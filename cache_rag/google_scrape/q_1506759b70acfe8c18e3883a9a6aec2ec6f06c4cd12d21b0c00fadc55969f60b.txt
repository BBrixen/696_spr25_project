Fixed an issue in Skipper Pavilion in which it was possible to enter the opposing team’s base by transferring between certain grates. Other Changes We observed changes after distribution of Ver 5.4.0 and made additional adjustments to slightly lower the fighting power of certain weapons that could hold the battle line from further away. Also, we made adjustments to narrow the margins by which certain weapons were strengthened in Ver 5.4.0 while also lowering the frequency at which special weapons can  be triggered. At the same time, we expanded weapon choice by increasing the abilities of certain weapons that excel at closer ranges. In addition, we reviewed some of the weapons that previously had their capabilities lowered, and as a result we slightly reverted some of the lowered values and made some adjustments to points required for special weapons. We will observe the changes after this update and make further adjustments to Splatoon 2 in the future. When you download the latest update data, you will no longer be able to communicate in The Shoal with players using older update data. This update also includes changes not listed here, such as improvements to the gameplay experience.

Other Changes We observed changes after distribution of Ver 5.3.0 and made adjustments to slightly lower the fighting power of certain weapons that could hold the battle line over a long period of time from further away compared to other weapons. In addition, in order increase the variety of weapons being selected, we made adjustments to several weapons to increase their competitiveness with the most popular weapons. We will observe the changes after this update and make further adjustments to Splatoon 2 in the future. When you download the latest update data, you will no longer be able to communicate in The Shoal with players using older update data. This update also includes changes not listed here, such as improvements to the gameplay experience. Sufficient space on the internal system memory or a microSD card is required to download the update. Save data will still be available for use after downloading the update. Ver. 5.3.1 (Released Oct 27, 2020) Changes to Ranked Battles Adjusted settings for X Rank battles so that during times when there are many players online, players with high X Power will be more likely to match with each other. Further changes may be made depending on how the situation develops. Made it so that for X Rank battles, other players’ names are not displayed on the screen while waiting for players to join. Made it so that for X Rank battles, you may battle with someone even if they’re blocked via console settings if that player’s estimated rank is within the top 2,000. Changes to Splatfests Made it so that in Pro-mode Splatfest Battles, other players’ names are not displayed on the screen while waiting for players to join when Splatfest Power is considerably high. Made it so that in Pro-mode Splatfest Battles, you may battle someone even if they’re blocked via the console settings if that player’s Splatfest Power is considerably high. In X Rank Battles and Pro-mode Splatfest Battles, X Power and Splatfest Power serve an important role in determining who you match with and your order in the ranking. To calculate those values correctly, it’s important that opponents are chosen without any deviation, and therefore we utilize a system that detects improper Power manipulation based on match data. Suspect data is manually scrutinized, and if it is determined that improper behavior is conclusively evident, that month’s records will be invalidated, and a penalty will be applied in accordance with the Nintendo Account User Agreement. Additionally, these systems are updated daily. We are addressing this type of improper behavior, but incidents of users improperly manipulating Power by intentionally limiting their opponents are extremely few when compared to the whole, though they are occasionally detected. Therefore, in order to allow users to play Ranked Battles and Pro-mode Splatfests without worrying about this behavior, we believe it’s important to not only refine the systems to detect improper behavior but also to make it difficult to carry out this kind of behavior, and so we have prepared this update. Please note that we will continue to make adjustments to things such as weapons after long-term analysis of the data. When you download the latest update data, you will no longer be able to communicate in The Shoal with players using older update data. This update also includes changes not listed here, such as improvements to the gameplay experience. Sufficient space on the internal system memory or a microSD card is required to download the update. Save data will still be available for use after downloading the update. Ver. 5.3.0 (Released August 18, 2020) Changes to Multiplayer Specifications for some of the main weapons have been changed. Weapon Change Splattershot Tentatek Splattershot Kensa Splattershot Hero Shot Replica Octo Shot Replica Reduced the amount of time it takes for shot spread (which is the gradual distance shots spread away from the target when firing continuously) to return to normal. Most Shooter-type weapons will have increased shot spread if you continuously fire. When you stop firing, the shot spread gradually returns to normal, but with this fix, we’ve reduced the amount of time it takes to return. .52 Gal .52 Gal Deco Kensa .52 Gal Extended the amount of time when firing continuously until shot spread reaches its max. Reduced the amount of time it takes for shot spread to return to normal. Most Shooter-type weapons will have increased shot spread if you continuously fire. When you stop firing, the shot spread gradually returns to normal, but with this fix, we’ve reduced the amount of time it takes to return. Bamboozler 14 Mk I Bamboozler 14 Mk II Bamboozler 14 Mk III Increased ink consumption by roughly 20%. Dualie Squelchers Custom Dualie Squelchers Increased the ink consumed by rolling from 5% to 8% of the Ink Tank. Very slightly decreased the size of hit detection between normal shots and players, making it harder to hit opponents. There are no changes to hit detection between players and shots after rolling. Splat Brella Sorella Brella Hero Brella Replica Decreased damage dealt by each ink droplet from 18.0 to 16.2. Due to this change, the maximum damage dealt by a single shot has gone down from 90.0 to 81.0. As a result of closely observing the changes in weapon choice after ver. 5.2.0 was released, we made adjustments to certain weapons that were still being used often or were often used by players of the highest rank, even after the changes in weapon choice evened out. We’ve also made adjustments to improve those weapons that players started using a lot more often (and those with similar features) to give players more options. We plan to perform a long-term analysis after this update is applied and make adjustments based on that. Ver. 5.2.2 (Released June 30, 2020) Changes to Multiplayer Made it so players are unable to dive into ink on a wall and move along an unintended path in the time between using a Booyah Bomb and returning to the ground. Fixed an issue in Starfish Mainstage in which players could invade the opposing team’s base if they jumped at the right time on top of a certain part of chain-link fencing. Ver. 5.2.1 (Released June 15, 2020) Changes to Multiplayer Fixed an issue where if the player had Dualie-type weapons equipped, they could travel farther in the air than intended when dodge-rolling, as the result of a certain combination of movements. Fixed an issue where the player could land in a different location than intended if they activated a Booyah Bomb and then quickly ended the effect. Ver. 5.2.0 (Released April 15, 2020) Specifications for some of the main weapons have been changed.

The area over which damage is dealt and the area which is inked by an exploding bubble depends on the size of the bubble. Points required for using specials have been changed for certain main weapons. Weapon Before After N-ZAP83 180 170 Custom Range Blaster 180 170 L-3 Nozzlenose 210 220 Foil Squeezer 180 190 Inkbrush Nouveau 160 180 The changes in this update are designed to lower the abilities of a portion of all weapons and specials that, based on analysis of statistical data, had obtained an advantage in results. Our intention is that this will entice players to explore these weapons, while retaining their individual strengths of the weapons in scenarios where they are advantageous. We reference various sorts of statistical data for these adjustments, but in particular for those which lower the abilities of certain weapons, we've focused on data from matches between players of high Rank. We will issue future updates after looking carefully at changes resulting from this update, as well as the overall state of statistical data over the long term. Other Changes Changed the unlock conditions for Tracks #20 through #26 in Squid Beatz 2 so that anyone can play them. Extended the time limit to play your next game after you repeatedly disconnect within a short period of time. This change will affect only those with frequent disconnects, less than 1% of all active players worldwide. The more frequent your disconnects over a short period of time, the longer the time limit to play your next game will be. When you download the latest update data, you will no longer be able to connect with players in The Shoal who have older update data.

Baller Decreased duration of active time from roughly 7 to roughly 6 seconds.

With this update we have made adjustments to the abilities of certain weapons to effectively hold the line of battle or to ink turf from afar. However, we have limited these adjustments in such a way that they should not affect weapon selection for players experienced with using these weapons. Following this update, we plan to consider similar adjustments for many other weapons going forward. Additionally, we will continue to watch for and analyze weapons that appear to have few or no drawbacks, and that also perform well against all other weapons. We plan to distribute the next update in late April 2020. Was this helpful?
