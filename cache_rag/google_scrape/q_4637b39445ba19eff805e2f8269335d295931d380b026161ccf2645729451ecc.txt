The Google Pixel 5a 5G effectively updates and replace the Pixel 4a 5G - you can see how these devices compare right here . Release date and price $449 Available now US and Japan only The Google Pixel 5a 5G costs $449 and is available from the Google Store, or through Google Fi. In Japan, it's available from Softbank, but won't be getting a full global release - it's US and Japan only. It started shipping from 26 August. Design 154.9 x 73.7 x 7.6mm, 185g Metal unibody Rear fingerprint sensor, punch hole front camera Mostly Black The Google Pixel 5a 5G follows a very similar design to the Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 rather than offering a redesign like the Pixel 6 devices. The means you have a familiar body shape with a square camera array top left on the rear and a rear fingerprint scanner. The dimensions of this phone make it a little larger than the Pixel 4a 5G that it replaces - and if you remember, that device is larger than the Pixel 5 too, so the new model is the largest of the lot. An interesting and premium addition is the IP67 waterproofing, which is less common on mid-range devices, so that certainly adds appeal to the Pixel 5a 5G offering. There's also a 3.5mm headphone socket. It comes in one colour called Mostly Black, which has forest green undertones. There's a contrasting olive green power button on the side. What's interesting is that this phone acutally has a metal unibody rather than the polycarbonate of the Pixel 4a 5G. Display 6.34-inch, 2400 x 1080 pixels OLED, 60Hz The display on the Pixel 5a 5G doesn't change a huge amount from the Pixel 4a 5G. It's a little larger, but sticks to 60Hz (unlike the Pixel 5) and keeps the full HD+ resolution. It's still an OLED display, however, so you can expect that rich colouration to make all your content look good. There's a punch hole for the front cameras, as on the other recent Pixel devices. Cameras Dual rear cameras: Main: 12.2MP, 1.4Œºm, f/1.7, OIS Ultrawide: 16MP, 1.0Œºm, f/2.2 Front: 8MP, 1.12Œºm, f/2.0 fixed focus The camera loadout on the Pixel 5a 5G is a carbon copy of that found on the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5, with a 12.2-megapixel main camera and 16-megapixel ultrawide camera. An 8-megapixel front camera is in place for all your selfies. The Pixel camera is popular and the 5a 5G will be no different, because it offers all those great features you expect from a Pixel, like Night Sight. The best thing about these cameras is you point, shoot and get a decent result. Hardware and specs Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G 5G, 6GB RAM 128GB storage 4620mAh battery The Google Pixel 5a 5G sits on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G, which is the same as the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G. There is 6GB of RAM, which again is the same as the Pixel 4a 5G and 4a offer. There is 128GB of storage, so overall, the performance is essentially going to be the same as the existing devices - except this model is cheaper than both. Battery capacity is 4620mAh, which is quite a bit bigger than the Pixel 4a 5G offers with its 3800mAh cell, so endurance is going to be one of the big features of this phone. There's an 18W charger in the box. Google Pixel 5a rumours: What's happened in the run up to launch?
