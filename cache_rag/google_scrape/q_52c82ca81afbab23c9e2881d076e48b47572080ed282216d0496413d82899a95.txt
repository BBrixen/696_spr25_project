The IOC upgraded original silver medalist Adam Nelson ( USA ) to gold, bronze medalist Joachim Olsen ( DEN ) to silver, and fourth place finisher Manuel Martínez ( ESP ) to bronze. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] b Adrian Annus ( HUN ) and Ivan Tsikhan ( BLR ) were disqualified due to doping. [ 1 ] IOC decided to declare the silver and bronze medals vacant. [ 3 ] c Crystal Cox ( USA ), who ran in the preliminary round of a relay team, admitted to using anabolic steroids from 2001 to 2004. The IOC decided to revoke the gold medal from Crystal Cox and asked the IAAF to make its decision about the US squad. The IOC and IAAF announced that the result would stand because, according to the rules of the time, a team should not be disqualified because of a doping offense by an athlete who did not compete in finals. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] d Russian athlete Irina Korzhanenko lost her gold medal in women's shot put due to doping, with Cuban Yumileidi Cumbá Jay replacing her as the Olympic champion, German Nadine Kleinert receiving the silver medal, and Svetlana Krivelyova of Russia receiving the bronze medal, [ 6 ] however Krivelyova was later stripped of her bronze for the same reason. IOC decided to declare the bronze medal vacant. [ 7 ] e Iryna Yatchenko ( BLR ), was disqualified due to doping. The IOC decided that the bronze medal was reallocated to the athlete Věra Pospíšilová-Cechlová ( CZE ) during the IOC Executive Board on 30 May 2013.
