Photograph: Nigel French/PA Share Updated at 14.51 EDT 14 Jul 2018 13.00 EDT Williams comes into the press conference room . On Kerber : “She played from the first point to the last point really good. She played unbelievable.” On the late start time : “It definitely didn’t have any impact on me. It was a necessary evil that had to be done, [the men] had to finish their match. It was probably the only way to schedule it.” On reaching the final: “It was a great opportunity for me. I didn’t know a couple of months ago where I was, and so these two weeks have showed me I can really compete and be a contender to win grand slams. This is literally just the beginning. I took a giant step at Wimbledon but my journey has just began.” Share Updated at 13.08 EDT 14 Jul 2018 12.57 EDT A mark of Kerber’s consistency : she hit only five unforced errors during the whole match. And Williams, only four tournaments and 14 matches into her comeback, just didn’t have the stamina to stay with her. It was over after only an hour and five minutes but, for Williams, the way she was tugged around court, it will surely have felt longer. Would happily have seen a third (and fourth and fifth) set of that Kerber vs. Williams final. Surely ideal situation is now best-of-3 during first 4 rounds for both men and women, and then best-of-5 for the last 2 or 3 rounds - both genders. Tie-breaks in final sets. #Wimbledon — David Law (@DavidLawTennis) July 14, 2018 Share Updated at 13.08 EDT 14 Jul 2018 12.47 EDT Kerber is looking at her name , which is already painted on the winners’ board.

Coming back, you’re such an inspiration for everyone. I’m sure you will have your next grand slam title soon, so congrats for coming back. “I knew I had to play my best tennis against Serena. It’s my second chance [in the final]. I’m the next German after Steffi to win, it’s amazing.” Share 14 Jul 2018 12.31 EDT Trophy time . Williams trudges up first to collect the runners-up plate, followed by Kerber, who holds aloft the Venus Rosewater dish. “It was such an amazing tournament for me,” says Williams, her voice breaking. “I was really happy to get this far. It’s obviously disappointing but I can’t be disappointed. I’m literally just getting started. Sue Barker tells Williams she’s a “superhero supermum”. Williams holds back the tears again, before replying: “For all the mums out there, I was playing for you today, I tried. Angelique played out of her mind. She’s an incredible person and a really good friend so I’m really happy for her.” View image in fullscreen Angelique Kerber, left, holds the winner’s trophy, the Venus Rosewater Dish, after her women’s singles final victory over Serena Williams, who holds the runner’s up plate. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images Share Updated at 14.55 EDT 14 Jul 2018 12.27 EDT So history eludes Williams this afternoon – she’ll have to wait until the US Open to attempt to equal Margaret Court’s all-time record of 24 grand slam titles, but Kerber has written her own history. She’s the first German to win Wimbledon since her childhood hero Steffi Graf in 1996, and this Wimbledon crown adds to the Australian Open and US Open titles she won in 2016. Share Updated at 12.49 EDT 14 Jul 2018 12.24 EDT Kerber is the Wimbledon champion with a 6-3, 6-3 victory! So Kerber is serving for her first Wimbledon title. 15-0, 30-0, when Williams storms forward to the drive volley but inexplicably fires long! She’s down on her knees, despairing. A lengthy duel on the third point, Williams decides she doesn’t want to do any more running and a delicate drop shot settles matters. 30-15. A tight second serve from Kerber and Williams loosens up, pinging the cross-court return. 30-all. 40-30, championship point , after Kerber’s effort grazes the baseline! And Kerber becomes the Wimbledon champion for the first time when Williams’s return flops into the net! Kerber tumbles to the grass, Williams graciously walks to the other side of the court to congratulate the champion, and Kerber is now blowing kisses to the stands. She then decides to do a Pat Cash by going to the players’ box, embracing, among others, Wim Fissette, the former coach of Konta, Azarenka and Clijsters, who’s done such a great job of turning around her form this year. He’s played a big part in this win. View image in fullscreen Angelique Kerber celebrates her victory over Serena Williams.

Photograph: John Walton/Pool/EPA Share Updated at 14.51 EDT 14 Jul 2018 12.14 EDT Second set: *Kerber 6-3, 4-2 Williams (*denotes next server) Kerber is the highest-ranked player Williams has played this tournament and it shows. Because this is Williams and we expect so much of her, it’s easy to forget this is only her fourth tournament back and it’s only 10 months ago that she gave birth to her daughter. To put it into perspective: Kim Clijsters was the last player to win a grand slam after becoming a mother, at the US Open in 2009. But her daughter wasn’t so young and Clijsters says there’s no way she could have come back as soon as Williams has. Kerber, meanwhile, is charging around the court and fires a forehand down the line for 15-40, two break points. And on the second she sends another clean winner to almost exactly the same spot! Kerber is in command. Share 14 Jul 2018 12.08 EDT Second set: Kerber 6-3, 3-2 Williams* (*denotes next server) Williams hauls herself to deuce from 40-0 down. But a cry from Williams when Kerber claims the next two points to hold. They’re still on serve in this second set but Williams does not look comfortable. Kerber is playing with such consistency and Williams is very up and down. Share 14 Jul 2018 12.04 EDT Second set: *Kerber 6-3, 2-2 Williams (*denotes next server) At 40-30 on Williams’s serve, Anna Wintour is biting her nails in the players’ box. She needn’t have looked so worried because Williams holds. But Williams is sucking for air here, Kerber is doing such a good job of dragging her all around the court. Kerber is the first top defensive player Williams has played this tournament and Williams is finding it hard to keep up. Share 14 Jul 2018 12.00 EDT Second set: Kerber 6-3, 2-1 Williams* (*denotes next server) Williams is willing herself to produce more here. The crowd are doing their best to encourage her too. They want a third set, of course, but I think there’s more to it than that, there’s a real desire for Williams to win the trophy. It would be such an inspirational story, plus she’s won even more fans than she already had by talking so candidly in her off-court interviews and on social media about motherhood and the troubles she’s had over the past year. Williams is pushing at 15-30 but then throws in the strangest of shots when, at the net, she plays pat-a-cake with a smash. Perhaps the ball dropped lower than she was expecting. Kerber holds to 30.

Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images Share Updated at 14.52 EDT 14 Jul 2018 11.55 EDT Second set: *Kerber 6-3, 1-1 Williams (*denotes next server) An ominous stat for Williams: in their previous eight meetings, the player who has won the first set has gone on to win the match. She’s looking uncomfortable at 15-30, Kerber is getting so many balls back, but Williams fist pumps and urges herself to the next three points, the highlight an excellent drop volley. Share 14 Jul 2018 11.52 EDT Second set: Kerber 6-3, 1-0 Williams* (*denotes next server) Kerber clearly hasn’t read the script. This afternoon was supposed to be about Williams further enhancing her greatness. That could still happen, of course, but Kerber is showing no signs of easing off at the start of the second set. She holds to 15. Share 14 Jul 2018 11.50 EDT Discount Serena at your peril...but a sense that SW is finally confronting the weight of the occasion. Down 3-6. — Jon Wertheim (@jon_wertheim) July 14, 2018 Share 14 Jul 2018 11.49 EDT Kerber wins the first set 6-3! Williams misses a makable volley on the second point and it’s 0-30. She’s potentially two points away from conceding the first set. She puts away a drive volley, that will have felt good. Can she build on that? Yes – but it was touch and go – Kerber attempts the lob with Williams close to the net and it goes just long. 30-all. 30-40, after a mistimed groundstroke. Set point . Williams rams a high backhand into the net and Kerber secures the set! She’s doing a great job of neutralising Williams’s power and hit only three unforced errors in that set. What German efficiency.

Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters Share Updated at 14.47 EDT 14 Jul 2018 11.44 EDT First set: Kerber 5-3 Williams* (*denotes next server) There’s nothing Williams hates more than being broken. She often retaliates immediately. She’s pushing at 30-all here, Kerber is living a little dangerously, but survives when Williams’s effort whistles wide. 40-30. Game. Share 14 Jul 2018 11.41 EDT First set: *Kerber 4-3 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams’s movement is so impressive so early into her comeback. She’s forced to cover several blades of grass on the opening point but it’s Kerber who wins it. 0-15. A first double fault, 0-30. And there’s another! Two in a row, that’s extremely rare from Williams. 0-40. Keen to make amends, she sends down a smash on the first break point and Kerber hits an air shot. An unreturned serve out wide on the second break point. But it’s third time lucky for Kerber, when Williams goes long! Another jolting change in momentum. After Kerber’s early charge, and Williams’s response, it’s now Kerber in the ascendancy again. Share 14 Jul 2018 11.35 EDT First set: Kerber 3-3 Williams* (*denotes next server) But Kerber sees Williams’s attack and raises it with some superb defence. A fizzing forehand down the line and a beautiful backhand down the line and it’s 40-0 Kerber. 40-15. Kerber holds from there. View image in fullscreen It’s a packed house on the Centre Court. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters Share Updated at 12.02 EDT 14 Jul 2018 11.33 EDT First set: *Kerber 2-3 Williams (*denotes next server) Pow. A 125mph ace from Williams – the fastest of the women’s tournament – seals the game to love. That’s as fast as they were serving in the men’s semi-final. From 2-0 down Williams takes three games on the spin to lead this final for the first time. Share 14 Jul 2018 11.30 EDT First set: Kerber 2-2 Williams* (*denotes next server) Other names in the Royal Box this afternoon include Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova, Virginia Wade, Emma Watson and Thandie Newton, while Tiger Woods and Lewis Hamilton are guests in the Williams box. Nods of approval when Williams ups the ante, stepping into court and stepping up the power. 0-15. 0-30. 0-40. Three break points. Kerber clatters a backhand long and Williams is back on level terms. Share 14 Jul 2018 11.26 EDT First set: *Kerber 2-1 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams will feel less wobbly after getting on the board with a hold to 30. She settles the game with an arrow of a backhand down the line. Cue applause from Meghan. Williams was a guest at the royal wedding in May (and, ever the competitor, reportedly beat the other guests in a game of beer pong), and now it’s the Duchess of Sussex’s turn to support her friend. The Duchess of Cambridge is also in the Royal Box this afternoon. Royalty watching tennis royalty. Share 14 Jul 2018 11.23 EDT First set: Kerber 2-0 Williams* (*denotes next server) If Kerber is able to engage Williams in plenty of long exchanges – like she did on that break point – she has a real chance of beating Williams. The German’s looking so calm, gliding to 40-15, while Williams is left chastising herself after hitting long on game point. Kerber consolidates the break. Share 14 Jul 2018 11.20 EDT First set: *Kerber 1-0 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams starts her chase for another piece of history by taking the opening point. And the second, when Kerber clunks long. Williams lands her third consecutive first serve but goes on to tug a backhand wide. 30-15. 30-all after another backhand error from Williams, a tight shot which drops right into the bottom of the net. Kerber carves out an early break point. 30-40. Williams goes for the one-two punch but Kerber soaks up the pressure, showing tremendous defence in a long rally, and Williams whacks a forehand into the net! Kerber gets off to the perfect start with the break! View image in fullscreen Serena Williams fires a shot to Angelique Kerber. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters Share Updated at 12.01 EDT 14 Jul 2018 11.15 EDT This is a great clash in styles : puncher v counterpuncher, power v speed, the best server of the tournament v the best receiver. Kerber will need to mix things up with plenty of slice, short balls and slow balls to disrupt Williams’s rhythm. With all the top-10 seeds going out, this is arguably the best match-up we could have had. “We had so many great matches in the last years,” said Kerber in the build-up to this final. “To seeing her back, it’s great. Yeah, I know that she is always pushing you to the limits to play your best tennis. This is the only chance to beat her.” Share 14 Jul 2018 11.11 EDT Tik! Tok! Tikity! Tok! They’re warming up . As for their head-to-head, Williams leads 6-2 but Kerber won’t be scared; she has defeated the American at a grand slam before, in the 2016 Australian Open final.

Williams, headphones on, strides ahead of her opponent. They’re both given a bouquet of flowers before walking on court to a tremendous ovation. The camera pans to Meghan Markle for the first of probably 783 times this afternoon. Most spectators have returned to their seats having taken a break after Djokovic’s win. Share Updated at 11.09 EDT 14 Jul 2018 11.04 EDT The players should be on court very soon. While we wait, some highlights of the 2016 Wimbledon final between Williams and Kerber: Share 14 Jul 2018 10.59 EDT A cut and paste of my preamble from earlier if you haven’t read it: Ten months ago Serena Williams suffered life-threatening complications after giving birth to her daughter, Olympia. Today the 36-year-old reaches for an eighth Wimbledon title that would equal Margaret Court’s all-time record of 24 grand slam wins. Only 10 months ago . It’s worth repeating. Williams has made a habit of making the seemingly impossible possible during her career, so perhaps it’s easy to underestimate the difficulty of what she’s achieved by reaching the final. The American was bedridden for six weeks after an emergency caesarean section last September and needed several procedures after blood clots settled on her lungs. “It’s no secret I had a super tough delivery,” Williams said after her semi-final win on Thursday. “I lost count after, like, four surgeries. It was just routine every day. There was a time I could barely walk to my mailbox. A lot of people were saying: ‘Oh, she should be in the final.’ For me it’s such a pleasure and a joy because less than a year ago I was going through so much.” In her fourth tournament back, she has looked fit and focused with a fierce desire to win the title for her daughter, gaining momentum with every match and dropping only one set. These aren’t baby steps she’s taking, these are giant strides. But Angelique Kerber is determined to be more than a footnote in Williams’s Wimbledon story; the German has her own comeback to cap. Kerber enjoyed a superb 2016, winning the Australian and US Opens and finishing runner-up at Wimbledon (she played Williams in both the Australian and Wimbledon finals). She rose to No 1 in the world but seemed to regard her status as a millstone round her neck rather than a milestone. Weighed down by the expectation and attention, she slumped last year, but is now close to her 2016 form. The 11 th seed has gone under the Wimbledon radar slightly because of all the headline-grabbing shocks around her but she withstood everything Jelena Ostapenko threw at her in the semi-finals and is determined to show she isn’t a one-season wonder.

Sorry for screwing the schedule up today 😳 pic.twitter.com/qlbFcoyl6z — John Isner (@JohnIsner) July 14, 2018 Share 14 Jul 2018 09.39 EDT Much has been said since last night about rights and wrongs of the scheduling . A final without a set start time is hard on Williams and Kerber, who have worked so hard to get here. But because Djokovic and Nadal started on Centre, they have to finish there. Given one of them has to play again tomorrow, it wasn’t really an option for them to come on after the women. And after last night’s 11pm finish, they couldn’t have resumed any earlier than 1pm. Perhaps what can be learned from this is that fifth-set tie-breaks must be considered by Wimbledon . If Anderson v Isner had been settled at that stage rather than at 26-24, we wouldn’t be in this mess today.

A lot of people were saying: ‘Oh, she should be in the final.’ For me it’s such a pleasure and a joy because less than a year ago I was going through so much.” In her fourth tournament back, she has looked fit and focused with a fierce desire to win the title for her daughter, gaining momentum with every match and dropping only one set. These aren’t baby steps she’s taking, these are giant strides. But Angelique Kerber is determined to be more than a footnote in Williams’s Wimbledon story; the German has her own comeback to cap. Kerber enjoyed a superb 2016, winning the Australian and US Opens and finishing runner-up at Wimbledon (she played Williams in both the Australian and Wimbledon finals). She rose to No 1 in the world but seemed to regard her status as a millstone round her neck rather than a milestone. Weighed down by the expectation and attention, she slumped last year, but is now close to her 2016 form. The 11 th seed has gone under the Wimbledon radar slightly because of all the headline-grabbing shocks around her but she withstood everything Jelena Ostapenko threw at her in the semi-finals and is determined to show she isn’t a one-season wonder. The final was supposed to get under way at : 2pm BST. It will now start whenever Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal stop taking lumps out of each other in the second part of their semi-final .
