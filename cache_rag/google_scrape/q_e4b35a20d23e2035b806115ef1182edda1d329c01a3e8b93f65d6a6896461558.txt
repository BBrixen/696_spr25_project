Produced by 20th Century Studios and distributed by Lightstorm Entertainment , it consists of associated merchandise, video games, and theme park attractions. [ 1 ] Avatar is set in the mid-22nd century on Pandora , a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system. The films' central conflict is between the indigenous Na'vi led by Jake Sully and Neytiri , and humans led by Colonel Miles Quaritch from the Resources Development Administration (RDA) , a megacorp which has arrived on Pandora to colonize and pillage it for its natural resources. The title of the series refers to the genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain that humans pilot to interact with on Pandora. The first installment, Avatar , was released on December 18, 2009, and is the highest grossing motion picture of all-time when ticket price inflation is not considered. The second installment, The Way of Water , was released on December 16, 2022. The planned sequel series was announced by 20th Century Fox on December 11, 2009, one week before Avatar was released to theaters. 20th Century Fox had confirmed the series on January 15, 2010. The Avatar franchise is one of the most expensive franchises undertaken , with the combined budget of the first film and its four sequels estimated at $1 billion. The franchise has grossed more than $5.2 billion worldwide; it is the 15th-highest-grossing film series of all time. Like the original film, the four sequels have "fully encapsulated" stand-alone plots that "come to their own conclusions". The four films have an overarching meta-narrative that connects them to create a large interconnected saga. [ 2 ] Cameron described the sequels as "a natural extension of all the themes, and the characters, and the spiritual undercurrents" of the first film.

The story focuses on an epic conflict on Pandora , an inhabited Earth-sized moon of Polyphemus, one of three gas giants orbiting Alpha Centauri A . On Pandora, human colonists and the sentient humanoid indigenous inhabitants of Pandora, the Na'vi , engage in a war over the planet's resources (such as unobtanium ) and the latter's continued existence. The film's title refers to the remotely controlled, genetically engineered human-Na'vi bodies used by the film's human characters to interact with the natives. [ 3 ] The protagonist, Jake Sully , is a paraplegic young man who travels to Pandora from Earth. Assisting the corporate monolith known as the Resources Development Administration (RDA) , he is given an avatar which he uses to interact with the story's heroine, Neytiri , as well as her clan known as the Omatikaya.

Set over a decade after the events of the first film, The Way of Water focuses on the return of the RDA, which prompts Jake's family to seek refuge in the water regions of Pandora in an effort to keep one another safe. Cameron said in an interview that while the first film was about the "awe and wonder", the sequel focuses more on the characters. The film was originally planned for a December 2014 release, but was delayed several times and released on December 16, 2022. Production began in August 2017. It wrapped in September 2020.

Fire and Ash started shooting simultaneously with The Way of Water in New Zealand on September 25, 2017; filming was completed in late December 2020. The film will introduce a new aggressive Na'vi clan known as 'Ash People' who reside near volcanoes.

[ 10 ] Avatar 4 (2029) [ edit ] Main article: Avatar 4 A fourth film is planned for release on December 21, 2029.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] However, in January 2024, Cameron said that he will not start filming the remainder of Avatar 4 until after the release of Avatar: Fire and Ash . [ 11 ] Cameron stated that Avatar: The Tulkun Rider is being considered as a possible title for the fourth film. [ 9 ] Avatar 5 (2031) [ edit ] A fifth and final film has been announced and is scheduled for December 19, 2031.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] The themed land is set generations after the events of the films and features two attractions: Avatar Flight of Passage , a flying simulator attraction, and Na'vi River Journey , a boat dark ride . [ citation needed ] Avatar Land [ edit ] In February 2023, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that a new attraction based on the Avatar films, named the Avatar Experience, would open at Disneyland . [ 64 ] In August 2024, it was announced that the Avatar land will be built at Disney California Adventure . The land will be inspired by The Way of Water (2022), its upcoming sequel Fire and Ash (2025), and future Avatar films. [ 65 ] Cultural impact [ edit ] Psychological impact [ edit ] An observable phenomenon [ 66 ] dubbed "post-Avatar depression (PAD), [ 67 ] "post-Avatar depression syndrome ( PADS )",  "Avatar depression syndrome" [ 68 ] or "Avatar blues" has been reported in the media, such as by CNN [ 69 ] [ 68 ] and The Guardian [ 66 ] for Avatar 1 and Avatar 2. [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] It was first brought up on Avatar websites and forums , such as in thousands of posts of people discussing their experience with depression after watching the first movie. [ 69 ] [ 68 ] It is not a recognized medical condition. [ 73 ] [ 66 ] It is a sentiment reported by some people after watching Avatar movies. Reported "symptoms" include sadness, [ 73 ] depression , a feeling of meaninglessness and a dissatisfaction with one's existence and the real world, [ 69 ] [ 74 ] and worries about the future of Earth and issues such as climate change . [ 66 ] [ 75 ] [ 71 ] One user reported suicide ideation in the hope of reincarnating in a world similar to Pandora. [ 73 ] [ 66 ] "Avatar blues" is thought to be caused by the longing for the utopian world and society of Pandora , [ 73 ] [ 67 ] which, unlike many other fictional settings, is a real-seeming alternate world . [ 76 ] By contrast, Earth, the human race, and life's complexity and problems appear gray and non-idyllic. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 68 ] People with "Avatar blues" say they really want to live in Pandora, or wish to escape reality for a virtual reality . [ 69 ] [ 66 ] One fan estimated that 10-20% of posters on Avatar forums reported experiencing it. [ 70 ] [ 66 ] [ 71 ] To cope with the depression, Psychology today advised to maintain realistic expectations for the real world and focus on its positive aspects like people and hobbies, [ 76 ] [ 73 ] while Avatar fans organized group meetings to sometimes talk about their struggle. [ 70 ] [ 66 ] Critics of the phenomenon argue that affected people may have already been melancholic or depressed before watching the movie, or that considering the large audience reach, some people were statistically going to become depressed. [ 74 ] A depression expert called it an insult to depressed people and did not consider it clinical depression. [ 68 ] Consideration of indigenous people [ edit ] Some indigenous groups, including Native Americans, have called for a boycott of the franchise over "tone-deaf" handling of indigenous cultures and cultural appropriation . Both Avatar films have drawn criticism for casting several white and other non-indigenous actors in the roles of the alien native people. Cameron said he tried to move away from a white savior narrative . [ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] The film series was criticized for "romanticization of colonization" and putting forward a monolithic portrayal of Indigenous people. [ 80 ] Cameron faced criticism for comments made after the release of the first film. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] In 2010, Cameron and Avatar actors supported the Xingu peoples in opposing the construction of the Belo Monte Dam . [ 81 ] In 2012, Cameron said Avatar is a fictional retelling of the history of North and South America in the early Colonial period, "with all its conflict and bloodshed between the military aggressors from Europe and the indigenous peoples". [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Notes [ edit ] ^ Starting with the 85th Academy Awards (2012), the Best Art Direction category was renamed Best Production Design. ^ Starting with the 93rd Academy Awards (2021), the Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing categories were consolidated into a single Best Sound category.
