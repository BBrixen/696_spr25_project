Members Online • Mr_RadicalCat When are you supposed to play the Phantom Liberty DLC? Question I'm aware that the Phantom Liberty DLC unlocks after reaching the Voodoo Boys, and that you can skip to Phantom Liberty immediately upon starting a new game. However, when exactly should you play through Phantom Liberty? Logic would say immediately upon unlocking it as Phantom Liberty is set during the main campaign, but I've see that Phantom Liberty affects the ending of the game? Or gives a new ending to the game, or something along those lines? I haven't finished the game once, planning on doing that when the 2.0 update drops. So should I wait with Phantom Liberty until after I beat the game or just immediately play the expansion when I unlock it? (I'm going to start a new game just to get back into the story and the swing of things) Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
