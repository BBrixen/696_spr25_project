In October ballots are sent out to voters, to collect nominations for the first award ceremonies, which are usually the Governors Awards or the independent Gotham Awards , to begin awards season in November. The season usually culminates in the Academy Awards in late February or early March (the latter in Winter Olympics years). In 2021, the season ended with the delayed Academy Awards ceremony on April 25, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic , with many other ceremonies and film festivals moving up their dates, in return. Though they only cover film scores and soundtrack albums /songs within their honors, several music awards , including the American Music Awards and Grammy Awards , are also presented during the same film awards season to provide television networks additional event programming .
