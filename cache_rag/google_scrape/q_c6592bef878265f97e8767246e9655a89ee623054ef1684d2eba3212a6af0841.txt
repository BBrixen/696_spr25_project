Walter Camp is the nation’s oldest and most prestigious collegiate football All-America team. The 2024 watch list includes 41 offensive players (20 quarterbacks, 11 running backs, five receivers/tight ends and two offensive lineman) along with nine from the defensive side of the ball. Players from 39 different schools representing 10 conferences (including independents) are represented on the preseason watch list.   Ohio State and Notre Dame each have three players on the watch list, while seven schools (Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Ole Miss and Penn State) each have two. In the AFCA Coaches' Preseason Poll released today, Ohio State was ranked No. 2 with 7 first-place votes while Georgia took the top slot after being ranked No. 1 on 46 ballots. Texas and Michigan each received 1 first-place vote. The Ohio State over/under win total is 10.5 with odds of -150 on the over and +120 on the under. With Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh off to the San Diego Chargers and new head coach Sherrone Moore facing NCAA allegations , the forecast for the Wolverines could turn more bleak. Michigan has the 4th-best odds of wining the B1G, a winner after taking home the national title in the CFP Championship Game . As of Monday, the Wolverines had the 10th-best National Championship odds. LSU quarterback Jayden Daneils was the 2023 Walter Camp Player of the Year and Heisman Trophy winner. He was also named Player of the Year by the AP and took home the Davey O'Brien Award for top quarterback, as well as the Johnny Unitas Award for top senior/graduate quarterback. “We are proud to continue the great work of Walter Camp and recognize the best college football players in the nation,” Foundation president John Barbarotta said. “This watch list is a great start to what is shaping up to be another exciting year of college football.” The 2024 Player of Year watch list will be narrowed to 10 semi-finalists in early November and three finalists will be announced on November 26.  The 2024 Walter Camp Player of the Year recipient, which is voted on by the 133 NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision head coaches and sports information directors, will be announced on ESPN’s College Football Awards Show on December 12.

Camp – a former Yale University athlete and football coach – is also credited with developing play from scrimmage, set plays, the numerical assessment of goals and tries and the restriction of play to eleven men per side. The Walter Camp Football Foundation ( www.waltercamp.org ) – a New Haven-based all-volunteer group – was founded in 1967 to perpetuate the ideals of Camp and to continue the tradition of selecting annually an All-America team. The Walter Camp Foundation is a member of the National College Football Awards Association. Founded in 1997, the NCFAA includes college football’s most prestigious awards and its 24 awards have honored more than 900 recipients dating back to 1935.
