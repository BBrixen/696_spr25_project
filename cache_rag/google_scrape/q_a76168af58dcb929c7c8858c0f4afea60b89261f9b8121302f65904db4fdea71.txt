You can use this thread for general discussion about the new game. Please remember to tag any spoilers here. Use spoiler flair when submitting a post that has anything spoiler related and, in addition, use Reddit’s built-in spoiler tag if you’re posting images to blur potentially spoilery thumbnail image of your post. Remember to not put spoilers in the post titles because spoiler tags don't work in post titles. Also, note that there are flairs made for Torna, so don’t use the Xenoblade 2 ones for Torna posts.
