Qatar's bid had centred on an appeal to Fifa to take "a bold gamble" by taking the World Cup to a region where football is popular and is beginning to emerge as world player in global sport. The victory will be viewed as a triumph for Mohammed Bin Hammam, the Fifa executive member, and president of the Asia Football Confederation, who is the favourite to succeed Blatter. The US could point to its pedigree of having already staged the 1994 World Cup, which drew vast crowds, plus commercial and financial guarantees, and the opportunity for Fifa to make further inroads into a country where baseball, basketball and the NFL still rule the sporting landscape. But despite concerns regarding the blistering heat it was Qatar who convinced the Fifa voters. "We know it would be a bold gamble and an exciting prospect but with no risk," the bid chief executive, Hassan Al-Thawadi, said. "Heat is not and will not be an issue." 2022 voting breakdown First round: Australia 1, Japan 3, USA 3, South Korea 4, Qatar 11 (Australia eliminated) Second round: Japan 2 votes, Korea Republic 5 votes, Qatar 10 votes and USA 5 votes (Japan eliminated) Third round: Korea Republic 5 votes, Qatar 11 votes, USA 6 votes (Korea Republic eliminated) Fourth round: Qatar 14 votes and USA 8 votes (Qatar obtained an absolute majority) Explore more on these topics World Cup 2022 World Cup news Share Reuse this content More on this story More on this story Farce as Fifa investigator Michael Garcia attacks ‘erroneous’ ethics report 13 Nov 2014 Fifa’s ethics report summary showcases a warped sense of integrity 13 Nov 2014 … … comments Fifa World Cup ethics report: all the reaction as it happened 13 Nov 2014 Fifa World Cup ethics report fallout shows naivety of England 2018 bid 13 Nov 2014 … … comments Fifa World Cup report: what the investigation made of each bid 13 Nov 2014 Fifa World Cup report: Michael Garcia, the lawyer in the eye of the storm 13 Nov 2014 Russia deny wrongdoing after Fifa 2018 inquiry finds evidence was destroyed 13 Nov 2014 Fifa appeals committee to consider Michael Garcia’s complaint 13 Nov 2014 Most viewed Most viewed Football Live scores Tables Fixtures Results Competitions Clubs News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Back to top © 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
