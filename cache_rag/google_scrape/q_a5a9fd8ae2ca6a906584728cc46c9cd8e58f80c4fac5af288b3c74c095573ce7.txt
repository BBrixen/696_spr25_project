Released in 2012, The Avengers is written and directed by Whedon, though Penn was able to maintain a story credit. The writer, who had penned The Incredible Hulk , had spent years working on The Avengers , as he was originally on board to write the screenplay himself. That changed when Whedon was hired as director in 2010, as his first order of business was to toss Penn's script. Reflecting on the situation in the new book MCU: The Reign of Marvel Studios , Penn shared the story behind getting replaced with Whedon, whom he described as rude and unpleasant throughout the whole ordeal.

Posts "All the other directors we had been talking about, Joss wasn't on the list," Penn explained. "I heard he was going to rewrite the script himself. He didn't even want to meet with me - which, by the way, I always call the writer I'm replacing. I feel like that's courtesy." Upon reaching out to Whedon personally, Penn added, "He said to me, 'No, it's not awkward for me. I'm rewriting you.' It became pretty apparent that he had less than zero interest in, in any way, having me involved with the movie." Zak Penn Didn't Know What to Tell His Kids Getting ousted from such a high-profile project was obviously frustrating in many ways, though Penn was particularly concerned how he'd break this news to his children. Unfortunately, Whedon allegedly didn't care. As Penn said, "My kids have grown up while I've been working on it. They've all told their friends about it. What's going to happen when their friends are like, 'Your dad didn't work on Avengers ?' [Whedon responded,] 'What's going to happen when my kids think that you wrote half the story?'"

Posts "I think he's a d*ck," Penn concluded. "I think he's a bad person, and it was really surprising. Remember, my bonus is based on my credit. So literally millions and millions of dollars, which is not the issue here, but that just came out of my pocket and went into Joss's pocket." Penn has since contributed to the screenplays for the hit films Ready Player One and Free Guy , as well as the superhero TV show Alphas . He also created the upcoming sci-fi thriller series Beacon 23 , which stars Lena Headey of Game of Thrones and is coming to MGM+ in November.
