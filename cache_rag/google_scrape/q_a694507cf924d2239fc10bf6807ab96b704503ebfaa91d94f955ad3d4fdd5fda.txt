The executive officers include the President and ten (10) Vice Presidents. The Executive Director is the principal administrative officer. The officers and the Executive Director are members of the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee manages and transacts the business and affairs of the NFLPA between meetings of the Board of Player Representatives. Executive officers are elected for a two-year term in even-numbered years at the annual meeting of the Board of Player Representatives. They must have been members in good standing for one-year to be eligible to serve.

He spent his first five seasons with the franchise, spent a year with the Houston Texans, and returned to Detroit in 2023. Reeves-Maybin became a player leader in 2021, when he was elected as Detroit’s first alternate, before running and being voted on to the NFLPA Executive Committee in 2022. In 2024, he was elected as the new President of the NFLPA. Oren Burks | Vice President The Vanderbilt University alum was selected in the third round of the 2018 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers and quickly got involved with the NFLPA. In 2020, Burks was elected first alternate rep for the Packers and became Community MVP for his work off the field that same season. He then signed with the San Francisco 49ers in 2022, where he became the team’s player representative. Now with the Philadelphia Eagles, Burks continues to work his way up the NFLPA leadership ladder after being voted onto the Executive Committee at the 2024 Board of Player Reps meeting. Calais Campbell | Vice President Since entering the NFL in 2008, the University of Miami graduate has been a defensive end for the Arizona Cardinals, Jacksonville Jaguars, Baltimore Ravens and Atlanta Falcons. As someone who understands the importance of knowing and exercising your rights as a player, Campbell has been immensely involved in NFLPA and a leader in the locker room. The five-time Pro Bowler has served as a player rep since 2018, was elected to the Executive Committee in 2020 and re-elected in 2022 and 2024. Off the field, Campbell has changed many lives for the good by giving back to his hometown and team cities. Alongside his mother and seven siblings, he started the CRC foundation in honor of his late father, Charles Richard Campbell, to enhance the local community through teaching critical skills to young people. He’s made multiple donations to several charitable initiatives during his time in the league, including $1.6 million to establish a scholarship fund for defensive lineman at his alma mater and his 2019 Season of Giving campaign, during which he raised nearly $75,000 through donations based on his on-field performance and donated $5,000 each to for Denver charities. For the latter initiative, he was named an NFLPA Community MVP and the NFL’s 2019 Walter Payton Man of the Year Award. Austin Ekeler | Vice President The Los Angeles Chargers running back, who was signed as an undrafted free agent in 2017, has been involved in the NFLPA since 2018. After serving as a first alternate, he was elected as the Chargers player rep in 2021 before being voted onto the Executive Committee in March 2022 and 2024. Off the field, Ekeler launched his own charity, the Austin Ekeler Foundation , which helps create opportunities for people to fulfill their passion and guide them through life. His organization has helped renovate a high school gym into a state-of-the-art fitness center, give back to the Los Angeles Downtown Women’s Center and provide five schools in Los Angeles with washers, dryers and detergent so that students can have clean clothes. Thomas Hennessy | Treasurer After going undrafted out of Duke, the long snapper signed with the Indianapolis Colts in 2017 before being traded a few months later to his current team, the New York Jets. Hennessy, the longest tenured player on the team, solidified his place in the Big Apple for several more years after signing a contract extension in 2023. Hennessy first served as the Jets’ second alternate in 2020 before being elected as the player rep in 2022. In March 2024, he ran for and was elected as the new treasurer of the NFLPA Executive Committee. Cameron Heyward | Vice President Named to six Pro Bowls, the Defensive Tackle from Ohio State was selected in the 2011 draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers and has spent his entire NFL career in Steel City. Heyward has been active in his union, serving as the Steelers team council in 2014, a first alternate in 2016 and a player rep in 2020 and 2022. The respect that he has built among his peers throughout the league was reflected in 2024, when the six-time Pro Bowler was voted on to the NFLPA Executive Committee. A force on the field, Heyward is also known for the work he does in his team city and hometown of Pittsburgh. In 2015, the three-time NFLPA Community MVP started the Heyward House Foundation with a mission of creating initiatives that positively impact kids in need. Ted Karras | Vice President The two-time Super Bowl champion was drafted out of Illinois in the sixth round of the 2016 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots. Karras quickly established himself as a starter, playing multiple positions on the offensive line while helping to propel the Patriots to two Super Bowl wins in his first three seasons. After spending the next three seasons with the Patriots and Miami Dolphins, he signed with Cincinnati, where he's served as starting center, a captain and a player rep. The third-generation NFL player was elected to the NFLPA Executive Committee at the 2025 Board of Player Reps meeting. Case Keenum | Vice President After setting several NCAA records while at the University of Houston, Keenum signed with the Houston Texans as an undrafted free agent in 2012. Since then, the veteran quarterback has been a voice within numerous locker rooms during his 12-year career, including the Los Angeles Rams, Minnesota (where he threw the pass behind the Minneapolis Miracle), Denver, Washington, Cleveland, Buffalo and now Houston, again. In 2023, Keenum was voted as the Texans' second alternate rep, paving the way for his election to the NFLPA Executive Committee at the 2024 Board of Player Reps meeting. Ryan Kelly | Vice President Selected during the first round of the 2016 NFL draft by the Indianapolis Colts, the former Alabama Center made an immediate impact and has been named to three Pro Bowls. Kelly has served as the Colts’ player representative since 2020. He was voted onto the NFLPA Executive Committee at the annual Board of Player Representatives meeting in 2022 and re-elected in 2024. Brandon McManus | Vice President After signing with Indianapolis as an undrafted free agent out of Temple, McManus has been a kicker for the Denver Broncos and Jacksonville Jaguars since 2014. His play helped the Broncos win Super Bowl 50. In 2017, McManus became the player representative for the Broncos and has been a dependable player leader for his locker room. In 2022, McManus was elected to the Executive Committee and re-elected in 2024. The veteran kicker has made his mark in the Denver community through the Project McManus foundation, which he launched in 2019. He has twice been named a NFLPA Community MVP in 2020 and 2021 for helping restaurants and single-parent households during the pandemic and hosting a holiday giving initiative, respectively Thomas Morstead | Vice President The punter and kickoff specialist from SMU was selected in 2009 NFL draft by the New Orleans Saints and went on to win a Super Bowl in his first pro season. Morstead was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2012 and previously served as the team’s elected player union representative. In 2018, he was voted onto the NFLPA Executive Committee and re-elected in 2020, 2022 and 2024 to once again serve as a steadfast leader for the full player membership. Off the field, Morstead formed his charity – What You Give Will Grow, a Thomas Morstead Foundation – to improve the lives of those in need through the support of local causes and organizations, focusing primarily on pediatric cancer. After the 2018 NFC Divisional game versus the Minnesota Vikings, when Morstead returned to the field in the final seconds following what appeared to be a walk-off Saints loss, Vikings fans donated more the $140,000 to his foundation. Morstead, in turn, decided to donate all the contributions to the Children's Hospital in Minnesota.] Board of Player Representatives Player Representatives are selected by their teammates in the fall of every even-numbered year.
