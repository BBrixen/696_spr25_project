But 2021, despite being lauded as an incredible class, hasn’t quite lived up to lofty expectations. Mobley has settled into a 16/10 guy with good defense, the 3rd best player on his team Cade, while good this year and averaging 22/4/8 is playing on a team that could finish with 66 losses Jalen Green is playing closer to how you’d hope a 2nd overall pick plays, averaging 20/5/4, but has been inconsistent and is not the best player on the rockets Scottie Barnes has blossomed with no Siakam and OG, averaging 20/8/6, but the raptors are on pace for 56 losses, unknown if he can be the best player on a good team Wagner, Suggs, Kuminga, Giddey: all show flashes, with Wagner being the 2nd best player on the magic, but none look like they have best player on a team potential. The exception is potentially Sengun, who was drafted 16th and has averaged 21/9/5 this season, though obviously it’s unclear how good the rockets can be with him, and they’re currently 11th in the west, with little hope remaining for the play in.
