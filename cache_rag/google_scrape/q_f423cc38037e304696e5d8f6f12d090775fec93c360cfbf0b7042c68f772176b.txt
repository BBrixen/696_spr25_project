By Anne Cohen Sept. 24, 2022 A new season of The Crown is on the way. The show announced its Nov. 9 return during Netflix’s annual Tudum fan event . The fifth season, which stars Elizabeth Debicki and Dominic West as Diana and Charles, explores the breakdown of the marriage between the Prince and the Princess of Wales. Fronting the new cast are Imelda Staunton and Jonathan Pryce, who will take over the roles of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip from Olivia Colman and Tobias Menzies. Lesley Manville also joins as Princess Margaret, with Claudia Harrison taking on the role of Princess Anne, and Jonny Lee Miller playing Prime Minister John Major. Season 4 of The Crown follows the royal family throughout the turbulent 1980s, ending with a fraught Christmas reunion in 1990. The finale leaves Diana and Charles — who began the season as newlyweds —  increasingly at odds and searching for meaning as a new decade dawns. With five distinct celebrations, Tudum: A Netflix Global Fan Event includes first-look photos, never-before-seen footage, new trailers, behind-the-scenes access, celebrity appearances, interviews and more from over 100 of your favorite series, films and specials.
