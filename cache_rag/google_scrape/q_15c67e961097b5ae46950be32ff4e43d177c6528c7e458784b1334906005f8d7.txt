Why were they both nominated for supporting, and was there a lead in the film? If it’s one of the things were they both were co-leads, then wouldn’t they have been nominated for lead actors? I’m still confused. X Reply laslo Joined: Oct 19th, 2021 Topics: 3 Posts: 2123 View Predictions October 7, 2023 at 8:44 am #1205574347 They were both leads. But the chance of any studio campaigning for two lead actors these days is almost zero. Studios don’t do that anymore. Example is DiCaprio and Pitt, Blanchett and Mara, someone is going to be frauded. And it’s easier to win in Supporting with a lead performance, as it gives you much more screen time and character development than your competitors. That was the strategy, frauding Kaluuya into Supporting to ensure he won the Oscar. Stanfield’s case is rare, but the most obvious thing we can assume is that the confusion happened because the campaign for him was almost non-existent, all the film’s campaigns and promotional material aimed at the Oscars revolved around Kaluuya, leaving no doubt that he was aiming for a nomination in Supporting. Stanfield is an actor who had been hanging around the Hollywood bubble for some time so it’s quite reasonable that they wanted to give him some recognition, as another lead performance in the same film was going to win Supporting, the majority of voters must have opted to put him in the same category on their ballots. A coattail nomination similar to Jesse Plemons’ nomination (of course Plemons wasn’t category fraud). That was a very atypical year all around, most voters had other things to worry about, so that must have contributed for the confusion in placement.

The majority likely considered them the other way round as per the campaign ads (without necessarily voting for Stanfield in lead), but the confusion was enough to land Stanfield a nod in supporting alongside his co-star, especially as Stanfield would’ve had relatively few votes in the lead category. I doubt there were many from the actors branch who individually voted for both actors in supporting.

I doubt there were many from the actors branch who individually voted for both actors in supporting. We will never know what actually happened but I doubt that voters would decide to vote for Kaluuya in lead at random when he had won as Supporting in all the precursors. I believe that the overwhelming majority already knew that he would not only be nominated but would win in Supporting. Slotting both in Supporting becomes even more logical with the category being so weak and without consensus. Who would be the fifth nominee, Jared Leto for The Little Things, Alan Kim for Minari, someone from Da 5 Bloods (Chadwick Boseman presumed to be winning in Lead at that point) with the film only nominated for Original Score?

Probably one of the single strangest nominations to EVER happen. LaKeith is great and I’m happy for a nod although you know he would’ve been nominated eventually for a REALLY deserving role (I thought his character was underwritten). My one disappointment is that with both guys cracking the supporting 5, the wonderful Dominique Fishback couldn’t sneak into Supporting Actress 💔! (My fav performance in that film and she was great in both Judas & Project Power in 2020, quite a coming out for her!)
