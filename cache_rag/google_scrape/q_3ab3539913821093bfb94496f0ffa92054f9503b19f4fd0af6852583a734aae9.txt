The number of active players on launch day for Assassin's Creed Valhalla doubled that of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, a trend that is expected to continue as sales of the new generation of consoles increase. A testament to Assassin's Creed Valhalla delivering on players' expectations for its fascinating world and immersive narrative, the game has reached high levels of viewership and engagement on Twitch and YouTube that surpass any Ubisoft game launch to date. "We are humbled by the reception from the players and extremely proud of what our teams have accomplished with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which builds on the amazing success of its predecessors," said Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft co-founder and CEO. "In the context of COVID-19, shipping Assassin's Creed Valhalla on no less than seven platforms is an incredible achievement for all of the teams involved around the world. We are excited to greet players on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 with a game that unleashes the power of the new hardware. This paves the way for an exciting holiday, with Assassin's Creed Valhalla set to be one of this season's biggest hits." Click to expand...

I'm glad it did well though. I've always had a place in my heart for AC.

Watchdogs and Valhalla for £12 is a great deal. I usually sub to this and EA whenever a new game comes out as I don't tend to replay games. imapioneer Member Oct 27, 2017 1,057 Nov 12, 2020 #15 AndrewDean84 said: It's on an additional console as well.

God, black flag was absolutely an amazing crossgen title. Fantastic characters and story. I love kenway and that game had one of the greatest and heartfelt endings to an assassins creed game period.

Then Cyberpunk got delayed and people needed something to play.  This worked out for Ubisoft about as well as could reasonably be expected.  Watch Dogs bombed but that's their fault. Fredrik Member Oct 27, 2017 9,003 Nov 12, 2020 #20 Awesome! Started playing it on Series X yesterday, I'm very very pleased by my first play session, could almost deal with the woman's name for the male protag as well, didn't sounds as wrong in english "Ay-War!", can't wait to jump in again tonight!

Right, but there's a difference between an AC game coming out on an xbox one X, and AC being "THE" game for your brand spanking new series X. It's one of the strongest titles on both systems, which helps both new buyers as well as word of mouth for everyone that isn't getting one. MrBob Member Oct 25, 2017 6,822 Nov 12, 2020 #23 Uplay Plus could be a driver too.  No AC game launched day one on the service before.  Though I expect this game to sell well. cw_sasuke Member Oct 27, 2017 29,901 Nov 12, 2020 #24 Linus815 said: remember the time people were concerned for Valhallas sales because of cyberpunk Click to expand...

Both Origins and Odyssey sold over 10 mil, with Odyssesy outperforming Origins, so it could be in the realm of 20 mil sold. The downplay about this series' popularity continues to amuse me. It's performing well due to many factors, but the main one being is simply because it's Assassin's Creed.

But now invest that shit into some games that don't center around white people. Giolon One Winged Slayer Member Oct 25, 2017 3,538 Nov 12, 2020 #29 It's interesting to see the trajectory. Unity launches somewhat as a fiasco, players take it out on Syndicate by ignoring it, even though it's fine. After taking a year off, Origins has to build up a reputation back up for the franchise. Makes a solid splash as a Witcher clone. Odyssey comes out a year later building on the success of Origins and makes enough improvements to reach its own high status. Banking on the rep of Odyssey and Origin, players buy Valhalla in droves. Valhalla's way more buggy and broken than the other two were at launch (Not to say they were bug free). What will happen next?! Straw narrative for sure, but that's how it seems to me. TheYanger Avenger Oct 25, 2017 10,391 Nov 12, 2020 #30 Giolon said: It's interesting to see the trajectory.

Valhalla doesn't seem particularly broken? some expected open world bugginess but I wouldn't say it has seemed any worse than the previous two anecdotally on the internet. I feel like Unity has irreparably harmed the perception of these games when it comes to stability.

Many players can't even make progress in the main story. To me it's not worth playing in its current state. Kaswa101 Member Oct 28, 2017 18,387 Nov 12, 2020 #32 Nice.

I played both Origins and Odyssey at launch, platinumed them both. Unfortunately, 2 hours into Valhalla on PS4 Pro it's buggy enough that I am putting it down until it's patched, to a degree neither of the other games were. I loved what I played, but it was nearly unplayable at times. Of course that's a single data point and not everyone experiences the same bugs or are bothered by the same things. I do wonder how much it has to do with the final 8 months of development being impacted by COVID? Here's a short recording of some of what I experienced: Great to see player numbers are strong. I look forward to what this series can accomplish when it has a chance to focus on the new platforms.

The screen tearing is awful too a lot of the time, its like being in the early 2000's again klier Banned Oct 29, 2017 937 Nov 12, 2020 #36 Because it's a next gen launch game. I would not have bought it if the Xbox had some more interesting games at launch. The Praiseworthy Member Oct 30, 2017 10,369 Nov 12, 2020 #37 So happy to see one of the best franchise IMO doing so well, they have been killing it since Origins through Odyssey and now Valhala. Well done Ubi amazing job truly. christocolus Member Oct 27, 2017 14,970 Nov 12, 2020 #38 Nice... XsX and XsS launch must have helped too.

No suprise. Yakuza deserves more love. Joffy Member Oct 30, 2017 1,213 Nov 12, 2020 #41 For me (and with the caveat I'm only 8 hours in) this is the one which finally rubs shoulders with Witcher 3. It's been a fantastic time so far and pretty refreshing compared to relatively small jump between Origins/Odyssey (both of which were still pretty decent) P40L0 Member Jun 12, 2018 9,445 Italy Nov 12, 2020 #42 I hope they quickly fix its HDR implementation (it needs unlocked Brightness/Contrast controls also in HDR and a Paper White slider as Origins/Odyssey had) and tearing issues on Series X then. dex3108 Member Oct 26, 2017 24,526 Nov 12, 2020 #43 Note that they said players not sales. Combined with their expectations that sales will grow with next-gen my guess that it didn't do better than Odyssey in sales. At least on platforms where Ubisoft+ or whatever is called now is available. emmastone Alt-Account Banned Mar 28, 2020 204 Nov 12, 2020 #44 Not that hard, Ubisoft. Consoles have upgrades to next-gen so people buy it, plus it was given away with AMD hardware on PC. Rodrigues solitaire Member Oct 28, 2019 6,331 Nov 12, 2020 #45 Excellent news and well deserved. The best Assassin's Creed of this generation. Plax Member Nov 23, 2019 3,094 Nov 12, 2020 #46 I'm on a couple of hours into it, but it's feeling really good so far. It will be interesting to see if the monotony of previous AC games kicks in. sredgrin Attempted to circumvent ban with alt account Banned Oct 27, 2017 12,276 Nov 12, 2020 #47 emmastone said: Not that hard, Ubisoft.

Got to make a point of why a game that allegedly had no hype and is mostly shit according to pre release ERA is doing well like it's predecessors. degauss Banned Oct 28, 2017 4,631 Nov 12, 2020 #49 I never even heard of Odyssey until  long after launch. Odyssey got lost in the shadow of Origins. They pump out far too many of these assassins creed games. I guess Valhalla is different enough looking/feeling that it stands out, and it's riding the next-gen hype, which helps. But I fully expect another Assassins Creed game with a year or so that gets forgotten too, because for every Rockstar game that comes out these people try to sell you 17 different open world games. Tomasdk Banned Apr 18, 2018 910 Nov 12, 2020 #50 The viking setting is pretty popular nowadays so I guess that was a major contributor. 1 2 Next 1 of 2 Go to page Go Next Last You must log in or register to reply here.
