All players & platforms welcome! Members Online • mws375 What's the time gap between Marvel's Spider Man and Marvel's Spider Man: Miles Morales? Discussion false I've recently played MSM and Miles Morales and one thing doesn't seem to add up. The setting in the first game is: Spider Man is 23 yo Peter Parker, who turned into a super hero at the age of 15. I can't really tell when in the year the story is set, but to me it seems like an early Autumn. At the end of the game, there are 2 things important to this matter that are established: Miles Morales, a 15 yo boy was also bitten by a radioactive spider and developed powers, he will be trained by Peter. Mary Jane Watson got a gig with the Daily Bugle, in which she'll soon travel to Symkaria to report on the civil war that's happening there, Peter will accompany her. Miles Morales' game shows that Miles has been training with Peter, they fight rhino and then Peter leaves to go to Symkaria with MJ, as he'll be working as a photographer also for the Daily Bugle. It's winter, and we get to see the Morales family and friends enjoying Christmas. Comments and conversations during the game seem to show that Miles is still pretty new to the Spider Man thing. To me, it seems that at least 3 or 4 months went by, but throughout the conversations in the game and checking character profiles, Peter is shown to now be 24 and Miles 17. Is this an inconsistency done by Insomniac or did 2 years went by and I just didn't understand the plot? TL;DR: can't tell if the gap between the 2 games is 4 months or 2 years Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
