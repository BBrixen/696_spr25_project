Email address Subscribe Skip to content On my Om Technology & Change: Field Notes From The Present Future Latest Top Posts Newsletter Daily Blog About Om Contact Om Search April 9, 2012 Here is why Facebook bought Instagram You might have heard by now that [company]Facebook[/company] has acquired Instagram for nearly a billion dollars in cash and stock . Incredible, isn‚Äôt it? I have received text messages of awe and shock from many people in the Valley, for no one saw this coming. A few days ago it was rumored to be valued at $500 million. A few months ago it was $300 million. Its last round ‚Äî just a year ago ‚Äî valued the company at $100 million. The rising valuation of the company was reflective of the growing audience it has been garnering, despite being just on the iPhone. It had reached nearly 30 million registered users before it launched an Android app, a turbo-charging event for the company. So the question is: ¬†Why did Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook‚Äôs level-headed but mercenary founder, buy Instagram at twice the valuation that professional venture investors were putting on it? The answer is found in Zuckerberg‚Äôs own blog post: This is an important milestone for Facebook because it‚Äôs the first time we‚Äôve ever acquired a product and company with so many users. We don‚Äôt plan on doing many more of these, if any at all. But providing the best photo sharing experience is one reason why so many people love Facebook and we knew it would be worth bringing these two companies together. My translation : Facebook was scared shitless and knew that for first time in its life it arguably had a competitor that could not only eat its lunch, but also destroy its future prospects. Why? Because Facebook is essentially about photos, and Instagram had found and attacked Facebook‚Äôs achilles heel ‚Äî mobile photo sharing. Here is what I wrote when Instagram launched the Android app . It is pretty clear that thanks to the turbocharge effect of Android, Instagram‚Äôs user base is going to blast past the 50 million mark in a couple of weeks. Just before the company launched its app in October, I had pointed out that there was going to be a mobile-only, photo-oriented social platform that will challenge the established social giants. It will be a summer to remember for this tiny company. Here is another little bit from one of my Om Says newletters : The company had announced an API in February, and since then a raft of new apps have come up to capitalize on it .¬†While filters might have jumpstarted Instagram, the company, which already has over 4 million subscribers, has to focus on its core value proposition ‚Äì¬†community and the social interactions around unique visual experiences. I hope Instagram allows more apps to export directly to its network. By opening itself up to other apps and services, it has the potential to slowly become the hub of our mobile photo experiences. And in the end, that‚Äôs what would make Instagram so much more valuable and in the¬†process¬†become the Flickr of mobile photos. In other words, if there was any competitor that could give Zuckerberg heartburn, it was Systrom‚Äôs posse. They are growing like mad on mobile, and Facebook‚Äôs mobile platform (including its app) is mediocre at best. Why? Facebook is not a mobile-first company and they don‚Äôt think from the mobile-first perspective. Facebook‚Äôs internal ideology is that of a desktop-centric Internet company. Instagram is the exact opposite.¬†It has created a platform built on emotion . It created not a social network, but instead built a beautiful social platform of shared experiences . Facebook and Instagram are two distinct companies with two distinct personalities. Instagram has what Facebook craves ‚Äì passionate community.¬†People like Facebook. People use Facebook. People love Instagram. It is my single most-used app. I spend an hour a day on Instagram. I have made friends based on photos they share. I know how they feel, and how they see the world. Facebook lacks soul. Instagram is all soul and emotion. It is one of the reasons I connected with the app even before it launched. It went deeper than just a photo app. Over the years,¬†Kevin shared his grand ambition about Instagram and building a much larger platform, so from that perspective I guess I am a little surprised ‚Äì though I thought Kevin and his team would go a lot further, for as Erica pointed out last week, the best is yet to come for mobile photos . More importantly, it cracked the code where Facebook itself failed: viral growth on mobile. From that perspective I wonder if Kevin sold too soon, though I know it is easy for me to say.¬†But then¬†the road from product and a platform to a business is long, twisted and full of potholes. Perhaps that explains why the Instagram team decided to cash in their chips. 189 comments Subscribe to discover Om‚Äôs fresh perspectives on the present and future.

Instagram is massively overvalued and they have done remarkably to achieve this price. They have 8 employees For Gods sake. Reply James S says: April 14, 2012 at 10:06 am Clearly you didn‚Äôt read the article posted up top of the page there.. If Instagram really did pose a serious threat, and really planned to become flickr in the mobile space, a cool billion was quite likely on the low side of things and too soon. Then again, I‚Äôm still pretty sure this is a simple user/data buy up, in any case, who the hell are you to act like you know what Facebook was really willing to pay or how big Instagram could have been. PS, 8 employees for an app that takes pictures? Overkill.

Reply nikolaus heger says: April 9, 2012 at 5:50 pm Totally ‚Äì Zuckerberg is just thinking about the question ‚Äúwhat could replace Facebook‚Äù and instagram is on top of the list. Money is no issue given Facebook‚Äôs own (ridiculous IMO) valuation. I think FB is way overvalued but Zuckerberg is making the best of it with moves like this. This is no time to skimp. Reply Ivan Dwyer says: April 12, 2012 at 3:18 pm Sure, but let‚Äôs define competition in this instance. Would Instagram ever compete at a platform level? I highly doubt they would have ever grown to that capacity. Would they ever compete at a user level? Facebook laughs at 30-50 million users and I‚Äôm sure 99.99999% of Instagram users are Facebook users anyway. Where Instagram does compete is in time spent using the service, which is directly translated to lost advertising revenue for Facebook. With the IPO coming up, preserving revenue streams is of the upmost importance, which may account for the rash ‚Äúmake vs buy‚Äù decision. It will be interesting to see what they actually do with the service as it‚Äôs not in their best interest to let it remain as-is other than to save face‚Ä¶ which they hardly care about :/ Reply IndianF1Fan says: April 9, 2012 at 12:13 pm OMG that was a nice read Om sir! really loved the way you put the facts on the table!

Seems like a symptom of the current bubble. Reply Leather & Porridge says: April 9, 2012 at 12:14 pm Great article! You bring out a lot of key points. Facebook had to go after Instagram. They pretty much had no choice. I love instagram, and what I loved most about it (oh no I‚Äôm already using love as a past tense) was it‚Äôs exclusivity. FB is a platform for a heaping amount of craziness ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really hoping  Instagram doesn‚Äôt fall prey to that. Reply Om Malik says: April 9, 2012 at 1:46 pm Leather & Porridge? that is an interesting name‚Ä¶. Reply Leather & Porridge says: April 10, 2012 at 10:39 am Thanks, it‚Äôs the name of my blog. Reply Kevin Selhi says: April 9, 2012 at 12:16 pm I think of this like the moment when Google acquired YouTube. FB is getting content, users, technology, and talent. The price is about right. I think Google probably got more value in paying $1.65b for YouTube, but times and prices have changed. Instagram is definitely one of the best mobile apps in the world right now, and will probably prove worth the price. Reply chocolatecoco says: April 9, 2012 at 12:19 pm No one saw this coming?

Reply Qasim Virjee says: April 9, 2012 at 12:29 pm It will be fascinating to see what happens over the coming months; ‚Äì Will Facebook will try to integrate Instagram‚Äôs userbase and functionality into its own platform or keep it as an independent property and try to bring non-Facebook users over to Facebook through basic things like unified login? ‚Äì Will Facebook kill the independent brand identity of Instagram, likely loosing users in the process? ‚Äì What will be the user fallout resulting from Instagram users not wanting their photos to be owned by Facebook (or general discontent with Facebook itself) and how will this affect other social photo apps‚Äô user-base growth? With a price of nearly $1billion it almost feels like the momentum Instagram has for capturing new users has been priced by Facebook as far more valuable than the marketshare it expects competitor apps/services to own and conceivably gain in the next little while. q./ Reply Lisa says: April 9, 2012 at 12:36 pm Facebook has crappy photo upload and share from mobile (and the FB apps don‚Äôt help).  Instagram cracked mobile. Reply Robert Scoble says: April 9, 2012 at 12:41 pm I disagree. http://www.quora.com/Instagram/What-about-Instagram-made-it-worth-a-1B-acquisition-by-Facebook is my answer. Printed here too: Facebook has a problem. After its IPO completes it needs many quarters of strong revenue and profit growth to report to convince investors to stay put and convince new ones to buy the stock. Zuckerberg is aiming at turning the $80 to $100 billion valuation that will happen at IPO into a $500 billion to $1 trillion company. How will he do that? Look at mobile. That‚Äôs what. Today Facebook has NO revenues from mobile. None. That‚Äôs amazing, since so many people, hundreds of millions of us, use Facebook on mobile clients. That will change very quickly after the IPO. Instagram will play a huge role here, plus Facebook gets a very talented mobile development team that has built world-leading mobile apps on iOS and Android (which got a million users in its first day). Let‚Äôs say that Facebook can turn on monetization on mobile clients. That could mean $500 million in revenue on first quarter, $700 on second, $900-$1 billion on third. Looking at it this way paying a billion for Instagram makes a LOT of sense. Especially when you consider that the mobile team Facebook just acquired is going to be able to build a range of apps. But that‚Äôs just the beginning. Remember, Facebook is a new media company: one where the media comes to you based on what it knows about you. Instagram adds some important new pieces of data to the Facebook databases: 1. It knows who you like seeing photos from. That gets Facebook a dramatically better photo ‚Äúgraph.‚Äù That keeps it ahead of Google+, which wooed photographers strongly in its first seven months on the market. 2. It knows where you are when you shoot the photo. That is very important info for Facebook to know about you. 3. It shows a range of passions that you have. If you are a skiier, you take pictures of snow and skiing. If you are a foodie you take pictures of food at high-end restaurants. If you are into quilting, a lot of your photos will be of that. If you are into mountain biking, the same. Facebook‚Äôs databases need this info to optimize the media it will bring to you. This data is WORTH SHITLOADS! Imagine you‚Äôre a ski resort and want to react skiiers, Instagram will give them a new way to do that, all while being far more targeted than Facebook otherwise could be. 4. Instagram will let Facebook develop a new kind of Open Graph advertising. One where Facebook will be able to offer mobile developers a lot of money in return for opening their apps up to Open Graph. Venture Capitalists in Silicon Valley are slobbering over this new potential revenue stream, so having lots of VC buyin (they just got a nice payday) will be very important. Imagine that Benchmark now ‚Äúasks‚Äù all of its member companies to support such a new advertising scheme? This could result in billions of revenues for Facebook and member companies. And, there are probably a few more things elsewhere that this acquisition will do for Facebook. Reply Marketman says: April 10, 2012 at 10:00 am I disagree with your disagreement: I don‚Äôt believe this acquisition was fueled by a concern for generating mobile revenue. 1. Instagram has not shown any knack for monetizing their usage 2. If Instagram and Facebook user-bases overlap considerably (I‚Äôm assuming they do), Facebook is not gaining significant incremental data from this newly acquired ‚Äúphoto graph.‚Äù 3. You really don‚Äôt think that with all the cash Facebook has and will have after the IPO they can‚Äôt hire talent to create a photo-sharing mobile experience like what the handful of employees at Instragram created? My assessment of this move was for Facebook to 1) Weed out their biggest threat, 2) To show investors, present and future, that they‚Äôre in-it-to-win-it, and 3) Show the world that they‚Äôre still ‚Äúhip‚Äù Reply Marcy Sutton says: April 9, 2012 at 12:50 pm ‚ÄúSold too soon‚Äù? 1B seems hard to top‚Ä¶.

Reply jookyone says: April 10, 2012 at 1:08 pm Probably because they have their own mobile ecosystem, their own mobile OS, and a thousand mobile app developers already‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs just a guess.

Reply Tom Foremski says: April 9, 2012 at 1:49 pm As it moves towards its IPO Facebook has to show it continues to have momentum on the user numbers and engagement. $1bn is not much insurance to pay to muddy the waters and to hide any possibly damaging churn in its numbers.

Reply aepxc says: April 9, 2012 at 1:56 pm The biggest reason for which I loved Instagram was that it was light, simple, and with a single purpose. Now it isn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs no shortage of ways to take filter/effect photos and upload them to Facebook. Now Instagram is just one more of them. I am uninstalling the app and will wait and see what Facebook does with it before deciding whether to return or not. I strongly suspect that I will not be the only one. To me, this actually reveals a bit of a strategic blindness at Facebook ‚Äì one of the features that can drive competing social networks (especially narrowly-focused ‚Äòsocial networks‚Äô ‚Äì social platforms?) to great success is their lack of forced integration with Facebook. It‚Äôs the ability to have more than clearly distinct facet to one‚Äôs digital identity. The blindness mostly applies, of course, if Facebook‚Äôs goal is to acquire Instagram with the hopes of retaining and growing Instagram‚Äôs current positioning. If it just wanted to kill a powerful competitor, it probably just did so pretty well. Reply Jason O'Keefe says: April 9, 2012 at 2:03 pm I have to agree with that idea, the ‚Äúnon-forced‚Äù integration to Facebook as a selling point. Not everyone wants everything on Facebook ‚Äì at all. And, I‚Äôm sure Instagram won‚Äôt become the ghost town that Google + is, why? Because my mom is on Facebook, my mom is not on Instagram, which tells me while Instagram has a big community, it‚Äôs not the winner just yet. Reply Greg McLaughlin says: April 9, 2012 at 2:03 pm One thing I kept wondering about was how IG would start making money after the funding money ran out.  I think that the staggering growth seen up until and continuing past the Android launch only would only see them burning through money even faster.  I can‚Äôt fault IG for wanting going through a door that would repay the investment and make them some money at the same time.  I agree, though that anyone who sees IG as just a hipster filter photo app really didn‚Äôt see the incredible social network that emerged.  It is still my favorite community to belong to because these pictures offer a glimpse into someone‚Äôs life that a simple status update cannot possibly give you. But I do feel like I was bought and sold, not unlike some customer list.  I guess it had to happen at some point and it either was going to be Facebook or Google with IG‚Äôs value going up and up.

I agree, but $1B (even if half is stock) is pretty tempting. The bottom line is that Instagram could have challenged Facebook directly in its space for all the reasons mentioned above, but with deeper pockets due to their IPO, Facebook would likely have figured out how to crush it some way or another. It was smart to cash in and move on. At least this way, some of the elegant Instagram technology will live on inside Facebook. I doubt the ‚Äúsoul and emotion‚Äù feature will survive the advertising juggernaut that Facebook corporate has become, however.

I really dislike the prominence of the FB/Google/Amazon business model that is undortunately becoming a norm in the tech/web realm.

No amount of logic can persuade you that a photo sharing app, of which there are dozens, that has no revenue and no logical future revenue stream is worth $1 billion.

I hope Facebook doesn‚Äôt force changes on ig users it doesn‚Äôt want. I‚Äôm a former user of Facebook. It just wasn‚Äôt my ‚Äúshtick‚Äù. Something for everyone is a great idea, to me, as I dare you to find two people on this earth who think and feel alike regarding all topics. Have a fantastic day!

You missed the biggest reason of all! Reply Bartosz Solowiej says: May 3, 2012 at 10:43 am I remember sitting with you in early 2010, Om, and you asking me where Instagram was going‚Ä¶  seems it was going well‚Ä¶   so this begs the question, why spoil it on Facebook? Reply getdowngetdirty says: May 15, 2012 at 7:56 pm The real reason Instagram is so valuable, according to me, is because of tags. Right now, Facebook photos have no segmentation. The fact that Instagram users tag so heavily allows segmenting of that data, and will eventually allow very targeted advertising. Photos are just one of many important features of Facebook‚Äôs platform ‚Äì not necessarily it‚Äôs Achilles heel. Reply dave says: June 7, 2012 at 3:39 am frankly i dont get it.. instagram is an absolutely grabage platform that really just mocks real photographers.. its stupid. Reply jacob says: June 12, 2012 at 8:39 am The FTC/SEC should absolutely block Facebook from buying one of its strongest competitors ‚Äî Instagram. ¬†Instagram is a photo based social network that now has 50,000,000 users. its one of the strongest competitors facebook has seen to date. Facebook has network effects. Without network effects Mark and Co. would have had strong competition a long time ago. ¬†Instagram is one of the few companies that found a hole in Facebook‚Äôs armour through its early jump on mobile platforms. ¬†It would be a shame to simply watch Facebook buy away the competition. Do the right thing FTC/SEC and block the buyout. ¬†Make Facebook compete. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.
