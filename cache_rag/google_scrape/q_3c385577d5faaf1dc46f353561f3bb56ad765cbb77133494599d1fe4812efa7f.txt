He is the director of football at Willem II . Club career [ edit ] Mathijsen started his football career at SV VOAB in Goirle after he visited a training session of a friend as a young boy. At the age of nine, he left this club and came through the youth system of Willem II . He was promoted to the first team for the 1998–99 season, making his debut on 27 February 1999 in a match against FC Utrecht . After six seasons at Willem II, he was sold by manager Co Adriaanse to AZ . However, he endured a harder time breaking into the first team with AZ and his case was not helped by injuries. [ citation needed ] After finishing as runners-up in the Eredivisie in 2006 , Mathijsen opted to transfer to German Bundesliga side Hamburger SV for €6 million, where he teamed up with fellow Dutchmen Rafael van der Vaart and Nigel de Jong . He scored Hamburg's 2,500th Bundesliga goal (his first for the club) on 20 October 2007 against VfB Stuttgart . [ 2 ] In November 2008, Mathijsen signed a new contract extension, tying him to Hamburg until the summer of 2012. [ 3 ] In mid-June 2011, however, he signed a two-year contract with Spanish La Liga side Málaga . [ citation needed ] In the summer of 2012, it became apparent that Málaga was willing to let Mathijsen transfer to another club, prompting several Dutch sides to show interest, including Feyenoord and Ajax ; on 10 August, Mathijsen signed with the former. [ citation needed ] International career [ edit ] Mathijsen playing for the Netherlands at Euro 2012 On 17 November 2004, Mathijsen made his international debut for the Netherlands against Andorra in a 3–0 away win. [ citation needed ] Since his international debut, Mathijsen became a mainstay figure in the national team, especially after impressing with Hamburger SV. He was usually positioned as left central defender, because of his strong left-foot.  He was called up to the Dutch squad for UEFA Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland. Initially in danger of losing his spot to Wilfred Bouma , he followed it up with a decent enough performance at the Euro 2008 and remained first-choice. [ 4 ] Mathijsen was ever present for Oranje during the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying . [ 5 ] He played more minutes than any other player in the Dutch squad and played a key role in their record of having conceded the fewest goals in their qualifying group. [ citation needed ] Mathijsen was part of the Dutch team for the 2010 World Cup , managed by Bert van Marwijk . [ 6 ] The player was in the starting line-up for their first match in the competition, a 2–0 victory over Denmark , and started in all their matches on the way to the final .
