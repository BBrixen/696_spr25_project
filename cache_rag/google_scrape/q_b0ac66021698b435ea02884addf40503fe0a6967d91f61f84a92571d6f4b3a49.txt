Which Countries Have Hosted The Most Olympics? - WorldAtlas Which Countries Have Hosted The Most Olympics? The modern Olympic Games , having made its debut in 1896 in none other than Athens, Greece , have since been hosted in dozens of countries around the world every four years. This celebration of athletics around the globe has made a point of changing host cities most years. Since 1994, two Olympic games have been held in differing years: the Summer Olympics (often referred to simply as "The Olympic Games") and the Winter Olympics. The games have been going on for well over a century at this point, and over the decades, there are certain countries who have stepped up as hosts more than others. Reasons can vary, and there is a lot that goes into qualifying, from financial feasibility, availability of sporting facilities, ability to provide amenities for both athletes and guests, and political climate. The United States takes the lead, hosting more Olympic Games than any other country. Learn more about which countries have been home to the Olympic Games the most, with a focus on the notable entries that have hosted more than two. 1. United States - 8 View of the Centennial Olympic Park, built for the 1996 Summer Olympics, located in downtown Atlanta, Georgia.

Having numerous cities that fit the bill for either winter or summer events (or both in some instances), a total of eight Olympic Games have taken place in the US. There have been four Summer Games, with a fifth one scheduled for Los Angeles in 2028, and four Winter Games. Summer Olympics St. Louis - 1904 Los Angeles - 1932 Los Angeles - 1984 Atlanta - 1996 Winter Olympics Lake Placid - 1932 Olympic Valley (formerly "Squaw Valley) - 1960 Lake Placid - 1980 Salt Lake City - 2002 2. France - 6 The Olympic symbol installed on the Eiffel Tower for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

From the snowcapped mountains of the Alps to bustling cities like Paris , France has no shortage of places that are perfect to host events in all seasons.

Japan - 4 The five ring symbol of the Olympic Games in front of Odaiba Rainbow Bridge, Tokyo, Japan. Image credit StreetVJ via Shutterstock Despite having two entire games canceled (one for the winter in Sapporo in 1940 and one for the summer in Tokyo, also in 1940) due to Japan initiating the widely decried Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and their involvement in World War II , Japan still sits with an impressive number of four. With two winter games in the country's mountainous regions of Hokkaido and Nagano Basin, and two summer games hosted in the massive city of Tokyo, Japan has more than proven why they continue to be a top pick for the games.

Notably, the 1944 London Olympics were canceled because of World War II and then rescheduled to 1948. Summer Olympics London - 1908 London - 1948 London - 2012 Winter Olympics 0 4. Canada - 3 Olympic rings and podium on Whistler mountain for the Winter Olympics in 2010. With Canada 's abundance of cold, mountainous regions and reputation for having lengthy winters, on top of its financial and political stability, it has been the host of multiple Winter Olympics. Surprisingly, Canada's biggest city (in several categories, by quite a margin too), Toronto , has never hosted, despite being the home of similar large-scale sporting events like the 2015 Pan American Games . Summer Olympics Montreal - 1976 Winter Olympics Calgary - 1988 Vancouver - 2010 4. Italy - 3 Overlooking the snow-covered alpine village of Sestriere, which was the site of the Winter Olympics in 2006. Italy is yet another country that had its games canceled during World War II. It has since made up for the loss with one summer game in its capital of Rome and two winter games in its idyllic northern Alps. Summer Olympics Rome - 1960 Winter Olympics Cortina d'Ampezz - 1956 Turin - 2006 4. Germany - 3 Aerial view of the Olympiapark in the German city of Munich, which hosted the Olympic games in 1972. Germany is not only the fourth country to tie at fourth for the most Olympics hosted, but it also had its games canceled in World World II, that being the Garmisch-Partenkirchen Winter Olympics of 1940. Germany has had a total of one Summer Olympics and two Winter Olympics within its borders since. Summer Olympics Berlin - 1936 Winter Olympics Garmisch-Partenkirchen - 1936 Munich (formerly in West Germany) - 1972 Countries That Have Hosted the Olympics 23 different countries have hosted the Olympic Games since its beginning over 128 years ago.
