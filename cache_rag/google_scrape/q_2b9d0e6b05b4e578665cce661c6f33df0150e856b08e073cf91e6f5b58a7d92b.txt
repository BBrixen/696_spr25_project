The journey hasn't been without its challenges. The firing and swift return of CEO and co-founder Sam Altman raised concerns about OpenAI's direction, creating opportunities for competitors like Meta and its LLaMA family of large language models. Despite the controversy, ChatGPT remains a force to be reckoned with. With 100 million weekly active users since its launch nearly a year ago, OpenAI continues to heavily invest in its development. The company showcased its commitment during the first-ever OpenAI DevDay on November 6 2023, announcing significant updates to GPT, including the introduction of GPT-4 Turbo and a multimodal API. The GPT store, allowing users to create and monetize custom versions of GPT, faced a delay in its December launch but is now set to debut in January. GPT-4, known for its natural and fluent writing and image creation capabilities, is primarily accessible to paying ChatGPT users. However, a free avenue opens up through Microsoft's Bing Chat in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Safari browsers. Beyond these advancements, OpenAI connected ChatGPT to the internet for all users, and the integration of DALL-E 3 enables users to generate both text prompts and images seamlessly within the platform. Here is a summary of ChatGPT's product updates and releases, offering a comprehensive overview of its evolution throughout the year. Integration of ChatGPT in Bing Owing to the growing popularity of ChatGPT, Microsoft announced the integration of ChatGPT 4 into Bing. As a result, Microsoft witnessed substantial growth in the number of daily downloads for Bing. Later, other bigwigs like Discord and Snapchat integrated ChatGPT owing to its popularity. New Plugins and ChatGPT Plus In February 2023, since ChatGPT had a lot of user traffic, its makers launched a paid version called ChatGPT Plus . It was launched to provide uninterrupted and super-fast service to users at all times. GPT 4 was officially launched in March 2023 for premium users of ChatGPT. It still had a limitation of only 100 prompts every four hours; the limit was gradually reduced to 25 prompts due to heavy traffic. In the same month, OpenAI introduced plugins for ChatGPT, expanding the bot's abilities by giving it access to external knowledge sources, databases, and the internet. A ChatGPT iOS and Android App In May, OpenAI released a dedicated iOS app for ChatGPT users where the user history could synchronize across devices, granting accessibility to prior searches made through its web interface. Later in July, a similar app was introduced for Android users . Earlier, it was available in the US and a few limited countries, including Brazil and India. Later, it was released worldwide.

Browse With Bing Feature In June, the ChatGPT app released a new feature by utilizing Bing for web searches . OpenAI revealed that ChatGPT Plus subscribers can access this feature called Browsing, enabling the model to search Bing for answers. To enable Browsing, users can navigate to the New Features section in app settings, choose "GPT 4" in the model switcher, and select "Browse with Bing" from the drop-down menu. This feature was made available for both iOS and Android ChatGPT users. Compatibility With iPad In June, the ChatGPT app became compatible with iPad, introducing native support for Siri and Shortcuts. Users could easily utilize drag and drop functionality to transfer individual messages from ChatGPT to other applications. When running on iPad, users could operate ChatGPT in full-screen mode, a feature tailored for optimal use on the tablet's interface. Custom Instructions Feature In August, OpenAI added a ‘custom instructions’ feature to the free version of ChatGPT. This feature makes it easier for users to specify their particular preferences beforehand when asking ChatGPT to generate future prompts for them. OpenAI also stated about opening accessibility of ChatGPT 4 to all developers and immediate access to those developers who have a track record of successful payments. This could help developers make changes and customize both versions of GPT; 3.5 and ChatGPT 4. ChatGPT Enterprise In August, OpenAI published a special guide for those who were hesitant to use ChatGPT for academic purposes. This guide was created for users who wanted to use ChatGPT without any controversial content appearing in their searches or simply those teachers who fear students plagiarizing existing content through ChatGPT. Subsequently, OpenAI also released ChatGPT Enterprise, which could draft emails, articles, and coding like ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4. However, this version offered “enterprise-level” privacy and options for data analysis and customization. To use ChatGPT Enterprise, you typically need access provided by your organization or through an enterprise subscription. If your organization has obtained a ChatGPT Enterprise subscription, they will provide you with the necessary details and access instructions. Here are the required steps: 1. Subscription Information Obtain the subscription details, including any access codes or credentials provided by your organization. 2. Access Portal Your organization may have a dedicated portal or platform for accessing ChatGPT Enterprise. Navigate to this portal using a web browser. 3. Login Log in to the portal using the provided credentials. This is usually the username and password associated with your enterprise account. 4. Follow Instructions Once logged in, follow any instructions provided by your organization to access and use ChatGPT Enterprise. This might include API keys, usage guidelines, or specific integration details. 5. Integrate with Your Systems If your organization requires integration with specific applications or systems, follow the provided guidelines for incorporating ChatGPT Enterprise into your workflow. Internet Browsing In September, ChatGPT regained its internet browsing capability. OpenAI announced on X that the chatbot is no longer confined to data before September 2021. While the web browsing feature was initially available for Plus subscribers in July, it was temporarily removed due to users exploiting it to bypass paywalls. Speech-To-Text Features In September, OpenAI also launched more advanced search speech-to-text features for users with ChatGPT Plus. DALL-E 3 and DALL-E were integrated into ChatGPT, where users could upload images, and instead of typing, they could have direct conversations with the bots when giving prompts. Voice Feature in ChatGPT App In November, OpenAI made ChatGPT Voice free for all users. OpenAI reportedly collaborated with professional voiceover actors to create five different voice options for this service. Users can select their desired voice by simply going into the settings option in their ChatGPT app and tapping on the “headphones” icon. Launch of GPT 4 Turbo, DALL-E 3 and New Text-To-Speech Model At the OpenAI DevDay conference, GPT 4 Turbo was introduced in two versions: one focused on text analysis and another capable of understanding both text and images in context. During the OpenAI DevDay event, OpenAI also presented the Assistants API, aimed at aiding developers in crafting "agent-like experiences" within their applications. Possible applications range from a natural language-based data analysis app to a coding assistant and so on. By the end of 2023, OpenAI introduced the DALL-E 3 and unveiled new text-to-speech models. DALL-E 3, the text-to-image model from OpenAI, was released through an API after being initially integrated with ChatGPT-4 and Bing Chat. The Audio API, OpenAI's freshly launched text-to-speech API, presented a selection of six preset voices and two generative AI model variants. Creating Custom GPTs In December 2023, OpenAI again opened the subscription of its ChatGPT Plus service. It temporarily stopped giving access to its ChatGPT Plus service due to high usage of it. The ChatGPT Plus service offers users access to both GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo. OpenAI also introduced the concept of its GPT Store where users can build and earn from their own custom GPTs . The best part of this plan is that users don't have to be professional developers or learn coding to create their own GPT. Those who wish to earn from their own built GPT could monetize by registering it in OpenAI’s marketplace. Conclusion In 2023, ChatGPT evolved significantly with GPT-4 Turbo, multimodal API, and the GPT Store. Despite controversies, premium versions like ChatGPT Plus gained traction. Collaborations with Microsoft and app integrations expanded its reach. Features like personalized instructions and the enterprise version enhanced user experience.
