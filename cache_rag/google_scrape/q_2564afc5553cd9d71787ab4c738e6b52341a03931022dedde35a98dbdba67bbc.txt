The album debuted at number 121 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 16,000 copies in its first week. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The album received mixed reviews. Downey stated in 2006 that he probably will not do another album, as he felt that the energy he put into doing the album was not compensated. He explained that he did not want to spend whatever time he had at home in the studio, but rather with his family. "Broken" plays during the end credits to Downey's 2005 film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang . Recording and composition [ edit ] The Futurist consists of eight pop ballads written by Downey, as well as two cover songs: " Smile ", a Charlie Chaplin composition; and "Your Move", the first half of the song " I've Seen All Good People " by Yes . [ 3 ] The song "Hannah" is an allusion to Downey's 2000 film Wonder Boys . [ 4 ] The album was produced by Jonathan Elias and Mark Hudson , with Downey playing on the piano on some of the tracks. Critical reception [ edit ] Professional ratings Review scores Source Rating AllMusic [ 5 ] USA Today [ 6 ] AllMusic 's Matt Collar rated the album 3.5/5, and called Downey's lyrics "obtuse". However, he praised his interpretations of other musicians' work, such as "Your Move" by Yes and Charlie Chaplin's "Smile", and called the album "unpredictably moving as the best of Downey's film work." [ 5 ] Elysa Gardner of USA Today wrote that the vibe on Downey's album "can seem pretentious or simply dull after a while, but there is a moody musicality to tracks such as 'Man Like Me' and 'Details'."
