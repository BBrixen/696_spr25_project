This is a continuous problem for Monolith. It's a mixture of low quality motion blur, low LOD, HEAVY emphasis on AA (seriously, Monolith Soft always fight their hardest for alias-less imagery especially compared to other Nintendo games) and just low resolution. Even at the game's sharpest in cutscenes, it doesn't look any sharper than XBC2. Also imo they need to update their lighting engine as it's starting to become dated with how flat and baked in it is. They need to take a page from Zelda's lighting engine. The screenshot is technically 1080p but when looking at the sharpness I highly doubt it's much over 720p Click to expand... Click to shrink... I get the feeling they haven't been given a green light to push things on the technical side since X -- and that was in some sense a test case for open world tech (which was likely motivated by Zelda reasons). I do agree their engine looks long in the tooth, but I think we'll have to wait until XBX2 or XBC3, or whatever comes next in the series, to really see them jump forward.

There's nothing to disagree on, the premice of battles is what it is. The feeling is something else. I can add to my post that after the premice uou can feel that, or if you stay static and have lots of blade switch available it can feel faster. But during at least the first few chapters it's without doubt very slow. Whatever your feeling when you play is. Anything else is just plain lie, or there's just nothing objective, all is subjective and we can say whatever we want with mo explanation ever making any sense. 1 and 2 might be close, in different ways maybe but X is easily the one with fastest pace, there is no denying this. kodax_shc Member Oct 27, 2017 7,334 Southern California Mar 28, 2020 #1,309 Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition (Collector's Set) Includes a 250 page artbook full of beautiful landscapes, a SteelBook, a vinyl featuring the Monado printed on the sleeve and a poster! www.game.co.uk It's up on GAME UK.

XBC2 image quality in hand held mode is beyond terrible. It's unacceptable a game should not be released in this condition. Prioritising the effects make no sense when you can't make them out in their fullest intent. Łazy Member Nov 1, 2017 5,249 Mar 28, 2020 #1,317 The talk about resolution, power and so on makes no sense when Xenoblade X exists and Xenoblade 2 has trouble with development. If they continue to do games with poor handheld performance despite the new staff and so on, then yeah, it means the quality of their dev dropped. For now it's only one exception  not the rule. Tyaren said: Yeah, Shulks new outfit is so cool, but I have the feeling that it is especially made for and exclusive to the epilogue. It seems to stand comletely alone as it playable without completing the main story straight from the main menu. That very likely means that all main game team members (replaced in the epilogue by Melia and two nopons), all armor, weapons and all equipment in general will not carry over. Shulks and Melia's new outfits and weapons seem to be the default equipment you will instead be starting the epilogue with. Click to expand... Click to shrink... This is 99.9% sure I think.

These remaster/remakes of Wii and 3ds games gives me more hope that we'll get the treatment with the 3ds Zelda oot and 3ds games.

I don't think this is a switch problem, not when Zelda exists. I don't think their technical chops have made the jump from Wii U to Switch. The move to a physically based renderer has really taken a toll on them. Even Torna had a lot of issues despite there being some improvement.  I hope DE is just a case of early dev footage Onix555 Member Apr 23, 2019 3,386 UK Mar 28, 2020 #1,329 People in here are going full armchair dev.

Yes, XB2 has optimisation issues but overall I feel they were really pushing the graphics, perhaps too far for their initial Switch game. Still, im glad theyre pushing the bounderies (while also improving along the way), some devs who I wont name have become content with being lax on the graphics side of things. Im sure by the end of the Switchs lifespan their games will both look and run absolutely amazingly, and then they can move onto Switch 2 👀 ILikeFeet DF Deet Master Banned Oct 25, 2017 61,987 Mar 28, 2020 #1,332 Andrea_23 said: A (technical superb) wiiu game : ).

Not sure if I would say Xenoblade has a more complex shading method. Zelda is also physically based. But the game being set in the outdoors means there is way fewer light sources and the material variation is much lower. But Zelda has been in development for much longer and enjoyed a way higher budget. Xenoblade 2 was made super fast. Even the Xenoblade 1 remake doesn't seem to exhibit the same issues so far so it seems like some of the problems have been ironed out Naga Alt account Banned Aug 29, 2019 7,850 Mar 28, 2020 #1,333 kodax_shc said: Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition (Collector's Set) Includes a 250 page artbook full of beautiful landscapes, a SteelBook, a vinyl featuring the Monado printed on the sleeve and a poster! www.game.co.uk It's up on GAME UK.

I'm guessing Xenoblade 2 fans are all over the new ones. I personaly feel like the characters are much more bland in the DE.Yeah, it's HD and polished, but bland. Good thing the japanese and english dubs both highly liked as well as the good animation stayed the same. But I really liked the faces expressions. It had a bit of a vagrant story or FF12 look to it, like, very special. I'm REALLY not digging the influence of Xenoblade 2 on Monolithsoft. Even the story sees details modified to fit 2. So the worse game (for me at least) dictates how the original must be ? Pretty sad if you ask me. But cool for fans of 2, hope they love 1 as well if they didn't play it yet. I'm still happy it's coming back so I can replay the game easily but maaan I wish I could have the Wii faces just HDed as an option. The rest of the body, I don't care.

They all have a very specific identity that blends characters with the scenery, the lighting in their own ways. The first Xenoblade had a very distinct look that just needed HD and a few tweaks, not... that. This doesn't even look like to be the same characters at all. Clearly a new character designer.

Well, surely Mono has encountered problems, it is beyond doubt. Zelda has a very advanced set of features, but the overall resource detail is much rarer than Chronicles 2. The latter, for example in cities, has shown a truly atypical detail density for Switch. Sometimes, in the most favorable scenarios, it seems to even go beyond the typical Ps4 game... Take also the fact that there are speculars applied even even hundreds of meters away from the player ... In general, I am also disappointed with the rendering balance of C2, and I would prefer less detail in favor of a higher resolution. Certainly, however, it cannot be said that the graphics engine is limited or has problems. It was used a little ... roughly, if anything.
