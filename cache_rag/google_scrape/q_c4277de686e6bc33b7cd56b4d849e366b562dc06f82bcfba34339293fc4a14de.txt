Players control an exiled witch who designs her own tarot deck and performs divinations for other witches. Gameplay [ edit ] After making a prediction that angers the leader of her coven, an immortal witch named Fortuna is banished to an asteroid for a thousand years.  After 200 years, she makes a bargain with an otherworldly creature to regain some power.  This allows her to design her own deck of cards, which she uses for tarot card reading .  Players can design these cards in an in-game editor, choosing and manipulating various props, backgrounds, and characters.  The assets used to design the cards have costs based on the classical elements (air, earth, fire, and water).  Other witches begin coming to Fortuna to have their fortunes told using her cards.  Players can, through dialogue choices, interpret the cards and learn more about these people.  Depending on the divinations players make during these interactions, they can acquire more of each elemental resource.  Fortuna's previous life can also be revealed through flashbacks, which involve minigames .  Players can also learn more about the world by researching in Fortuna's library.  Eventually, players can influence who the new coven leader is during an election by calling upon their newfound friends and taking advantage of what they have learned about the coven.
