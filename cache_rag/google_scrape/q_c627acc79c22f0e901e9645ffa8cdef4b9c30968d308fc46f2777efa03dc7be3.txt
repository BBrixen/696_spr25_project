If you count 33 months from GPT-4 release, that equals December 2025 for GPT-5.That would be exactly one and a half years from today, just like the timeframe that the OpenAI CTO said for PhD level intelligence being a year and a half from now: https://x.com/tsarnick/status/1803901130130497952 The above also lines up with the fact that the Nvidia CFO said himself recently that the new B100 and B200 GPUs "would not ramp up until 2025." and OpenAI only recently received the first H200 HGX in the past few months. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-does-not-expect-nvidia-190044549.html We know for sure that there was a draft blog post mistakenly published and quickly deleted by OpenAI that mentioned a planned GPT-4.5 model with a context length of 256K and a knowledge cut off of June 2024 . https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1bd0l8b/gpt_45_turbo_confirmed/ Mira Murati, the CTO of OpenAI said this at the end of the recent GPT-4o event right before it ended: "We also care a lot about the next frontier , so soon we'll be updating you on our progress towards the next big thing ." The display at the event also breifly said "Frontier models coming soon" while she said this. The fact that Mira murati said they will be showing us the next frontier ***soon ***, along with the other above points sounds like they're implying atleast a GPT-4.5 announcement within the next few months, this would be consistent with the draft blog post that OpenAI had previously accidentally published that said GPT-4.5 is releasing with a knowledge cut-off of June 2024. For the above reasons I think it is also likely that GPT-4.5 is the model that Microsoft said is currently training on their new supercomputer, especially since they never called it GPT-5 and they only ever referred to it as "the next sample.". Since they confirmed in May that it's training, then it might seem to some people that it's not possible that the the knowledge cut-off could be June 2024 like what was mentioned for the GPT-4.5 blog post, but it's actually not uncommon for a model to have a main training run on a dataset that is a bit older, and then towards the very end of the training run it has some continued training on a newer fresher and smaller dataset that can be trained on fairly quickly, the Llama-2 technical report is an example of this being done where the model training started in January 2023 but the knowledge cut-off in the final model is closer to July 2023. It's also entirely possible that OpenAI may have made some changes to the training plans for GPT-4.5 compared to when they wrote that blogpost, so its possible the knowledge cut-off of June 2024 is just off by a few months as well. TLDR; GPT-4.5 is possibly the new big model releasing in the next few months and currently being trained on Microsofts new super computer, this is fairly consistent with a mistakenly uploaded blog post that OpenAI published in the past, as well as consistent with Mira Murati teasing that new frontier models are coming soon after the GPT-4o event. A December 2025 release date for GPT-5 would be consistent with the 33 month gap that we previously saw between GPT-3 and GPT-4, and this would also be consistent with some claims that Mira recently had made about PhD level intelligence potentially coming in "a year and a half", this is further consistent with the new B200 GPU supply not expected to ramp up until early 2025.
