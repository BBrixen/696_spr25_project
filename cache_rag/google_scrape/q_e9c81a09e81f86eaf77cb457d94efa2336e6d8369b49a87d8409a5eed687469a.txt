Keller Fornes: Great American Family 'County Rescue' Star Dead At 32 It’s the beginning of the end of The Walking Dead , as the first part of the final season of the series will premiere Sunday, August 22 on AMC, as teased during tonight’s Season 10 finale. “Coming off of the six additional episodes for Season 10, which focused on smaller, character-driven stories, we’re excited to kick off Season 11 bigger than ever,” Angela Kang, showrunner and executive producer of The Walking Dead said via a press release provided to Decider. “The stakes will be high – we’ll see more zombies, tons of action, intriguing new stories, never-before-seen locations and our groups together in one community for the first time, trying to rebuild what the Whisperers took from them.” In case you’re a little confused about how all this is working, like most productions The Walking Dead was shut down because of COVID during March of 2020. Because of that, the show’s tenth season ended one episode before the ostensible finale, which pitted our post-apocalyptic heroes against the skin-wearing Whisperers. Once effects were done, the planned Season 10 finale was aired as a one-off special in October, 2020. And then AMC added an additional six episodes to the season (presumably at least in part in order to explore how to film a massive show like Walking Dead with COVID protocols in place), which finished airing tonight. Season 11, the final season, won’t make your planned viewing calendar any less complicated. The season will run over the course of 24 episodes, only eight of which will start airing on August 22, 2021. The other 16 episodes will air on dates TBD over the next two years, leading to the grand finale of the series some time in 2023. Oh, and those will lead into the premieres of two planned spin-offs , one focusing on Carol (Melissa McBride) and Daryl (Norman Reedus); the other an anthology series called Tales of the Walking Dead . Oh, and there’s a still-in-the-works theatrical series focused on Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), plus Fear the Walking Dead and The Walking Dead: World Beyond (which is coming back for one more season and then wrapping up). Point being, there’s plenty of Walking Dead coming your way. “The final chapter of The Walking Dead begins with eight action-packed episodes that will feature the massive scope and scale fans have come to expect from TWD Universe, and I’m thrilled to share that fans won’t have to wait long for these incredible new episodes to debut this summer,” Scott M. Gimple, chief content officer of TWD Universe, added. In the brief teaser that aired tonight — and which you can watch, above — we hear some of the questions asked by representatives of The Commonwealth , the massively advanced civilization that captured Ezekiel (Khary Payton), Eugene (Josh McDermitt), Princess (Paola Lázaro) and Yumiko (Eleanor Matsuura) at the end of last season. We also get to see the pristine setting known well to fans of the comics, including two locations vitally important to Michonne’s (Danai Gurira) story in the books (that would be the courtroom and the cake shop), so given she left the show, it’ll be interesting to see which character takes her place in the storyline. My money is on Yumiko. Check out the teaser above, and start your countdown to the slow, shambling end of The Walking Dead .
