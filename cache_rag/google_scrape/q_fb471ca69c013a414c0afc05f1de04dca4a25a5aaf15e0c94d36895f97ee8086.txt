For now, the shop at 803 Shirley remains open. In a neighborhood known for its walkability and tight-knit community, Less Than has found the perfect home. Found in Ghent, this zero-waste and refill shop is all about revolution—the kind rooted in sustainability, mindfulness and spending dollars locally. Store founder Chris Simmonds didn’t originally have “become a retail pioneer” on his bingo card, but here we are. “We came about out of necessity,” he says. “There just wasn’t anywhere like this in town.” Originally launched online, Less Than quickly evolved. After a short stint in a mobile tiny home converted into a rolling storefront, COVID accelerated Simmonds’ timeline and the move to a permanent brick-and-mortar space. By May 2020, Simmonds opened the doors at 803 Shirley Ave.—just as much of the world was closing its own. Five Years in Ghent The shop celebrates its fifth anniversary this spring, and it’s not hard to see why it’s still going strong. Less Than offers everything from bulk soaps and cleaning supplies to sustainable personal care, baby items and pet goods. Each item comes in compostable, refillable or packaging-free forms. Customers can bring their own containers or pick from sanitized community-donated jars, then refill as they see fit. Of course, Less Than sells much more than soap. The store’s philosophy is rooted in changing people’s daily habits. “The most sustainable product is the one you already have,” Simmonds says. “You don’t have to replace everything overnight. Start small. Get just a few ounces. See what works.” Inside, the store is split into intentional zones: one area offers self-care gifts like mindful games and journaling kits, while the refill station stocks everyday essentials like laundry detergent, dish soap and facial cleansers. The only thing that’s missing is synthetic fragrances and dyes. Local makers contribute to the shop’s unique inventory, too: Norfolk seamstresses provide reusable cloths, face rounds and even mop heads, keeping more dollars circulating locally. Ceremony Three years ago, the shop expanded to include Ceremony, a curated non-alcoholic bottle shop that features zero-proof spirits, functional drinks with adaptogens and a variety of mixers. It’s another extension of the store’s ethos—helping people meet their needs without compromise, whether they’re sober-curious or just looking for something new. For travelers living a low-waste lifestyle, Less Than is a destination all its own. “People seek us out when they visit Norfolk,” says Simmonds, noting that vegetarians, zero-waste enthusiasts and sober travelers often arrive knowing exactly what they’re looking for—or discovering it for the first time. Ghent locals already know the place is a gem. Residents routinely drop in for quick refills, eco-friendly gifts or just to see what’s new in stock. Less Than is just that way: unassuming, warm and rooted in a bigger purpose. Less Than is open Tuesday–Saturday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday from 12 to 5 p.m. Closed Mondays. Delivery available within Norfolk.

Over the decades, Kern has won some of classical music’s highest honors and dazzled audiences from Moscow to Manhattan. But this spring, she’s right at home in Norfolk. “I’m here every year,” she says. “It’s a big visit — and a big part of my musical year.” Kern, a Russian-American pianist with a vibrant stage presence and a clear love for repertoire that’s on the Romantic side, is back for the Virginia Arts Festival’s 2025 season with not one, but two Norfolk performances —  and a lineup of collaborators that span continents and traditions. She’ll first appear May 22 alongside the much-acclaimed Zemlinsky Quartet, tackling Dvořák’s fiery Piano Quintet No. 2 . Then, on June 11 , she returns to lead a series of chamber concerts alongside the Virginia Arts Festival Chamber Players. Kern will be joined by local artists and international guests. Kern has become a fixture of the Virginia Arts Festival’s chamber music series — more than just a performer, she’s also its artistic director. It’s a role she says she enjoys immensely. “As a pianist, it’s rare to get this kind of opportunity — to really dedicate time to chamber music. Usually it’s all recitals and concertos,” she says. “But here, I get to invite the musicians I most want to work with. Every year is different, and that’s what makes it exciting.” Schubert and More Among the many highlights is Schubert’s “Trout Quintet,” an unconventional piece that includes the double bass — unusual for chamber settings and, as Kern says, a key part of the magic. “It gives it such a deep, warm sound. It’s exciting for piano, too. There’s a lot to play,” she says. “Everyone knows the theme — people may not realize it, but it’s one of those melodies that lives in the culture.” That accessibility is something Kern cares deeply about. She knows that for some audiences, chamber music can feel intimidating or opaque, but that’s not how she sees it. “This music comes from the heart,” she says. “It’s meant to be shared, not understood like some academic text. Even with contemporary pieces — we choose ones that are fun to hear. It’s all about making it easy to enjoy.” For someone whose career spans major concert halls and festivals around the world, Kern remains firmly grounded. Perhaps this can be attributed to her roots — both her parents were pianists, and her connection to the Romantic tradition runs deep (she’s even distantly related to Anna Petrovna Kern, the muse of Russian poet Alexander Pushkin). Or maybe it’s her energy, which is equally intense on stage and off – as when chatting via Zoom about the upcoming Norfolk shows. Seeing Colors in Music Kern has often spoken of “seeing” color in music. “Some pieces feel like blue, others gold or silver. Rachmaninoff is red. Mozart feels more classical — maybe gold. Beethoven? Sometimes blue. I talk to my designer about all of this,” she says. “It’s part of the show.” As for newcomers, Kern offers one piece of advice: Come as you are. “Don’t be afraid of classical music,” she says. “You’ll hear something you recognize, even if you think you haven’t. It’s in the movies, the culture. It all came from here.” Previous Post Next Post You May Also Like Blog Less Than: Ghent Zero-Waste Refill Shop Turns Five Less Than803 Shirley Ave., Norfolk, VA    Follow on Instagram… Learn More Blog STEAM Field Trip Ideas for Student Groups Looking to apply the concepts of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math)… Learn More Blog Band Student Performance Tours in Norfolk Norfolk, Virginia offers students an endless array of opportunities to explore, perform… Learn More Blog Corporate Social Responsibility Opportunities in Norfolk Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate… Learn More See All 17 April 2025 Three Days in Norfolk for NATO Festival and Virginia International Tattoo Blog It’s that time of year once again: the time when Norfolk rolls out its red carpet and invites locals and visitors to enjoy a unique blend of global culture and naval tradition during the Virginia International Tattoo and NATO Festival, April 24-26, 2025.

This revitalized waterfront area is a hub of activity with restaurants, bars and entertainment with lovely views of the Elizabeth River to boot. Afternoon: For a change of pace, visit the Chrysler Museum of Art . Its extensive collection spans various periods and styles, with a notable focus on glass art. It’s a great place to relax and enjoy some culture. The newly-opened Perry Glass Studio is also worth a look for its free glass-blowing demonstrations.

In fact, it’s what inspired her to open her new shop on 21st Street in Ghent, where the browsing is as inviting as a summer evening on a Southern porch. Quattlebaum, a North Carolina native, brings a touch of Southern hospitality and style to this carefully curated boutique. With a background in education and a passion for unique finds, Quattlebaum envisioned a space where women could discover that “little something” special – and often leave with much more. The name itself is a nod to the experience of many first-time shoppers to the store. “Women will come in and say, ‘I’m just looking for a little something,'” Quattlebaum says, recognizing it as an unspoken request for assistance in finding the perfect item. Stepping into “A Little Something” is like entering a stylish home. Quattlebaum’s husband, who handled the construction, created a welcoming backdrop with hardwood floors and a thoughtfully designed interior. The shop is a delightful mix of color and texture, showcasing Quattlebaum’s finds from her travels. Here, shoppers can browse a diverse selection, from dressy apparel suitable for special events and fun athletic wear like tennis skirts, to unique home goods. You’ll also find fragrant candles – including the ever-popular lotion candles – and even laundry detergent that adds “a little something” to your next load of laundry. Accessories are aplenty, with costume and 14-karat gold jewelry, stylish bags and even some fun cocktail mixers. Quattlebaum’s Southern roots shine through in offerings like Lily Pulitzer-esque coolers and a general appreciation for classic, quality pieces. Quattlebaum praises the collaborative spirit of her fellow 21st Street merchants. “If someone goes to one store and they can’t find what they’re looking for, they’ll say, ‘Oh, try A Little Something,'” she says. “We all kind of uplift each other.” While Quattlebaum curates items from across the country, she’s also open to featuring local vendors who meet her standards of quality and uniqueness. Aside from offering a delightful shopping experience, Quattlebaum’s true passion lies in helping women feel confident. “I don’t really believe in trends,” she says. “I believe in a woman who walks into a room with self-confidence, and I want to make sure she feels that when she leaves here.” A Little Something 325 W. 21st St. Norfolk, VA Follow on Instagram Previous Post Next Post You May Also

Over the past year, Owner Phillip James has morphed a small space into a culinary haven, earning coveted five-star Google ratings and a loyal following. James’ journey to restaurateur diverges from the usual script. Instead of attending culinary school or working as a line cook, James spent seven years in the Army. After that, he spent nearly a decade working as a contractor and DOD employee in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Turkey. “I lived in Maryland for a while, dipped my toes into the dining scene there,” James recounts. “But then, another deployment, and eventually, I found myself in Norfolk.” Initially, James’ plan was to open a food truck. But when a small storefront became available, James saw an opportunity. “I didn’t want to go too big,” he says. “This space felt perfect. We opened in January 2024, and last year, we did pretty well.” The menu at PJay’s is a vibrant mix of street-inspired dishes, carefully chosen to fill a void in the local culinary landscape. “I wanted to offer something different,” James says. “No fried seafood, no po’boys on the block (of Granby). I looked for what was missing and drew inspiration from there.” The result is a menu that boasts mouthwatering oxtail, perfectly executed fried seafood baskets, and soon, a lunch menu featuring po’boys and tacos. Rasta pasta and jerk chicken and shrimp are also fan favorites. “It’s a micro-diner experience,” James says, offering 14 seats inside and 16 outside. James’s culinary journey is largely self-taught, fueled by a lifelong love of cooking and a desire to learn. “I grew up with my grandmother, picking up things subconsciously,” he says. “When I joined the Army, I cooked in the barracks. Some of it wasn’t good, but I was trying.” He credits his mentor, JR Robinson of D.C.’s KitchenCray, with shaping his approach to the business. “When I started taking this seriously, I reached out to him,” James says. “He’s been instrumental in my growth, teaching me about the business side, understanding margins, and cutting costs without compromising quality.” Despite the success of PJay’s, James continues to work his corporate job in satellite communications. “We exceeded the goals we set for ourselves,” he says of PJay’s, “but I still have my other job.” The influence of his mother and grandmother is revealed in every dish. “They’re from a culture known for not measuring ingredients,” James explains. “They just had it honed. I’m trying to figure out if I should write those recipes down.” He also dreams of one day legitimizing his grandmother’s legacy of selling food and alcohol. Key to PJay’s success is Tamila Spruill, James’s childhood friend and the backbone of the operation. “She’s been here from the beginning,” James says. “She handles things without me even being contacted. She’s consistent, on time, and a thriving force for PJay’s. I appreciate her for coming on this journey with me.” Each plate James and Spruill serve us tells a story: of hard work, grit, and the unwavering pursuit of flavor. Not convinced? Just take it from those who’ve eaten there. Currently, PJay’s enjoys a coveted 4.9 star rating on Google with more than 476 reviews and counting.

The recent expansion, roughly six years in the making, helps the studio deal with previous capacity constraints while allowing for a broader range of programming, said Ashley Grove Mars, Director of Communications for the Chrysler Museum. “We were really getting to capacity with our partner classes,” said Mars. “This expansion allows us to welcome more students, visiting artists and offer diverse educational experiences.” First impressions are everything, and visitors to the Perry Glass Studio will be wowed by the state-of-the-art hot shop and theater, now capable of seating 200, equipped with cutting-edge lighting, sound, and monitor systems. The new facility also features dedicated classrooms, metal, mold and wood shops, along with a catering kitchen, creating a one-stop artistic hub. Planners have worked hard to continue the Perry’s commitment to accessibility with free daily noon demonstrations, allowing anyone to get an up-close look at the intense process of glassblowing. The expansion was also undertaken to draw a wider range of artists, with rental spaces and specialized equipment available for independent projects and visiting professionals. To celebrate, the Chrysler Museum is hosting a grand opening weekend, March 29-30, 2025, offering a blend of artistic showcase and community engagement. Saturday, March 29th : “ Glass & Glitz: Grand Gathering and Auction ,” is a ticketed gala ($129 per person) featuring live glass blowing demonstrations by renowned artists Dante Marioni and Corey Pemberton , alongside musical performances by Kishi Bashi and BJ Griffin.

Designed to get visitors into the fun, the “Oaxaca Central Passport” program invites the community to explore local creative experiences.
