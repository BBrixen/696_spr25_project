(Xenoblade Chronicles 2) Applies to: Nintendo Switch Family, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite, Nintendo Switch - OLED Model The content included in the Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Expansion Pass is the same content that is included in Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna ~ The Golden Country. Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna The Golden Country includes the same story that is included in the Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Expansion Pass, and a download code for packs 1-4 of the Expansion Pass DLC (playable in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 only). Ways to Purchase: There are two ways to get the full content: Xenoblade Chronicles 2 + Expansion Pass (includes DLC Packs 1-4 and the Torna story) Xenoblade Chronicles 2 + Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna (includes a download code for DLC Packs 1-4, playable in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 only) Because the content in the Expansion Pass is the same content included in Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna ~ The Golden Country, there is no reason to purchase both items.
