We almost didn't even get the first game at all and now XCX is coming to every retailer in all regions, including the SE. +3 Johnw1104 Skullwaker (on 29 August 2015) Really feels like a quality RPG is missing from the Wii U... I'm so glad we're getting this game. 0 Skullwaker Skullwaker (on 29 August 2015) There are some but very few (if any) are unique to the Wii U, which is unfortunate. This game and Genei Ibun Roku #FE should really fill that gap. A Paper Mario would help also, but I'm not holding my breath for that one. +1 quisuis (on 29 August 2015) is it coming to Canada ..if so where i can PO +3 PAOerfulone (on 30 August 2015) Aaaaaand it sold out already. Jesus, that special edition got outta here faster than a Barry Bonds home run in Yankee Stadium. +2 johnsobas (on 31 August 2015) currently ranked #4 on US amazon and sold out. +1 Nuvendil johnsobas (on 31 August 2015) Hopefully Nintendo sees the success and doubles that initial shipment.  Clearly there's hype, need to take advantage of it. 0 PAOerfulone (on 29 August 2015) Already pre-ordered, baby!! XD Now to with 3 and a half agonizing months... +1 PAOerfulone PAOerfulone (on 29 August 2015) *wait 0 Johnw1104 PAOerfulone (on 29 August 2015) It's already available? Kewl...
