Reddington demands the release of fellow Blacklister Marvin Gerard ( Fisher Stevens ) a former top defense lawyer, who Red wants to help decode the Fulcrum and expose the Cabal.

Liz tracks the gang down by taking one of their members hostage to trade for Reddington. The exchange, which also involves the item Dembe had retrieved, is interrupted by the FBI, and Ressler arrests Liz after a lengthy chase, while Reddington escapes. Cooper and Tom find themselves being pursued by Solomon's men, and must protect Karakurt from being killed and prevented from confessing to the OREA bombing. The hunt for Solomon takes Reven Wright to Laurel Hitchin, who helped Solomon when he worked for the CIA.

The Director and Hitchin, hoping to prevent her from testifying, arrange to remove Liz from the box before the Marshals arrive. Aram, determined to protect Liz from the Director, changes the door code to the box to keep the Director from taking Liz. The Director resorts to flooding the box with nitrogen, suffocating Liz, to force Aram to give up the door code.

With Ressler's help, they fend off an assault by Solomon and his men, who have tracked them to the cabin, and arrest Solomon in the process. Ressler returns to the post office quickly enough to prevent the Director from taking Liz, and warn Hitchin that he knows that she killed Wright. Reddington and Samar manage to retrieve the case the FBI took. The case, containing state-of-the-art printing plates for money, created from the software upgrades General Ludd stole from the U.S. Treasury , is Reddington's leverage to get Venezuela to agree to help him and Liz and help take down the Cabal. 54 10 "The Director: Conclusion" No. 24 John Terlesky Lukas Reiter January 14, 2016 ( 2016-01-14 ) 7.47 [ 13 ] Reddington secretly meets with the task force while Ressler brings Liz to the federal courthouse and protects her there. Through an elaborate ruse, Reddington and the task force kidnap the Director and bring him to Venezuela's foreign minister, who intends to have the Director brought before The Hague on war crimes charges. Using the prospect of an American official being tried for war crimes as leverage, Reddington strikes a deal with Laurel Hitchin through Marvin Gerard, his attorney who helped him to design the plan to prove Liz's innocence. Thanks to Tom safely delivering Karakurt to the federal courthouse to confess to the OREA bombing and the Senator's murder, Gerard is able to get the U.S. government to drop all the charges against Liz except an involuntary manslaughter charge from the killing of Attorney General Tom Connolly. The plea deal prevents Liz from going to jail but also prevents her from returning to the FBI, unless as an asset to the task force. Hitchin issues a public apology to Liz, and also reveals both the existence of the Cabal and Connolly and the Director's involvement in it. With Liz finally set free, Ressler hands Cooper his old post as head of the task force. With Hitchin's permission, Reddington, kills the Director to rid the Cabal of a liability. Reddington and Hitchin meet afterwards to discuss involving him in the Cabal. 55 11 "Mr. Gregory Devry" No. 95 Alex Zakrzewski Daniel Knauf January 21, 2016 ( 2016-01-21 ) 7.42 [ 14 ] Liz, though exonerated, finds adjusting to normal life difficult without being an FBI agent.

In response, Reddington has the task force look into a gathering of criminals which includes Caligiuri, and their hunt leads them to a man ( Jake Weber ) who claims to be Raymond Reddington. In the box at the post office, the impostor warns the task force that Caligiuri plans to kidnap an FBI executive to expose Reddington as an informant. The kidnapping succeeds, which forces the task force to offer the impostor immunity in exchange for infiltrating the criminal gathering. The real Reddington, however, joins the meeting first, and the late-arriving impostor is then falsely presented as the FBI asset hired by Caligiuri to betray the gathering of criminals. Both are then killed by Reddington, restoring his reputation among his fellow criminals. Beyond suspicion once again, Reddington tells Liz the impostor was his friend, Gregory Devry, a con man who specialised in conning other criminals, was dying of cancer who sacrificed himself to help Reddington. Meanwhile, Tom proposes to Liz again, a prospect that Reddington explicitly forbids.

Reddington, not convinced that his associate was a pedophile, suspects that someone involved in money laundering is controlling them to also eliminate the competition. The investigation leads Reddington to a priest who has been using the Vehm to target money launderers under the pretense of murdering pedophiles. Reddington then turns the Vehm on the priest by convincing them they were tricked. The priest is killed, and the Vehm become allied with Reddington. Meanwhile, Liz ponders whether to keep the baby she is about to have, or put the baby up for adoption. Reddington tracks down Liz's assailant and promptly kills him.

The contract of this killing, which puts the blame of the killing to the US government, is protected by The Caretaker ( Reg E. Cathey ). Reddington then introduces Keen to this case who then, via the FBI, interrogates the Chinese-American to reveal his method of communication with the Caretaker. After getting to know that underground pipes by US post are used, Reddington, Keen, and Dembe pay a visit to one of Reddingtons's clients of which The Caretaker is also a client. Simultaneously, Tom confronts Gina Zanetakos on the intent of peace which leads to a fight between the two. Reddington provides the location of The Caretaker to Ressler and Navabi who hunt down The Caretaker, who is digging up a canister from a corpse in the cemetery. Upon interrogation, he says that he was releasing the canister to a group which had abducted his daughter. This canister involved a contract between an airline and the Germans. Upon further investigation, it is found out that the group of terrorists that orchestrated an attack on the airline has acquired a metric ton of C4 which via Reddington is located, but that truck contains a bomb made of that C4, which was triggered after Ressler shot the person holding the button. With the bomb squad 12 minutes away and the bomb exploding in 2, the duo enlists Aram's help via phone on defusing the bomb, which is completed in remaining 9 seconds.
