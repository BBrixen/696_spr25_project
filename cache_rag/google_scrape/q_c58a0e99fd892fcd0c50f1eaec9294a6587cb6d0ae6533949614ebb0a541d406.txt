For the first time, take Turf War battles on-the-go via local multiplayer in portable play styles. You can also compete in frenetic online matches like before. Two years have passed since the release of Splatoon, and two years have also passed in the game world, leading to an evolution in fashion trends and new styles of weapons and gear. Staying fresh never looked so good. New maps. New weapons. New subweapons. New dual-wielded weapons. Jetpacks. Will feature stage and weapon updates post-launch.
