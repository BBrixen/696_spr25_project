I said nothing nasty about the match lol.  It wasn’t high quality.  Barty against Kerber was high quality. Pliskova’s performance against Sabalenka was high quality.  This was not Reactions: Pass750 and AM75 Bartelby Bionic Poster Jul 10, 2021 #713 Does it even occur to you that you are responsible for this mild interchange becoming such a drama? stringertom said: So it’s cool to fight fire by adding napalm to the flames?

Tennis Fan States63 Hall of Fame Jul 10, 2021 #715 Aussie Darcy said: Have to feel for Pliskova. Now 0/2 in slam finals but so was Caroline Wozniacki and Simona Halep. Click to expand... KP can learn from this match with some good coaching.  The tentativeness really showed but so did her potential.  Also against a champion/quality opponent, you can't afford such a slow start.

The people your defending constantly criticized and ridiculed this match and the tour and I am truly sorry I wrote one sentence that was a bit over the top but when you have to put up with the **** I do here day in day out, you can hopefully forgive a one sentence blip. I won't go into what the trolls have done to me on this forum the last few days alone but you don't know where i'm coming from. Reactions: speedysteve -NN- G.O.A.T.

How would Osaka cope with the losing on court interview at Wimbledon? Jokervich Hall of Fame Jul 10, 2021 #727 Hitman said: So, what are her chances to win USO and AO? Click to expand... Probably not very high. Apart from Osaka on hard courts, every slam in the womens game has a different winner. This is what the mens game will be like once Djokovic, Federer and Nadal retire. bertrevert Legend Jul 10, 2021 #728 reaper said: The Australian Open seems to be a very tough one for Australians to win.

They haven't played for a couple of years and Osaka has been dominating Slams on HC and Barty has been winning on clay and grass. There will be huge anticipation for their next Slam matches.

So for the Barty/Pliskova match: Barty: W/UE 30/29 Pliskova: W/UE 27/32 Barty/Kerber Barty: W/UE 38/16 Kerber : W/UE 16/23 Pliskova/Sabalenka: Pliskova: W/UE 32/17 Sabalenka: 38/20 Pretty resounding winners over UE for quite a few matches. Barty with more winners than UE in both the SF and Final.

What isn’t right is the first words from you not being, “Sorry, that was uncalled for.” Instead it’s a whiny victim card, “Oh, I’ve been beat up!” excuse. 2 wrongs don’t make a right.

Would love to see you do and post more for the women's tour on here against the constant sexist vitriol me and others have to put up with but i'm so glad you're here for one sentence. Hope you pop up when people tell me how women belong in the kitchen or on their knees or are relying on the men to get them by. Keep fighting the good fight. Brian11785 Hall of Fame Jul 10, 2021 #746 Great win for Barty. Didn't think she had the level after the first couple rounds but I'm happy to be proven wrong. As far as the drama goes, I've put on ignore the Negative Nancys long ago. My message board experience is greatly enchanted.
