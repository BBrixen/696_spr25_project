Members Online • 556mm Pixel 6 Pro Pre-Ordered and Arriving Today (10/23) Not sure if this is a mistake or they're just shipping early. But I ordered a black Pixel 6 Pro, nothing else, it shipped out via FedEx on Friday (yesterday) and is out for delivery today. I did not preorder from Google but my wireless carrier due to Google giving me a December delivery date. I have not seen anything from Google about launching/selling/shipping before the 10/28 launch date. Anyone else seeing this?  Marked as Rumour currently as I haven't yet confirmed the contents of the delivery is what it is supposed to be. Update: Pixel 6 Pro arrived and I just set it up. So far, seems good. Haven't played around with it much yet. The in screen finger print reader is a little slower than a dedicated reader. Its more of touch and hold for a half second than touch and instant unlock. That's my big takeaway so far. Update 2: Geekbench 5 score: https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/10572171 Update 3: Ran Geekbench 5 again, scores a little higher but close, 1040 and 2814. Update 4: Wild Life 3dMark test results:  Overall score 6,595 with an avg FPS of 39.50. Update 5: Final update. Software update for the Camera is now available. Enjoy! Read more Archived post.
