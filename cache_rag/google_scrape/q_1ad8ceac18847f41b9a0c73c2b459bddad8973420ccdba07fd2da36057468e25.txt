[ 32 ] However, days later the White House Press Secretary , Sarah Huckabee Sanders , stated that the United States "looks forward to participating" and will attend. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Concerns were later assuaged. [ 35 ] Coin toss controversy [ edit ] Luge athlete Erin Hamlin carried the flag during the opening ceremony. Following a vote, which ended up in a 4-4 tie between Hamlin and speed skater Shani Davis , the winner was decided via a coin toss in accordance with the rules. Davis eventually skipped the opening ceremony, citing his training schedule.
