The German former world No. 1 used fantastic defence to beat Williams 6-3, 6-3. The American was never able to take the upper hand in the rallies and made too many mistakes in crucial moments. Kerber started the first set on fire, breaking Williams' serve in the first game and holding for a 2-0 lead. The German appeared determined to drag out the rallies as much as possible, and it got Williams in all kinds of early trouble.

As shared by SI Tennis, one enormous ace stood out: But while Williams' powerful attack was a huge weapon, so was Kerber's defence. The 30-year-old played with remarkable patience, covering tons of ground and keeping her older opponent moving. It resulted in a second break in the seventh game, and with a good hold, she moved within one of the set win. Tennis writer Ben Rothenberg was impressed with how she kept Williams on her toes: One game later, the set was over after yet another break. SI Now 's Jon Wertheim wasn't ready to write off the veteran, but he didn't like her chances: The two traded holds of serve to start the second set, and Williams' movement was a little better than it was in the first set, with Kerber forced to run all over the court. But there were still too many errors and inconsistencies, perhaps best highlighted when she missed a routine smash at the net. And as the set wore on, fatigue started to set in, with Kerber's momentum increasing. Williams' resolve finally wilted in the sixth game, when Kerber found the break she had been looking for with some clean winners. Tennis writer Jose Morgado was in awe: A quick hold later, Kerber was a game away from her first Wimbledon title, and while Williams fended off the end on serve, she couldn't find a break herself. Making it to the final just months after her return to tennis is still a remarkable achievement for Williams, but she was decisively beaten on Saturday. 05:36 NFL Draft Winners/Losers ðŸ“Š TOP NEWS NFL Draft Night 1 Grades ðŸ”  Bleacher Report 20h Day 2 Predictions ðŸ”® Bleacher Report 7h Best Remaining Players ðŸ™‹ Bleacher Report 7h Deion Reacts to Shedeur Sliding in Draft Bleacher Report 6h ðŸ“Š Where Cavs Stand in our Playoff Power Rankings Bleacher Report 7h TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report â€¢ 19h NFL Draft 2025 Results and Live Tracking Every Pick for All Selections Bleacher Report â€¢ 7h 2025 MLB Mock Draft 4.0 for Every 1st-round Pick Find out who the Mets take with their first-round pick ðŸ“² Bleacher Report â€¢ 5h Shedeur Sanders' Talent Reportedly Causing NFL Draft Slide, Not Off-Field Concerns Bleacher Report â€¢ 5h Ashton Jeanty Will Be 2nd-Highest Paid NFL RB with $32M Guaranteed in Raiders Contract Bleacher Report â€¢ 3h Jaguars, Browns Reportedly Agreed to Travis Hunter Trade Framework Weeks Before Draft TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report â€¢ 19h NFL Draft 2025 Results and Live Tracking Every Pick for All Selections Bleacher Report â€¢ 7h 2025 MLB Mock Draft 4.0 for Every 1st-round Pick Find out who the Mets take with their first-round pick ðŸ“² Bleacher Report â€¢ 5h Shedeur Sanders' Talent Reportedly Causing NFL Draft Slide, Not Off-Field Concerns Bleacher Report â€¢ 5h Ashton Jeanty Will Be 2nd-Highest Paid NFL RB with $32M Guaranteed in Raiders Contract Bleacher Report â€¢ 3h Jaguars, Browns Reportedly Agreed to Travis Hunter Trade Framework Weeks Before Draft Bleacher Report About Advertise Contact Us Get Help Careers Sitemap Community Guidelines Privacy Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information Terms Of Use AdChoices B/R Sports on MAX B/R Creators Program Copyright Â© 2025 Bleacher Report, Inc.
