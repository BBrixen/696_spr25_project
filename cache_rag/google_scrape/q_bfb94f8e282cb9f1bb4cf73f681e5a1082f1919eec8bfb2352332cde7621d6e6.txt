Sal Romano Oct 27 2020 / 12:43 PM EDT 0 CD Projekt RED has delayed Cybeprunk 2077 from its previously announced November 19 release date to December 10. It will be available for PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , PC via Steam , Epic Games Store , and GOG , and Stadia at launch, followed by PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series at a later date. Get the full message on the delay from CD Projekt RED below. Hey everyone, Today, we’ve decided to move the release date of Cyberpunk 2077 by 21 days. The new release date is December 10. Most likely, there are many emotions and questions in your heads, so, first and foremost, please accept our humble apologies. The biggest challenge for us right now is shipping the game on current-gen, next-gen, and PC at the same time, which requires us to prepare and test nine versions of it (Xbox One / X, compatibility on Xbox Series S / X, PlayStation 4 / Pro, compatibility on PlayStation 5, PC, Stadia)… while working from home. Since Cyberpunk 2077 evolved towards almost being a next-gen title somewhere along the way, we need to make sure everything works well and every version runs smoothly. We’re aware it might seem unrealistic when someone says that 21 days can make any difference in such a massive and complex game, but they really do. Some of you might also be wondering what these words mean in light of us saying we achieved gold master some time ago. Passing certification, or “going gold,” means the game is ready, can be completed, and has all content in it. But it doesn’t mean we stop working on it and raising the quality bar. On the contrary, this is the time where many improvements are being made which will then be distributed via a Day 0 patch. This is the time period we undercalculated. We feel we have an amazing game on our hands and are willing to make every decision, even the hardest ones, if it ultimately leads to you getting a video game you’ll fall in love with.
