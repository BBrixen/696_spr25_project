By ATP Staff Novak Djokovic clinched his record-extending eighth ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by Pepperstone finish on Sunday when he defeated Holger Rune in his opening match at the Nitto ATP Finals . After a back-and-forth battle for the honour with Carlos Alcaraz throughout the 2023 season, Djokovic has emerged on top. The Serbian also extended his record as oldest year-end No. 1 in Pepperstone ATP Rankings history. Two years ago he was the oldest to finish the season in top spot aged 34, and he has beaten his own mark by repeating the feat aged 36. Djokovic is now two year-end No. 1 finishes clear of Pete Sampras , who is second on the historic list with six year-end No. 1 campaigns. The Serbian has earned the honour in eight of the past 13 seasons.

Djokovic has spent 25 weeks in top spot in 2023. World No. 1 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings changed seven times this year between the Serbian and Alcaraz. A winner of six titles so far this season — tied for the most on the ATP Tour with Alcaraz — Djokovic won three of the season’s four majors. He lifted the trophy at the Australian Open , Roland Garros and the US Open . Now a 24-time major champion, Djokovic captured three Slams in a year for the fourth time in his career (also 2011, 2015 and 2021). He stands alone with the most major titles in the history of men’s tennis. The 36-year-old triumphed in Cincinnati and Paris to add two more ATP Masters 1000 trophies to his collection. Djokovic has now won a record 40 titles at that elite level.

Novak continues to set the standard in tennis, and his passion and drive make him a true champion. There’s no doubt that more greatness and records lie ahead in his journey.” Read More News View All News View Related Videos View All Videos PROFILE View All {{playerData.PlayerFirstName}} {{playerData.PlayerLastName}} Rank {{playerData.PlayerRank}} 1st Serve points won {{playerData.PlayerFirstServePointsWon}} Aces {{playerData.Aces}} Career Win/Loss {{playerData.CareerWinLoss}} Service Games Won {{playerData.ServiceGamesWon}} DOWNLOAD OFFICIAL ATP WTA LIVE APP Partners icon-facebook icon-x icon-instagram icon-youtube icon-linkedin2 © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc.
