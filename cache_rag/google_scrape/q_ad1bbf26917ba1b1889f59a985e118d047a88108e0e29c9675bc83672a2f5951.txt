[ 2 ] As before, the tournament featured 12 male teams – nine of the ten Test -playing nations and three associate nations, which earned their places through a qualification tournament . ICC Full member Zimbabwe were expelled from the tournament due to political reasons. Matches were played at three English grounds – Lord's and The Oval in London , and Trent Bridge in Nottingham . The tournament was organised in parallel with the women's tournament , with the men's semi-finals and final being preceded by the semi-finals and final from the women's event. The final took place at Lord's on Sunday 21 June with Pakistan beating Sri Lanka by eight wickets and England beating New Zealand by six wickets in the women's final . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Background [ edit ] In June 2006, The Daily Telegraph reported that the Marylebone Cricket Club and Surrey CCC had put in a joint bid to host the tournament at Lord's and The Oval . [ 5 ] In December 2007, the ICC provisionally approved a Women's World Twenty20 to run alongside the men's event which, subject to the approval of the ICC's finance and commercial affairs committee, would come into effect for the 2009 tournament in England. [ 6 ] In early January 2008, speculation arose that the tournament could be held elsewhere as the British government have banned Zimbabwe from touring England in 2009. However, it was later confirmed that the tournament would definitely take place in the country. In April 2008, the third venue was confirmed as Nottingham's Trent Bridge ; the 17,500 seater stadium was chosen to hold one of the semi-finals, among other earlier matches. Lord's and The Oval are the two other confirmed venues, with the opening match and final being played at Lord's. Old Trafford Cricket Ground had bid for the third venue, but Trent Bridge was chosen for its closer proximity to the two London grounds. Qualification [ edit ] Teams from every ICC Region : Africa (1) South Africa Americas (1) West Indies Asia (4) Bangladesh India Pakistan Sri Lanka East Asia-Pacific (2) Australia New Zealand Europe (4) England (host) Ireland Netherlands Scotland Although early reports suggested the 2009 event may involve just eight teams in a nine-day event, [ 7 ] the full twelve-team tournament was confirmed, featuring the Test -playing nations and two qualifying associate nations. However, in July 2008 Zimbabwe, under pressure from South Africa and England over political matters related to Robert Mugabe , pulled out of the tournament of their own volition, creating an additional space for an associate nation. Qualification was achieved by the finalists of an ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier held in Belfast from 2–4 August 2008, between Kenya , Scotland , Ireland , Netherlands , Canada and Bermuda . [ 8 ] Ireland and the Netherlands, having reached the final, qualified outright, while Scotland won the third place playoff beating Kenya to also qualify. [ 9 ] Venues [ edit ] The matches were played at the following three grounds: Nottingham London London Trent Bridge Lord's The Oval Capacity: 17,500 Capacity: 28,000 Capacity: 23,500 Trent Bridge The Oval Lord's Rules and regulations [ edit ] During the group stage and Super Eight, points are awarded to the teams as follows: Result Points Win 2 points No result 1 point Loss 0 points In case of a tie (i.e. both teams score the same number of runs at the end of their respective innings), a Super Over decides the winner. This applies in all stages of the tournament. [ 10 ] Within each group (both group stage and Super Eight stage), teams are ranked against each other based on the following criteria: [ 11 ] Higher number of points If equal, higher number of wins If still equal, higher net run rate If still equal, lower bowling strike rate If still equal, result of head-to-head meeting. Groups [ edit ] The groups were announced on 31 October 2007, based on finishing positions at the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and the successful qualifying associate nations. The initial four group format is the same as that used at the 2007 tournament. Team seed in brackets.

Super 8s [ edit ] The Super 8s consisted of two groups: Group E and Group F. Group E consisted of A1, B2, C1, D2 and Group F consisted of A2, B1, C2, D1, where X1 is the first seed from Group X and X2 is the second seed from Group X. The seedings were based on performance in the last ICC T20 (2007). If a non-seeded team knocks out a seeded team, the non-seeded team inherits the seed of the team it knocked out.
