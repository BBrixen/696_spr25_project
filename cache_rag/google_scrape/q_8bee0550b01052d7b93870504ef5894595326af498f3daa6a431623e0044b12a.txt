The COVID-19 pandemic had forced the cancellation of the Championship in 2020, but crowds of up to 32,000 per day were able to descend upon Sandwich as Shane Lowry belatedly defended the Claret Jug he had claimed in such memorable fashion at Royal Portrush two years earlier. Those in attendance were treated to glorious weather for all four days of the Championship and a truly dazzling performance from Morikawa, who became the first man to win on his first appearance at two different majors having previously triumphed at the 2020 PGA Championship. A nerveless, bogey-free 66 on the final day ensured Morikawa, whose iron play was typically brilliant throughout the week, prevailed with a 15-under aggregate of 265 – a record at Royal St George’s. Jordan Spieth, the Champion Golfer of 2017, applied the most significant pressure on a gripping final day and finished two strokes behind after matching Morikawa’s closing 66, while Louis Oosthuizen (71) and Jon Rahm (66) shared third on 11 under. Oosthuizen led after each of the first three rounds and was one clear of Morikawa heading into the last 18, but the South African – second in each of the previous two majors in 2021 - was unable to secure another Claret Jug 11 years on from his runaway triumph at St Andrews. A combination of calm conditions and a relatively lush, green links ensured there were plenty of birdie opportunities from the outset as Oosthuizen began his week with a six-under 64 in round one to lead Spieth and Brian Harman by a shot. The Champion of 2010 then doubled his advantage on Friday with a 65 – setting a new record aggregate of 129 for the first 36 holes of an Open – but the star of the second day was Morikawa, whose sublime 64 lifted him into second place, one ahead of Spieth. Day two also produced the undoubted shot of the Championship as Jonathan ‘Jigger’ Thomson – a survivor of leukaemia and the tallest player in European Tour history – brought the house down at the par-3 16th with a hole-in-one. Oosthuizen, Morikawa and Spieth were all tied at the top of the leaderboard as round three moved towards a conclusion, but it was the former who once again ended the day in front at 12 under, with Morikawa one back and Spieth three adrift after a costly bogey-bogey finish. After two more bogeys early in his final round however, Spieth threatened to pull off a sensational comeback as he picked up six shots in eight holes to charge firmly back into contention as Oosthuizen’s challenge faded. Yet Morikawa, who had three birdies of his own at the seventh, eighth and ninth, remained rock-solid and a crucial gain on the 14th gave the 23-year-old a two-shot cushion that he would not relinquish. Lowry put up an admirable defence of his crown as he tied for 12th, while the Silver Medal went to Matthias Schmid, who turned professional the next day after finishing four clear of Yuxin Lin, the only other amateur to make the cut. related The 149th Open Royal St George's The 149th Open / Story of the Championship The 149th Open Royal St George's Majestic Morikawa wins The 149th Open / Nerveless display lands Claret Jug for debutant The 149th Open Royal St George's Spieth proud of strong finish / Salutes ‘pretty special’ Morikawa Name Finish R1 R2 R3 R4 Total Par Collin MORIKAWA Champion Golfer 1 67 64 68 66 265 -15 Jordan SPIETH 2 65 67 69 66 267 -13 Jon RAHM T3 71 64 68 66 269 -11 Louis OOSTHUIZEN T3 64 65 69 71 269 -11 Dylan FRITTELLI 5 66 67 70 68 271 -9 Brooks KOEPKA T6 69 66 72 65 272 -8 Mackenzie HUGHES T6 66 69 68 69 272 -8 Dustin JOHNSON T8 68 65 73 67 273 -7 Robert MACINTYRE T8 72 69 65 67 273 -7 Daniel BERGER T8 70 67 68 68 273 -7 Scottie SCHEFFLER T8 67 66 69 71 273 -7 Viktor HOVLAND T12 68 71 69 66 274 -6 Emiliano GRILLO T12 70 64 72 68 274 -6 Shane LOWRY T12 71 65 69 69 274 -6 Tony FINAU T15 70 66 72 67 275 -5 Paul CASEY T15 68 67 70 70 275 -5 Marcel SIEM T15 67 67 70 71 275 -5 Corey CONNERS T15 68 68 66 73 275 -5 Sergio GARCIA T19 68 69 73 66 276 -4 Brandt SNEDEKER T19 68 68 72 68 276 -4 Brian HARMAN T19 65 71 71 69 276 -4 Aaron RAI T19 70 69 68 69 276 -4 Webb SIMPSON T19 66 72 67 71 276 -4 Kevin STREELMAN T19 70 69 66 71 276 -4 Justin HARDING T19 67 67 70 72 276 -4 Xander SCHAUFFELE T26 69 71 72 65 277 -3 Byeong Hun AN T26 67 70 73 67 277 -3 Ian POULTER T26 72 66 71 68 277 -3 Matthew FITZPATRICK T26 71 69 67 70 277 -3 Cameron TRINGALE T26 69 66 71 71 277 -3 Jason KOKRAK T26 70 70 66 71 277 -3 Andy SULLIVAN T26 67 67 71 72 277 -3 Bryson DECHAMBEAU T33 71 70 72 65 278 -2 Benjamin HEBERT T33 66 74 71 67 278 -2 Tommy FLEETWOOD T33 67 71 70 70 278 -2 Talor GOOCH T33 69 72 67 70 278 -2 Lanto Griffin T33 69 70 68 71 278 -2 Danny WILLETT T33 67 69 70 72 278 -2 Cameron SMITH T33 69 67 68 74 278 -2 JC Ritchie T40 71 70 72 66 279 -1 Justin THOMAS T40 72 67 71 69 279 -1 Max HOMA T40 70 69 71 69 279 -1 Daniel Van Tonder T40 68 66 74 71 279 -1 Dean BURMESTER T40 70 67 71 71 279 -1 Matt WALLACE T40 70 68 69 72 279 -1 Jazz JANEWATTANANOND T46 70 69 74 67 280 -
