Members Online • smalltownreddituser Is John Wick a member of the Creed? FanTheory So lately I've been replaying all the Assassin's Creed games, and in every game, they are throughout a vastly different time period and continent. This obviously implies that after the creation of the creed, its a worldwide organization. As you get closer and closer to modern day, the assassin's have newer weapons and tools. I just rewatched John Wick 1-3, and after watching the 2nd one, to kill the sister, it is in Italy, and she is a member of the High Table, and then the leader of the High Table is out in the desert, in what seems to be implied to be the middle east. This would make sense as Asia is much older than "America" in terms of civilization and religion how they are perceived today. I dont know if this has been thought of before, or if its even possibly true, but with such a huge secret underground world of assassins, it seems very likely that the High Table are the descendants of those who could have helped create the Creed, and in modern day the hidden blade isnt as realistic as it is in the game, so they just use whatever weapons they need, to get the job done. Has anybody else thought of this connection, or am I just looking too much into it lol? Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
