It is the home of the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) and the annual Fiesta Bowl . It replaced Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe as the home of the Cardinals, and is adjacent to Desert Diamond Arena , former home of the Arizona Coyotes of the National Hockey League . The stadium has been the host of the Fiesta Bowl since 2007 . It hosted two BCS National Championship games in 2007 and 2011 respectively. It hosted the College Football Playoff National Championship in 2016, three Super Bowls ( 2008 , 2015 , and 2023 ), as well as the Pro Bowl in 2015. It also hosted the final game of the 2025 NFL Wild Card weekend for the Los Angeles Rams against the Minnesota Vikings due to the Southern California Wildfires going on at the time. For soccer, it was one of the stadiums for the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup also the first semi-final of the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup , the Copa América Centenario in 2016 and the 2024 Copa América in 2024. For basketball, it hosted the NCAA Men's Final Four in 2017 and 2024 . The stadium opened in 2006 as Cardinals Stadium . Later that year in September, the University of Phoenix acquired naming rights , renaming it University of Phoenix Stadium , in what was then a 20-year agreement. It was renamed in September 2018 for insurance company State Farm , which has an 18-year naming rights deal. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] History [ edit ] Since moving to Arizona from St. Louis in 1988 , the Cardinals had played at Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University in Tempe . The Cardinals planned to play there for only a few years, until a new stadium could be built in Phoenix. The savings and loan crisis derailed funding for a new stadium during the 1990s. Over time, the Cardinals expressed frustration at being merely tenants in a college football stadium. The lack of having their own stadium denied them additional revenue streams available to other NFL teams. The Cardinals campaigned several times in the years prior to its construction for a new and more modern facility. In 2000 and 2001 as the Cardinals began exploring places to build their new stadium, numerous cities began to bid for it. The Arizona Tourism and Sports Authority oversaw construction of the stadium and were responsible for finding the stadium's location. Tempe and Avondale were front runners, with other sites in downtown Phoenix, the Fort McDowell Indian Reservation, and near Fountain Hills also being considered. The Tempe site would be close to the Cardinals’ training facility but would cost the authority $30,000 monthly in water expenses. The Avondale land would be a donation by developer John F. Long , who would also assume the risk for the $26 million infrastructure cost. [ 13 ] By 2002, Mesa and Glendale had also submitted bids and taken over as top choices. Ultimately, Mesa residents would vote to not approve the building of the stadium and Glendale was with its promised $36 million in infrastructure improvements and 11,000 parking spots near the stadium. [ 14 ] The ceremonial groundbreaking for the new stadium in 2003 was held on April 12, and after three years of construction, the 63,400-seat venue opened on August 1, 2006 . It was designed by Eisenman Architects and HOK Sport (now Populous ). [ 15 ] The stadium is considered an architectural icon for the region and was named by Business Week as one of the ten “most impressive” sports facilities on the globe due to the combination of its retractable roof (engineering design by Walter P Moore ) and roll-in natural grass field, [ 16 ] similar to the GelreDome and the Veltins-Arena . [ 17 ] LED video and ribbon displays from Daktronics in Brookings, South Dakota were installed in 2006 prior to Arizona's first game of the season at the new stadium. [ 18 ] The cost of the project was $455 million, which included $395.4 million for the stadium, $41.7 million for site improvements, and $17.8 million for the land. Contributors to the stadium included the Arizona Sports and Tourism Authority ($302.3 million), the Arizona Cardinals ($143.2 million), and the City of Glendale ($9.5 million). The playing field outside and lined for the Arizona Cardinals Stadium roof in 2007 The interior with field removed. To protect the stadium's grass playing surface and to provide a flat floor for solid footing, non- football events are always held with the facility in this configuration. The stadium has 88 luxury suites – called luxury lofts – with space for 16 future suites as the stadium matures. The 25 acres (10 ha) surrounding the stadium is called Sportsman's Park (the team had previously played in a venue of the same name in St. Louis from 1960 to 1965). Included within the Park is an 8-acre (3.2 ha) landscaped tailgating area called the Great Lawn. The approximate elevation at field level is 1,070 feet (330 m) above sea level . The stadium seating capacity can be expanded by 8,800 for "mega-events" such as college bowls, NFL Super Bowls, the NFC Championship Game, and the Final Four [ 19 ] by adding risers and ganged, portable "X-frame" folding seats. The end zone area on the side of the facility where the field tray rolls in and out of the facility can be expanded to accommodate an additional tier of seating which slopes down from the scoreboard level. The roof is made out of translucent Birdair fabric and opens in 12 minutes. It is the first retractable roof ever built on an incline. In 2024, the Cardinals announced renovations to add two luxury clubs to both endzones: Casitas Garden Club on the South end and Morgan Athletic Club on the North end. New tunnel seats and field seats will also be added. [ 20 ] Events [ edit ] Cardinals win NFC Championship, January 18, 2009 Events held at the stadium include Arizona Cardinals home games; public grand opening tours held August 19–20, 2006 (attended by 120,000 people); various shows, expositions, tradeshows and motor sport events; and international soccer exhibition matches.

The first regular season game was played September 10 against the San Francisco 49ers (the Cardinals won 34–27).

On October 16, 2006, the stadium hosted a notable game between the Cardinals and the undefeated Chicago Bears where the Bears came back from a 20-point deficit to defeat the Cardinals .

Including a road game against the Cardinals, the 49ers played four of their final five games at State Farm Stadium to end the season. Super Bowl LVII was held at the stadium on February 12, 2023. The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in a high-scoring affair, 38–35.
