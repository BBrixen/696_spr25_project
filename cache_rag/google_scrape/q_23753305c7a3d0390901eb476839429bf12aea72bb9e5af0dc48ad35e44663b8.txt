Our journalists weighed in with live analysis. APRIL 23, 2017 Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 12:02 PM ET Hello, everyone! We’re watching the results of today’s presidential election in France, the first of two rounds. A lot is at stake — not just for the 67 million people of France, but also for the European Union, the United States and NATO. Photo A Guide to the French Vote (and How It Relates to ‘Brexit’ and Trump) After recent electoral upheavals, including the victory of Donald J. Trump and the vote for “Brexit,” the world is waiting to see which way the French will lean. The New York Times This is an extraordinarily close and unpredictable contest. Of the 11 candidates, four were running neck-and-neck in the final polls. As many as 30 percent of voters entered the weekend undecided. Photo As the French Go to the Polls, Uncertainty Is the Only Sure Bet The presidential election on Sunday is one of the most consequential in recent times — not just for France, but for Europe — and one of the most unpredictable, too. The New York Times Over the next few hours, Times journalists across France and Europe will be participating in this chat and fielding questions from me and from our readers. Ask a question using the form below. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 12:06 PM ET I’d like to start with Alissa Rubin, our Paris bureau chief. As of 5 p.m. in France, 69.42 percent of voters had turned out — ever so slightly less than the 70.59 percent at the same point in the 2012 election. Is this significant? Alissa Rubin Paris bureau chief April 23, 12:08 PM ET Hi, this is Alissa J. Rubin. I’ve covered the Middle East, Afghanistan and the Balkans and am now Paris bureau chief. No, Sewell, I do not think it’s particularly significant – at least not yet. The pollsters and networks are predicting that the final abstention rate will be around 20 percent, and that would be about average or a little better than the last election, so I think we have to wait until 8 p.m. when the polls close. A lot of people vote late on Sunday, and it’s a beautiful day here, at least in Paris, and many people may be out enjoying the weather. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 12:09 PM ET Interesting! Alissa, you’ve been following this race for months. As we enter the final hours of voting, has anything struck you in this closing stretch? Anything striking in the candidates’ final arguments, or in what you’re hearing from voters? Alissa Rubin Paris bureau chief April 23, 12:16 PM ET The last few days were a real test for the candidates because they were confronted with an attack on the police on the Champs Elysées. One police officer, sadly, was killed, and two others were wounded. Responsibility was claimed by the Islamic State. So of course all of the candidates responded, and we could see how they might react in an emergency situation and what tone they might take. I was struck that the two who have been leading in the polls both seemed a bit off to me in their remarks. Photo Attack on Champs-Élysées Injects More Uncertainty Into French Vote The far-right leader Marine Le Pen seized on the brazen assault, but she was not the only presidential candidate who stood to gain ground before voting on Sunday. The New York Times Alissa Rubin Paris bureau chief April 23, 12:21 PM ET Emmanuel Macron stepped back and talked about how terrorism in France was the new normal and people had to get used to it, and Marine Le Pen, who is the far-right candidate, fanned division and spoke about putting everyone who has been marked as a Fiche S, which is a very vague designation, be brought to justice. Now, many people who are labeled as Fiche S, which means they’ve been noted by the security services for having some connection to terrorism or terrorist activity, have not actually done anything. Some just know people who have, so it’s a bit broad to say they should be tried or put in jail. Alissa Rubin Paris bureau chief April 23, 12:21 PM ET It is hard to know the right tone to strike, but I actually think that the much-maligned President François Hollande did a very good job on Thursday night and spoke feelingly about the police, but also reassured people. Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 12:24 PM ET Steven Erlanger here, bureau chief in London, formerly Paris. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 12:24 PM ET Steve, you covered the last French election for us, in 2012. Hollande Ousts Sarkozy in French Presidential Election François Hollande became the first Socialist president of France since 1981, but his victory over Nicolas Sarkozy will also be seen as a challenge to the policy of austerity in the euro zone. The New York Times Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 12:24 PM ET From your perch in London, what do you make of this year’s contest? Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 12:25 PM ET The main takeaway for me is anxiety, and the implosion of the two main parties — the Socialists, since Hollande didn’t even dare to run again, and the center-right, now called the Republicans, with the scandals around François Fillon. Photo Fillon Scandal Indicts, Foremost, France’s Political Elite The presidential candidate François Fillon is in deep trouble over payments to his wife and children. But there is a long history of such cozy arrangements. The New York Times Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 12:26 PM ET Those implosions created disgust and anger and space for “new” candidates of the center, like Emmanuel Macron, and old candidates of the extremes, like Marine Le Pen and Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 12:26 PM ET And the other fascination, for me, at least, is the way that working-class voters seem more concerned with immigration than with capitalism … Alissa Rubin Paris bureau chief April 23, 12:26 PM ET I agree, Steve, and it will be especially interesting to see if the French come back to Fillon and send him to the second round despite the embezzlement allegations. There is much more tolerance for certain kinds of corruption here. After all, Alain Juppé, who competed with Fillon for the nomination, also had financial malfeasance in his past. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 12:27 PM ET Speaking of corruption, I’ve been struck at how many candidates have been tarnished by ethics questions. Photo Fillon Scandal Indicts, Foremost, France’s Political Elite The presidential candidate François Fillon is in deep trouble over payments to his wife and children. But there is a long history of such cozy arrangements. The New York Times Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 12:27 PM ET Fillon may benefit from the security scare — he wrote a whole book on supposed Islamist radicalism before the election, and he’s a presidential-looking Catholic from deep France. Alissa Rubin Paris bureau chief April 23, 12:28 PM ET That’s right, and the fact that he “looks presidential” is something that lots of people have commented on. He also was quite strategic in the debates and avoided holding forth excessively, and that made him seem a bit more like the adult in the room, although critics said he seemed to be taking a back seat to the others. So I guess  you can read it both ways. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 12:28 PM ET Of the four leading candidates, Fillon is the only one from a mainstream party! That’s pretty remarkable. Benoît Morenne Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 12:32 PM ET Hi, all, Benoît Morenne here, reporter at The Times’s Paris bureau. One thing I’ve found striking in the days leading to the election is that Fillon voters seemed unabashed, despite the financial scandals that tainted his campaign. Alissa Rubin Paris bureau chief April 23, 12:32 PM ET I know I’m sounding like I’m agreeing a lot, but I think in terms of France’s internal politics, both you and Steve are right: The Socialists, who for so many years have shared a dominant position in France with the mainstream right party, appear to have lost their strength. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 12:32 PM ET Our reporters in Paris have been talking to voters all day. What is everyone hearing? Benoît Morenne Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 12:33 PM ET This morning I talked to voters in Fontainebleau, a midsize town in the southeast of Paris, where people massively voted for Fillon in the center-right primaries. When it comes to allegations of corruption, their argument often was that “everyone does it.” One elderly voter — a large share of Fillon voters are over 60 — told me that at least Fillon had stopped hiring members of his family long before other politicians. Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 12:36 PM ET Hi, everybody, Aurelien Breeden here, also a reporter at the Times bureau in Paris. Going back to what Benoît was saying, I heard similar arguments in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, where I spoke to a couple of Fillon supporters in the district. They even praised him for “weathering the storm” of the embezzlement allegations, as they put it. Benoît Morenne Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 12:40 PM ET Another observation I’d make: More people than I expected told me they would vote for Benoît Hamon, who pulled an upset in the left parties’ primaries but sank in polls afterwards, mostly because of a mediocre campaign. Polls predicted that he would not attract more than 7 percent of votes. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 12:40 PM ET Did the Fillon voters you all spoke to say they felt he had been unfairly picked on? (Similar to how many Trump voters have tuned out criticism of him?) Paméla Rougerie Intern, Paris bureau April 23, 12:40 PM ET Hi, everyone, Paméla Rougerie here. I’m an intern for the Paris bureau. I talked this morning with voters from the 12th arrondissement of Paris, a district in the east of the city. It is usually a left-leaning area, and most voters I talked to told me that they usually voted for the Socialist Party. But today, most of them were torn between voting from the heart — which to them meant voting for Benoît Hamon, the Socialist Party candidate — and voting more strategically, meaning that they might vote for Emmanuel Macron, who could actually beat Marine Le Pen if both of them make it to the second round. Elian Peltier Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 12:41 PM ET Hi, everyone, Elian Peltier, also a reporter here in Paris. Coming back to what Aurelien and Benoît said, a retired woman told me this morning in Versailles that “France needs a man to govern, not a saint,” referring to Fillon. Most of the right-wing voters I’ve interviewed were very pragmatic about their choice: “He’s not the best, but he’s definitely not the worse,” another retired man told me in Versailles. Benoît Morenne Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 12:42 PM ET Sewell, a LOT of Fillon supporters have denounced a “conspiracy” against the candidate, run both by the media and the judges. It’s important to keep in mind that to most right-wing voters this election was theirs, and a lot of them feel like it’s been stolen from them. Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 12:43 PM ET Yes, as Benoît has just pointed out, until the embezzlement scandal broke in January, Fillon was the front-runner, almost a shoo-in to the Élysée. So the feeling that the election is being stolen from them is very strong. Elian Peltier Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 12:44 PM ET Sewell, to follow up on what Benoît said, I would add that a lot of them have also blamed Fillon’s communication. “I thought about better ways of denying allegations than he did!” a lady told me this morning in Versailles as she was about to vote for Fillon. Max Fisher Writer, The Interpreter April 23, 12:45 PM ET Some interesting context to Fillon supporters’ shrugging off the corruption scandals is that France has always been sort of an outlier in terms of corruption, particularly political corruption. It’s not at crazy levels or anything, but it’s much higher than in other developed economies. So there’s more of a norm around tolerating it. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 12:48 PM ET Steve, in recent weeks, two of the four leading candidates seemed to be leading the polls: Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate, who also ran in 2012, and Emmanuel Macron, an independent candidate who says he’s “neither left nor right.” Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 12:51 PM ET What happened to the mainstream parties? Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 12:52 PM ET Bernard-Henri Lévy called the Socialist Party dead a decade ago, but François Hollande just beat Nicolas Sarkozy, who was hated, in 2012. But it is a conservative party and has shown little boldness in dealing with France’s main structural problems, like youth unemployment. Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 12:53 PM ET And on the center-right, the “party” has traditionally been a movement around a candidate — Chirac, Sarkozy, Fillon — and keeps changing its name. The Fillon scandal was a big blow to a man considered solid, decent and dull. Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 12:55 PM ET And Fillon also troubles some on the center-right with his closeness to Vladimir Putin and the Russians, which goes beyond traditional Gaullism …. Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 12:55 PM ET But it should be said that mainstream parties all over continental Europe have been eroding, some faster, some more slowly — especially the big center-right “Christian Democratic” parties as in Germany and Italy, too. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 12:56 PM ET Max wrote about the Fillon-Putin relationship here: Photo French Election Hints at a European Shift Toward Russia François Fillon’s victory in a presidential primary suggests that a shift from confrontation to accommodation of Moscow has already begun in the region. The New York Times Max Fisher Writer, The Interpreter April 23, 12:56 PM ET An honest-to-god bromance! Max Fisher Writer, The Interpreter April 23, 12:57 PM ET Steve, that’s a good point about the broader collapse of establishment parties. And it’s a lesson worth remembering, regardless of how the vote turns out. We could end up with a pretty mainstream/centrist Macron, but the establishment has still been shown as weakened, and that’ll matter after the vote. Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 12:59 PM ET And Macron has fashioned himself as “the establishment’s anti-establishment candidate,” as Alissa put it in her recent profile of him. If he is elected, I don’t know how well that will hold up after five years of actual governing. Photo Macron Wants to Change France. But Will Voters Elect an Unknown? Emmanuel Macron has no political party to speak of and has never held elected office, but he is one of the front-runners in Sunday’s election. The New York Times Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 1:00 PM ET For everyone catching up: Polls are about to start closing in the first of two rounds of France’s presidential election — a pivotal moment for Europe. To catch up on what to watch for, click here: Photo The French Election: What to Watch For Voters have to choose from 11 candidates, with the four leading ones so close in the polls that it is too risky to predict the outcome. The New York Times Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 1:00 PM ET I agree, Max. However this election turns out, it means change. And Fillon and Le Pen are the only ones of the supposedly leading quartet who lead what passes for a party! French presidents are powerful, but they need legislative support …. Max Fisher Writer, The Interpreter April 23, 1:01 PM ET Ha, when Le Pen is the closest thing to an establishment leader … Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 1:01 PM ET Aurelien makes an important point, too. If he wins, Macron will need to cobble together legislative candidates tout de suite if he’s going to be able to run France, let alone change it. Paméla Rougerie Intern, Paris bureau April 23, 1:03 PM ET Lots of voters are using the “He’s not the best, but he’s not the worst” argument for Emmanuel Macron. I’ve heard this at least three times this morning in the 12th arrondissement. Benoît Morenne Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:04 PM ET Paméla, I think you’re right to talk about that inner conflict for the left voters. In a very volatile election, what set hard-leftist Mélenchon, socially liberal, environmentally friendly Benoît Hamon and pro-business, pro-Europe Macron apart in their minds? Foreign policy and Europe, it seems. Voters told me they could not choose Mélenchon because of his lenient attitude towards Putin, and his anti-E.U. stance. Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:04 PM ET This is a common feature of French presidential elections — hand-wringing among leftist parties and voters about whether or not to unite around a common candidate for the first round. A Mélenchon voter told me this morning that he had hoped for a Hamon-Mélenchon alliance, to no avail. Lilia Blaise Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:05 PM ET Coming back from the Paris suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, a lot of of the young people are voting for Mélenchon there, because he make them feel equal to other French people and less stigmatized. Benoît Morenne Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:05 PM ET In terms of Macron voters, one question hanging is whether his reach will go beyond large cities, where a large share of his electorate lives. I came across a few Macron voters this week in the provinces, but not that many, really. In Louviers, a town that voted like the rest of France in the three last presidential elections, out of 12 voters, none cited Macron as their candidate. Le Pen, Mélenchon and Fillon were the most mentioned. Photo As the French Go to the Polls, Uncertainty Is the Only Sure Bet The presidential election on Sunday is one of the most consequential in recent times — not just for France, but for Europe — and one of the most unpredictable, too. The New York Times Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 1:10 PM ET Yes. Anti-“system” candidates — Le Pen, Mélenchon, Macron — have had a huge influence on this race. Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 1:10 PM ET Carnegie Europe recently asked some “experts” if France needed to change. All agreed that it did, in different ways. I made a short contribution focusing on structural economic problems. Elian Peltier Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:12 PM ET Steve, I would add that the National Front voters are also afraid of this ability or inability for Marine Le Pen to govern if elected president. I was out speaking with voters in the northern town of Hénin-Beaumont today. Sylvie, a 50-year-old National Front voter there, said to me, “Marine Le Pen is great, but what about people around her? We’ll never have enough members of Parliament to run the country.” Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 1:12 PM ET Right, Elian. If the French political parties don’t gang up on her sufficiently to stop her becoming president, they’ll almost surely do that in the legislature. Benoît Morenne Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:12 PM ET I think Elian is making a good point. Even more, some National Front voters don’t actually believe Le Pen can be elected. But “it sends a strong signal,” Dominique, a police officer, told me this morning on his way to the polling station. Max Fisher Writer, The Interpreter April 23, 1:13 PM ET I actually feel like I don’t have an amazing sense for how much of a role the French legislature can and does play in limiting the president, compared to other presidential systems. Can it get as combative as in, say, the U.S. of A.? Alissa Rubin Paris bureau chief April 23, 1:14 PM ET Hi, Max. In answer to your very good question about the president’s power versus that of the National Assembly, the president does not have veto power in France that is analogous to that of the American president. However, if he or she does not like a piece of legislation, it can be sent back for a second vote. But if the Parliament passes it a second time, it becomes law. Alissa Rubin Paris bureau chief April 23, 1:14 PM ET In contrast, the president does have the power to force through legislation without a vote, but there are limitations to how often he or she can use that power. It was used to force through modifications in the labor law this year, but then could not be used for any other legislation that year. Lilia Blaise Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:17 PM ET Hi, Lilia Blaise here, reporting in the Paris bureau on the French elections. For the suburbs like Aulnay-sous-Bois, where I’m talking to voters, the youth mostly went for Mélenchon because he is the most involved in social issues and make them feel integrated and not stigmatized as some young people told me. Lilia Blaise Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:19 PM ET Mélenchon is also sending an appealing message to Muslim voters because he does not target them, as one woman told me in the suburbs. Lilia Blaise Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:19 PM ET The vote in Aulnay-sous-Bois was important for some young people there because of what happened to Théo, a young black man who said he was raped by the police in February. It stirred up riots in the suburbs against the police. (An investigation is still underway as to whether he was raped.) Photo Fury Rises in France Over Accusations Police Beat and Raped a Black Man Youths set cars and trash bins ablaze and vandalized buildings in suburbs around Paris, venting rage for the fourth straight day over the allegations. The New York Times Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 1:23 PM ET We’re going to take a couple of readers’ questions now. From a Reader What French president would be the better choice for a good relationship with Trump’s government? And what would be the worst, among the four main candidates? Hans France April 23,  1:26 PM ET Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:26 PM ET Hans, Mélenchon is very critical of the United States and its foreign policy, so that would probably be Trump’s worst option. Macron would be more like François Hollande (the current president): The U.S is seen as a key ally, but no love for Trump. Lilia Blaise Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:27 PM ET Probably not Macron, since he got a phone call from Barack Obama just a couple of days before the election, but maybe his ambition and his experience in the economy would be a good thing to bond with Trump. Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:27 PM ET Fillon and Le Pen would probably have the warmest relations with Trump, but even in those cases there are important caveats. Le Pen was delighted by his election because she hopes to ride the same wave of discontent that he did, but she has distanced herself from some of his more recent choices — like the airstrike in Syria. Max Fisher Writer, The Interpreter April 23, 1:28 PM ET Something I’d add from Washington is that a lesson foreign governments keep learning is that Trump’s government is bigger and more complicated than just his personal Twitter account. So there’s definitely ideological affinity, and something like overt support, between him and Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate. But foreign policy is complicated! Le Pen wants to change the status quo in Europe, and that would have big ramifications for American interests, especially trade and security. Who knows how that could play out. Turmoil begets turmoil. Macron in the status quo candidate, and that hasn’t personally endeared him to Trump, but status quo is a lot easier to manage. Just look at his relationship with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany: Trump has sure criticized her a bunch, but it’s basically settled into being fine. From a Reader Je connais des douzaines d'étudiants français ici à Montréal qui votent Mélenchon. Les votes à l'étranger pourraient-ils décider l'élection? Thomas MacDonald Montréal, QC April 23,  1:30 PM ET Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 1:34 PM ET (For those who don’t read French: Thomas is asking if the votes of French citizens who reside overseas could decide the outcome of this election.) Hannah Olivennes Digital editor, London April 23, 1:36 PM ET Hi, I’m Hannah Olivennes. I’m half-French, half-British, and a digital editor in the London newsroom. Yes, there are hundreds of thousands of French people in the U.K. I was at the Wembley polling station in northwestern London this morning, and there was a line around the block. People were told the waiting time would be around 2 hours. And that was just half an hour after the polling station opened! People were frustrated, but determined to vote. Alissa Rubin Paris bureau chief April 23, 1:37 PM ET Hi, Thomas. I think it will be hard to tell if the overseas voters will make a critical difference, but if the election is as close as has been predicted in the polls, it seems their votes could even shift the outcome. Also, my understanding is that they do not always vote heavily, but today I read reports from Agence France-Presse, and it seemed that French voters overseas had turned out heavily both in the territories, and also in places like London, New York and Montreal, where many French citizens are working. Alissa Rubin Paris bureau chief April 23, 1:39 PM ET Thomas, just to amplify my answer to your question: There are both the voters in the French territories, such as French Polynesia and Mayotte, and then there are those French who are working overseas, like my colleague Hannah. In a close vote, I think they could make a difference. From a Reader Quel intérêt les citoyens américains portent-ils vraiment à cette élection française? Mathieu France April 23,  1:39 PM ET Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 1:39 PM ET Mathieu asks: “How interested, really, are American citizens in this election?” Max Fisher Writer, The Interpreter April 23, 1:39 PM ET I think Americans get that this election is really important for the world. Max Fisher Writer, The Interpreter April 23, 1:39 PM ET The stakes are very clear. Max Fisher Writer, The Interpreter April 23, 1:43 PM ET Also: Americans love election drama, for some reason I have never understood. Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:43 PM ET Are people in the States generally aware of the two-round system, though? Polling in the first round can be misleading, because the front-runner in the first round doesn’t necessarily win. For instance, Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate, has been a front-runner for months, but few predict that she will win in the runoff. From a Reader Are the young people supporting Le Pen turning out? Robert P France April 23,  1:44 PM ET Lilia Blaise Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:47 PM ET Hi, Robert P. I met a 20-year-old student in Aulnay-sous-Bois who told me he fully supported Le Pen because he was tired of the terrorist attacks and he believed they were directly linked to immigration. Elian Peltier Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:49 PM ET I have been in Hénin-Beaumont this afternoon, a National Front stronghold where Le Pen is supposed to speak tonight. For the record, she won 35 percent of the votes here in 2012. Most of the National Front voters I interviewed were very hopeful for this first round, but much more skeptical about the second round — if Le Pen makes it. All of them (a dozen people) said they would cast a blank vote in the second round if Le Pen is eliminated tonight. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 1:54 PM ET For readers just joining us: Our journalists are answering readers’ questions about the French election. Polls will finish closing just a few minutes from now. Here’s what to watch for: Photo The French Election: What to Watch For Voters have to choose from 11 candidates, with the four leading ones so close in the polls that it is too risky to predict the outcome. The New York Times From a Reader Assuming that Le Pen makes it through the first round, how do she and the National Front, as the far right-party, get beyond the ceiling of her own constituency? Reuben Washington, DC April 23,  1:54 PM ET Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 1:54 PM ET Reuben raises a question I’ve wanted to ask. In the 2002 election, Marine Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, squeaked into the presidential runoff, and both the left and the right in France came together to elect Jacques Chirac, a center-right candidate, by fairly overwhelming numbers. Might we see a repeat of that precedent this year? Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 1:56 PM ET That’s a good question, Sewell. I would say yes and no.  No, because Marine Le Pen does not have the same repulsion effect that her father did – people across the political spectrum overwhelmingly voted for Chirac in the second round back in 2002. This time around, voters on the mainstream right are more likely to shift votes and vote for the far right then they were in the past. Yes, because the mainstream left and right parties are still able to mobilize voters to prevent the National Front from winning, like they did in the last regional elections. For many French voters, a National Front presidency is still unpalatable. Max Fisher Writer, The Interpreter April 23, 1:57 PM ET She will not necessarily gain enough votes to win in the second round, but there’s pretty good evidence that Le Pen has broken through that ceiling and is appealing well beyond her usual base. Max Fisher Writer, The Interpreter April 23, 1:59 PM ET She’s done this with something called “moral license” — she argues that her policies targeting Muslims or migrants are actually about protecting other groups, such as women, LGBT voters, even Jews. (Which is pretty wild given her party’s history of anti-Semitism.) This lets voters give themselves permission to vote for otherwise taboo ideas and feel okay about it. Max Fisher Writer, The Interpreter April 23, 2:01 PM ET There’s a ton of fascinating social science backing up how this works — it’s really effective at getting people to accept once-forbidden ideas! Photo France’s Far Right, Once Known for Anti-Semitism, Courts Jews The National Front is recasting itself as a defender of Jews — which could give voters license to embrace its anti-immigrant views. The New York Times Lilia Blaise Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:01 PM ET Hi, Reuben. Actually, Marine Le Pen could draw Fillon voters because some proposals in their programs are similar, and it will be difficult for Fillon voters to vote for the left. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 2:07 PM ET Just in: Preliminary results have just started to come in, and they suggest that Emmanuel Macron, the independent centrist candidate, and Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate, are leading the pack and will make it into the runoff. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 2:08 PM ET To be clear, this is an early estimation, and things could change. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 2:09 PM ET Aurelien, can you explain what these first numbers mean, exactly? Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:10 PM ET Yes, Sewell. Pollsters use vote counts from a selected number of constituencies that closed at 7, and extrapolate nationwide. But in the bigger cities, polls closed at 8, so all the results are not in yet. Benoît Morenne Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:10 PM ET Macron supporters are hugging here at the candidate’s electoral party in Porte de Versailles. Supporters are singing La Marseillaise, waving flags. It’s hard to describe how electric the atmosphere is here. Elian Peltier Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:16 PM ET Here in Hénin-Beaumont, where Le Pen is expected to speak soon, people erupted in cheers when the results appeared on the screens. “We are in the final!” people chanted, like after a soccer game. Julien Favier, a 20-year-old National Front voter, had tears in his eyes. “We’ve always voted for the FN in my family,” he said. “Tonight is our night.” Elian Peltier Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:16 PM ET FrenchElection ���� here in Hénin Beaumont the National Front voters reacted to the results like after a soccer game https://t.co/wOl3koSzZS — Elian Peltier on Twitter ( elianpeltier ) Elian Peltier Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:17 PM ET Steve Briois, the National Front mayor here who is known to Le Pen, called it a “historic victory.” He said he was relieved about the results and expects significant parts of Fillon’s voters to support the National Front in the runoff. Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:18 PM ET Benoît Hamon, the Socialist candidate who dropped to single digits in the polls, is already giving his concession speech. He is acknowledging that he “failed” to prevent “disaster that was heralded.” Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:18 PM ET He is calling to “beat the National Front” by voting for Emmanuel Macron. Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:19 PM ET “I make a clear distinction between a political adversary and an enemy of the Republic,” he just said — referring to Macron first and Le Pen second. Elian Peltier Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:20 PM ET Some voters here at Le Pen’s campaign event are also praising the fact that a woman is in the second round. Julien Favier, the 20-year-old voter who had tears in his eyes a few minutes ago, said the need for a woman as president was “urgent.” Virginie Milczynski, 31, a National Front city council member of a nearby town, said she was so happy that someone who she said was “humble, close to the people” could make it to the second round. “It’s going to be tough to win the presidency, though. Everyone is going to be against us.” Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:20 PM ET Even though these are still preliminary results, they are pretty much what the polls had predicted: a close race, with Macron and Le Pen pulling ahead. There still seems to be uncertainty about who, between Fillon or Mélenchon, is in third place. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 2:23 PM ET For folks just tuning in: Emmanuel Macron, an independent and former economy minister who has never run for elected office before, and Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, are leading, according to preliminary results. François Fillon, of the center-right Republicans, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the far-left candidate, are vying for third place. If Macron and Le Pen make it into the runoff — as looks increasingly likely — it will be the first time in the history of the Fifth Republic that NO candidate from mainstream parties will be in the runoff. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 2:24 PM ET The economy, of course, has been a big issue in this election — Liz Alderman, our chief European business correspondent in Europe, has been monitoring the candidates’ economic platforms. Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 2:25 PM ET Hi, Liz Alderman here. I’m the European business correspondent based in Paris. I’ve covered the French and European economies and the fallout of the euro crisis in Greece and around Europe. Elian makes a good point about some people trusting Le Pen to bring back jobs — especially in blue-collar regions that have been hit by deindustrialization and globalization. The flagging economy, high unemployment and rising inequality have been huge issues in this election. Le Pen’s promises to impose “intelligent protectionism” and possibly pull back from the E.U. strike major chords with folks who feel they’ve lost out. Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 2:26 PM ET While Le Pen has appealed to working-class profiles, Macron has gotten a huge lift from voters who think he’s right that France needs to stay with the E.U. and would be stronger in Europe than outside. Macron voters I spoke with today in central Paris also said he, more than other candidates, would enhance French competitiveness through overhauls of the labor law, move the economy forward and help chip away at the stubbornly high unemployment rate, which has been stuck around 10 percent for over five years. Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 2:27 PM ET I’m Alison Smale. I’ve covered European politics West and East since before the Berlin Wall fell and am now bureau chief in that great city. Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 2:27 PM ET If this predicted outcome holds, a huge sigh of relief will course through Germany, the most important partner for France in the European Union. Chancellor Angela Merkel will probably hold off until tomorrow. She is in Hanover, where the world’s biggest industrial fair opened tonight with Germany’s other important neighbor, Poland, as guest this year. Paméla Rougerie Intern, Paris bureau April 23, 2:29 PM ET I am in Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s headquarters. He’s a far-left candidate from the “Unsubmissive France” party and is now around 19 percent in the latest poll numbers. The atmosphere here is pretty heavy. People are really disappointed. I talked to Patrice Finel, who has known Mr. Mélenchon for 40 years. He says that if the Le Pen-Macron scenario is confirmed, he won’t even show up to the polling station in the next round. “Why would I choose between the brown plague or the liberal cholera?” he asked, referring to Le Pen and Macron. Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 2:31 PM ET I have been the Berlin bureau chief since 2013, and I think it is safe to say that this election was watched even more closely than earlier ballots in bankrupt Greece, worrying Turkey and even the big American partner … Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 2:32 PM ET As Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s influential pro-Europe finance minister, said beforehand: “France is at least as important to Germany as Germany to France.” They are linchpins of any European unity. Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 2:32 PM ET Alison, I would imagine Berlin would breathe a sigh of relief so long as Macron stays ahead. Le Pen wants a “Frexit,” and has pledged a referendum on taking France out of the European Union. She’s also talked about ditching the euro and restoring a national currency. Macron says that would be a total disaster and France can only be strong if it stays with Europe. Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 2:33 PM ET Liz, you are right of course about Le Pen’s effect in Paris. But Macron ahead is what Berlin hoped for. Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 2:33 PM ET This is Steven Erlanger, back again from the French ambassador’s residence in London. Diplomatic neutrality, but sighs of relief too among guests. Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 2:34 PM ET But worries too about some Mélenchon and Fillon voters going to Le Pen and how Macron will govern without a party if he wins. Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 2:34 PM ET Macron is also seen as very pro-E.U. and tougher for Britain in “Brexit” negotiations. Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 2:34 PM ET Well, Steve, the Germans — and others — will always worry. But even though no one will say so openly, Germans would consider a Le Pen victory over all a catastrophe. Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 2:35 PM ET Steve, those are valid concerns. If Macron wins, he may struggle to get some of his toughest-sounding reforms, especially overhauling labor laws to create jobs, through Parliament. Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 2:35 PM ET If Macron does win, though, there is probably room for imaginative thinking about how France — and Europe — are run. Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 2:35 PM ET I imagine any current E.U. government would be relieved tonight if Macron wins. Moscow won’t be overjoyed, however. Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 2:36 PM ET Indeed, Steve, the Kremlin probably hoped for a different outcome. As I said, room for a lot of creative thinking … Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 2:39 PM ET Having just spent the weekend at the congress of the Alternative for Germany, the party most closely aligned with Le Pen, I think this outcome may dent the populist rise in Europe. Although Le Pen is strong … Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 2:39 PM ET Some analysts are already cutting Le Pen’s chances of winning to around 35 percent.  A major reason is her stance on pulling away from the E.U. and effectively leaving the euro. Although people blame the euro for hitting the economy in various ways, around three-quarters of the French still want to stay with it. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 2:44 PM ET Liz, a 35 percent chance of winning is more or less what some analysts gave Trump before the Nov. 8 election in the United States! Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:44 PM ET Fillon has started his concession speech, saying that he failed to “convince” the French. “The obstacles put on my path were too numerous, too cruel,” he says. Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 2:45 PM ET German and French intellectuals duked it out in Die Zeit and Le Monde this week about what Le Pen’s strength could mean. Several discovered the most unlikely French friends ready to vote for her: a gay man in Paris, a rich lawyer, a university student, etc. Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:45 PM ET Fillon — who has no love for Macron — says that “extremism can only bring about the misfortune and division of France” and says he will vote for Macron against Le Pen. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 2:46 PM ET We’re starting to see responses on Twitter from across the spectrum — and signs that the political establishment is consolidating its support around Macron. Former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who lost the Socialist runoff to Benoît Hamon, has thrown his support to Macron. Comme au 1er tour je voterai @EmmanuelMacron le 7 mai.Chacun doit mesurer la gravité du moment et tout faire pour rassembler.Pour la France. — Manuel Valls on Twitter ( manuelvalls ) Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 2:47 PM ET Right, Sewell! But things may swing more solidly Macron’s way with Fillon backing him. He said Le Pen would create intolerance and lead France to bankruptcy and chaos if France were to withdraw from Europe and the euro. Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:47 PM ET So far, both Hamon and Fillon have conceded. Mélenchon has not. His supporters have been on French TV saying it is still too close to call. Paméla Rougerie Intern, Paris bureau April 23, 2:49 PM ET I’ve spoken to Camille Barré, another Mélenchon supporter here in his headquarters. She says she won’t vote in the second round. “But I’m still hanging around,” she said. “I’m motivated, and I’m going to keep fighting for my cause in my personal and professional circles.” Benoît Morenne Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:50 PM ET Here’s my video of the results announced at Macron’s rally: Here’s a video of the results from #Macron’s electoral party https://t.co/FTwmSIrNZO — Benoît Morenne on Twitter ( benmorenne ) Benoît Morenne Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:52 PM ET “I was scared until the very end,” Nicolas Vian, a 45-year-old consultant and Macron supporter, just told me at the leading candidate’s rally. “It’s so new, I think a truly different political model is to come,” he said. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 2:52 PM ET For readers just joining us: Emmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old centrist independent, and Marine Le Pen, 48, the leader of the far-right National Front, are poised to compete in a May 7 runoff for the French presidency. It would be the first time in modern history that no one from the big mainstream parties has made it into the runoff. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 2:52 PM ET Macron, a former investment banker and former economy minister who portrays himself as “neither left nor right,” is poised to be the standard-bearer for the French establishment. He’s pro-European Union, and has taken a moderate line on hot-button issues like migration and terrorism. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 2:53 PM ET For Le Pen — who also ran for president in 2012 — this is also a big night. Her message that a declining France is losing its identity — and that French civilization itself is under threat because of immigration and, especially, Islam — has resonated with voters.   Early results suggest that she came just behind Macron. Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 2:54 PM ET The National Front, of course, would argue that it IS the mainstream, due to its success in local and national elections over the past few years. But many in French politics — voters and politicians — don’t see it that way, and point to the more controversial personalities who still operate in the party’s midst. My colleague Adam Nossiter recently wrote about this: Photo Le Pen’s Inner Circle Fuels Doubt About Bid to ‘Un-Demonize’ Her Party Two of the French candidate’s associates have longtime links to Nazi sympathizers and have been central to the National Front’s campaign finance scandals. The New York Times Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 2:54 PM ET Sewell, Liz, all — what will we be looking at in the next two weeks before the second round? Anything special Le Pen could do to endear herself with the establishment? Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 2:55 PM ET Sewell, interestingly, some people leaning toward Macron said they might switch their vote to Fillon after last week’s attack at the Champs Elysées. That didn’t come through today, and folks I spoke with said they thought he would lead authoritatively if more attacks do happen. Clearly, however, Le Pen has taken a much harder line on this. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 2:57 PM ET Just in, from Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve — an endorsement of Macron. The clearest sign yet that the establishment is rallying around Macron: J'appelle tous les républicains à se rassembler et à voter pour @EmmanuelMacron — Bernard Cazeneuve on Twitter ( bcazeneuve ) Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 3:00 PM ET I’m struck that Macron and Le Pen — combined — appear to have received around 45 percent of the vote. That means a majority of the French electorate is up for grabs in the May 7 runoff election. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 3:00 PM ET What messages will Macron and Le Pen be using to woo these voters over the next two weeks? Will they pivot, double down or do something else? Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 3:00 PM ET Alison, I don’t think Le Pen will aim for the establishment. More likely, she’ll try to capture more votes from people who remain worried about terrorism and who dislike Macron’s pro-globalization stance. Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 3:01 PM ET That’s what I think, too, though she needs at least part of the elite if she is ever to get the presidency. Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 3:01 PM ET Definitely, though with Fillon and Cazeneuve calling on folks to vote Macron, that may swing things. Still, we need to see what Mélenchon tells his base. Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 3:05 PM ET What will be interesting is how everyone adjusts to the new reality — the Socialist in the single digits? How much stronger is Marine Le Pen now than her father was in 2002? What new plans will emerge? Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 3:08 PM ET Hamon, trying to explain his disappointing fifth-place finish to fellow Socialists, said: “I know you are waiting for a rebirth. Tonight it is painful. Tomorrow it will be fruitful. I do not promise it to you; I am asking it of you.” In his concession speech, however, he threw his support behind Macron, a former Socialist who is now an independent. Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 3:08 PM ET Marine Le Pen has started speaking. She starts by thanking her supporters. “This result is historic,” she says. Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 3:09 PM ET Le Pen says the biggest issue of this election is “untamed globalization” that is threatening France and its culture. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 3:11 PM ET For readers just joining us: A consensus seems to be emerging that Le Pen — although she made it into the runoff — did not do quite as well as she would have hoped. She appears to have done slightly worse than Macron. Paméla Rougerie Intern, Paris bureau April 23, 3:13 PM ET While listening to Le Pen speak, Mélenchon supporters are singing, “We are here, we are France Unbowed,” the name of Mélenchon’s party, and “Resistance, resistance.” Some others are starting the first couplets of “L'Internationale,” the Socialist anthem. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 3:13 PM ET The Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consultancy, just put out this analysis: “We think Le Pen’s disappointing performance and today’s high turnout decrease the chances of her winning the Presidency; we now reduce her odds of winning to 35% (from 40% previously). Still, the next two weeks will be challenging for Macron, and the behavior of the right and far-left will be critical if he is to become France’s next president.” Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 3:14 PM ET Le Pen says she is the only candidate who can “get France on its feet again,” and the crowd follows by bursting into singing “La Marseillaise.” Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 3:15 PM ET Le Pen does not mention Macron by name but calls him the “heir” of the very unpopular sitting president, François Hollande, a Socialist. She says it is “time to free the French people” of the “arrogant elites” who want to dictate to them. Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 3:15 PM ET Based on Le Pen’s speech just now, she’s going to be hammering home themes of protectionism against terrorism and mass immigration, as well as against the forces of globalization. She’s appealing especially to blue-collar voters and people who feel that Macron’s vision of a more open France has led to greater inequality. Elian Peltier Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 3:16 PM ET Here in Hénin-Beaumont, a lot of voters came here with their families and their children - #FrenchElection ���� — Elian Peltier on Twitter ( elianpeltier ) Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 3:17 PM ET Mélenchon is still saying it is too close to call. He posted 15 minutes ago on Facebook that “the results from large cities are not yet known,” and he said commentators and analysts should be “prudent.” Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 3:20 PM ET In his statement, Bernard Cazeneuve, the sitting Socialist prime minister, urged French citizens to vote for Macron, “to beat the National Front and to thwart its dire project of regression for France and division of the French.” He called Le Pen’s agenda “dangerous and sectarian” and said that it would “impoverish, isolate and divide” the country. He added: “It will inevitably lead to the end of Europe and of the euro and, eventually, to France’s relegation. The National Front cannot be the future of our country.” Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 3:21 PM ET Question now really is if Macron can actively win support as his own man, and not just an anti-Le Pen. That was a mistake in 2002 and ushered in the standstill we have seen since. Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 3:21 PM ET Plus, Marine really reached out in all directions with her speech — to traditionalists who backed Fillon, to globalization haters who backed Mélenchon. Let’s see how far she gets … From a Reader Could Le Pen’s gender and mild attempts at moderation, combined with the changes over the past 20 years, enable her to do much better in the runoff than her father did? Paul Takoma Park, MD April 23,  3:21 PM ET Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 3:22 PM ET Paul, I see you weighing in from Takoma Park with the theme I touched on — did Le Pen get votes because she is a woman? Certainly she has come across as more “normal” than her father — a mother, divorced, and familiar, she says, with the lot of those who are not part of the elite. From a Reader I read that Northern France is a “Rust Belt” of sorts. How do manufacturing jobs, or lack thereof, figure in this election? And are those working-class voters analogous to those in the U.S.? Tom Dayton, ME April 23,  3:25 PM ET Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 3:25 PM ET Tom, manufacturing jobs figure pretty big in this election. De-industrialization has been a key theme for Le Pen. She campaigned in the French Rust Belt, the northeast part of France near Germany, and also places across the north where factories have been shuttered one after another  for lack of global competitveness. Workers there whom I’ve spoken with say she gets it. She’s calling for “intelligent protectionism” to reverse that, and promises to reverse de-industrialization. Though it is far from clear that her policies to “protect” France by pulling it away from Europe would achieve that. Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 3:26 PM ET In the coming duel, voters will be divided between the haves and have nots. Macron’s followers are entrepreneur types. Those who will vote Le Pen are those struggling with unstable jobs or to find work, and they don’t see themselves in Macron’s mold. I recently visited Calais, a town that has been ravaged by deindustrialization. None of the workers said they felt he understood them, although executives said they would vote for him if Fillon didn’t make it. From a Reader What is wrong with France wanting to maintain self-determination and limit immigration? Can’t one argue that this is essentially colonization by immigrants? Coming into a foreign country, changing its politics and culture? Jay Tampa, FL April 23,  3:26 PM ET Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 3:31 PM ET Jay expresses a concern about immigration, cultural change and French identity that a lot of Le Pen voters will relate to. The question is, will that concern be enough to propel her to victory in the second round? From a Reader I am new to the idea of a  two stage system. Is there a precedent of the reaming candidates making significant shifts in their platforms depending on who they face in the second round? Is it likely we will as a scenario where candidates spend a week “racing to the middle” to capture moderate votes? Marc Calgary, AB April 23,  3:33 PM ET Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 3:33 PM ET Hi, Marc. Thanks for your question. There isn’t necessarily a significant shift in the platforms themselves, but there is definitely a shift in which of their proposals they will highlight and how they will attack their opponents. It’s still a bit early to tell, but in this case I don’t expect a race to the middle: I think Macron and Le Pen will highlight how starkly they stand at opposite sides of the political spectrum; I don’t think they will rush to claim political ground in the middle. From a Reader Here in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, people seem to be greeting tonight’s result with a Gallic shrug – in many ways, the real wrestling match will take place over the next two weeks. Michael Johnston rue des Canettes -- Paris 6eme April 23,  3:35 PM ET Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 3:35 PM ET Hard to disagree with Michael from the 6th arrondissement (Paris is divided into 20 districts, called arrondissements). The question is, how low will Le Pen and Macron go? If I’m not mistaken, personal character tends to be less of a factor in French elections, where ideals and values are still the currency of debate. From a Reader I am watching the French TV stations, and both experts and people interviewed in the street who are not satisfied with the results are saying they will be unable to vote for either candidate. Do the blank “protest” votes count as abstentions, and how might they effect the results of the second round? Amy Paris April 23,  3:37 PM ET Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 3:38 PM ET Hi, Amy! No, blank votes (when the person puts an empty envelope, or one containing no name, into the ballot box) are not counted as abstentions. Moreover, they are not counted as part of the wider vote. Some would like that to be the case, and argue that if blank votes exceed 50 percent, the election should be void. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 3:38 PM ET What do we think of this prognostication from (our former colleague) Nate Silver? Clinton led Trump by 2-3 points Remain led Leave by 1-2 points Macron leads Le Pen by 26 points in runoff polls — Nate Silver on Twitter ( natesilver538 ) Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 3:42 PM ET A reminder for those who are joining us: Full official results for the country as a whole — those published on the website of the Interior Ministry — are not out yet. (They are locally in some areas.) What we have now are estimates by polling institutes, based on the first vote count. But since 8 p.m. in France, the trends have stayed the same : Macron ahead, Le Pen second, and Fillon and Mélenchon with very close scores battling for third and fourth place. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 3:43 PM ET With 34 percent of the vote counted, the Interior Ministry says that Marine Le Pen is leading, with 24.6 percent of the vote, followed by Emmanuel Macron, with 21.9 percent. A lot of votes remain to be counted, but the widespread consensus is that these two will make into the May 7 runoff. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 3:50 PM ET Of the other leading candidates, François Fillon, the center-right candidate, and Benoît Hamon, the Socialist, have conceded defeat and endorsed Macron. But the left-wing candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon has not conceded, noting that votes from some big cities have yet to be counted. (Early results show Fillon and Mélenchon nearly tied for third place.) Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 3:53 PM ET Although both Fillon and Hamon called on people to vote for Macron, neither did so enthusiastically. Hamon, who is from the left wing of the Socialist party, strenuously opposed lots of the pro-business measures that Macron supports. For Fillon, Macron is the continuation of François Hollande’s policies, which are widely rejected on the right. So their calls to vote for Macron are really calls to vote against Le Pen. Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 3:58 PM ET Aurelien, that has been seen as something of a handicap for Macron — the notion that he’s continuation of Hollande’s policies. But Macron, who’s a former Rothschild banker (a point that quite a few folks hold against him), split the Socialist party when he was France’s economy minister, for instance by calling for easing the 35-hour workweek, a law that the Socialists put in place over a decade ago. He’s also called for an “Uberization” of the French economy, code for softening rigid labor laws that employers say make it hard to hire and fire, and that keep French unemployment high. Basically, pro-business and pro-European Union. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 3:59 PM ET Just published: a news update from Alissa Rubin, our Paris bureau chief, who reports that Le Pen and Macron appear to be heading to a runoff. It is, she says, “a full-throated rebuke of France’s traditional mainstream parties.” Photo Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen Advance in French Election Mr. Macron, a political novice, and Ms. Le Pen, a far-right firebrand, appeared headed toward a runoff vote next month after voters rejected the mainstream parties. The New York Times Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 4:03 PM ET Alison, a lot of readers are asking what this means for the European Union. Macron is an advocate for European unity, and for the Franco-German alliance that has been the bedrock of stability on the Continent — but he knows that European integration is also a project under great stress. Le Pen wants France to leave the euro — which could doom the currency — and she has talked of a “Frexit,” or following Britain’s lead in leaving the European Union. How is Europe interpreting tonight’s result? Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 4:07 PM ET Germany certainly wants to keep its nerve but is relieved, as most European governments will be. There are signs that the mood has turned a bit better for European unity in recent months. Trump and “Brexit” have allowed the advantages of European togetherness to appear. Paméla Rougerie Intern, Paris bureau April 23, 4:10 PM ET Disappointed but not quitting. Mélenchon’s supporters are singing “Resistance, resistance !” at the end of his speech. #FrenchElections https://t.co/3FNEUzX5cu — Paméla Rougerie on Twitter ( pamelarougerie ) Elian Peltier Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 4:10 PM ET At Le Pen’s campaign headquarters, her supporters are cheering. “We are in the final!” Julien Favier chanted with his mother and his aunt, like after a soccer game in a local gymnasium in Hénin-Beaumont. “We’ve always voted for the National Front in my family,” he said, waving a French flag in one hand and a ‘Marine for President’ one in the other. “Tonight is our night.” Steven Erlanger London bureau chief April 23, 4:10 PM ET This is good news for pro-European centrists. Bad news for the far right. Bad news for Moscow; not great for Brexiters. Now can Macron win big and govern, or will he be another failed reformist French president? Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 4:12 PM ET Sewell and Alison, a lot of analysts say that even if Le Pen did win, it would be hard for her to achieve “Frexit.” Still, most European capitals seem to be betting that Macron will take the presidency, and that’s a best-case scenario for them since it would signal a possible cap, at least for now, on the rise of far-right political leaders in Western Europe. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 4:14 PM ET I just got an email from Neil MacFarquhar, our Moscow bureau chief. He points out that Moscow made clear its preference for either Fillon or Le Pen: “After the results were announced late Sunday, the main banner headline on Sputnik’s English-language news service was not the result, but ‘Police Use Smoke Pellets, Start Dispersing Protestors in Center of Paris.’ Much of the news reporting on state-run TV was straightforward news reports summarizing the numbers and anticipating the May 7 runoff.” Neil continues: “On one of the main late-night political discussion shows, the attacks against Macron started right away. ‘Macron has no ideology. He is somebody who is directed by American political advisers,’ said Vyacheslav Nikonov, a deputy from Putin’s ruling United Russia party in the State Duma, or Parliament.” Alison Smale Berlin bureau chief April 23, 4:15 PM ET As I have said before, the apparent result will calm Germany. But Europeans can only make things better — especially youth unemployment — with new ideas and action. Maybe Macron is young enough and clever enough and free enough of traditional party thinking to succeed. If not, I agree with Steve: It will be tough for France. Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 4:18 PM ET It’s hard to underscore just how pivotal this election outcome will be. France will essentially vote either to stay with Europe, or to pull away. Either choice will have major consequences for the future of France and of the European Union. Elian Peltier Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 4:20 PM ET For a lot of voters, Ms. Le Pen’s result had the taste of a bitter victory. In the northern city of Hénin-Beaumont, a National Front stronghold, locals said it would be tough for her to win the presidency. “I don’t think that she will win, but it is the beginning of a broader movement,” Manuel Hourriez, 50, told me. “I used to vote for the right, but I have changed my mind, because only Marine will protect us. I hope many more right-wing voters like me will realize that before the second round.” Other voters were much more pessimistic. “The dce are cast: It’s over. She’s going to lose miserably, like her father, 15 years ago,” Louis Widehem, 78, told me — remembering the 2002 election, in which her father made it into the runoff only to lose to Jacques Chirac. Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 4:21 PM ET Macron is speaking. He mentioned terrorism first, saying the country had been through a tough time recently, going through the challenges of terrorism and social division. Paméla Rougerie Intern, Paris bureau April 23, 4:30 PM ET Here in Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s headquarters, supporters are heavily disappointed but promise that they will keep fighting. Gregory Chigolet, one of his supporters, said he would not vote for Macron or Le Pen in the runoff. He wants Mélenchon to form a party and contest seats in the June legislative elections. “I think that Jean-Luc Mélenchon can now be the leader of the true left,” he said. “The Socialist Party is dead, and will be divided between people following Macron or him.” Aurelien Breeden Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 4:34 PM ET In his speech, Emmanuel Macron just said he wanted to become the “president of patriots, to face the threat of nationalists.” Lilia Blaise Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 4:40 PM ET Macron went onstage with his wife, Brigitte, and delivered the longest speech of the evening. He did not directly speak against Le Pen but said, “The challenge from tonight is not to go vote against anyone. The challenge is to decide to completely break with the system that has been unable to address the problems of our country for more than 30 years.” Benoît Morenne Reporter, Paris bureau April 23, 4:41 PM ET Macron said his duty in the next two weeks, before the May 7 runoff, would be to bring “people together behind my bid” and to create a winning coalition. He said that the two main parties — referring to the Republicans and the Socialists — had been “set aside” by the French people. Liz Alderman Chief business correspondent, Europe April 23, 4:41 PM ET In the end, Macron expressed a lot of hope and optimism, but didn’t really say what exactly he would do to change France. He will need to clarify that strongly in the next two weeks. Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 4:42 PM ET Macron just told supporters: “My fellow citizens, there aren’t different Frances: there is just one France, our France.” He closed with the standard rallying cry: “Vive la France!” Sewell Chan International news editor, London April 23, 4:42 PM ET To recap for readers: Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate, and Emmanuel Macron, the centrist independent, have thanked their supporters as they advance to the May 7 runoff for the French presidency.
