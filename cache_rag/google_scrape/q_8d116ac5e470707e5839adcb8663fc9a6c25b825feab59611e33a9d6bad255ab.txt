"In bringing Diablo III to consoles, our main focus has        been on making sure we deliver a really fun experience for up to four        friends online or on the same couch," said Mike Morhaime , CEO and        cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment . "The game looks and plays great on        PS3 ™ and Xbox 360, especially with the new direct-control        elements and new interface. We know players will have a blast battling Diablo on their big-screen TVs."
