Apple revealed the brand new iPhone 11 , 11 Pro , and 11 Pro Max on Sept. 10, and despite the questionable names, these are the best iPhone models money can buy. If you're looking to get your hands on one of these devices as soon as possible, there are few important dates you need to know. You could camp outside your local Apple Store on the release date to be the first in the line to grab one, but it's not necessary. You can preorder it instead and have it mailed to you the same day of the release date. As history has shown, preorders for new Apple smartphones go quick, so you need to be one of the first to preorder. If not, that arrival date will keep slipping back and back to the point where you wish you just waited in line at your local Apple Store. Don't Miss: How to Preorder an iPhone 11, 11 Pro, or 11 Pro Max Release Date: Sept. 20, 2019 This year, Apple will launch the entire 2019 iPhone lineup on the same date in September. If you're reading this on the day of the event, it's only ten days away. Starting Friday, Sept. 20, you can walk to most major wireless carriers and pick up an iPhone 11 model in stores. You can also purchase the iPhone in person at your local Apple Store and at Best Buy. The list below provides links to each company's store locator if you want to visit a physical location. Apple Stores AT&T Best Buy O2 (UK) Sprint T-Mobile US Cellular Verizon Wireless Vodafone (Australia) Vodafone (UK) Preorder Date: Sept. 13, 2019 If you want to get your hands on a new iPhone on day one of release but don't want to wait in any lines, preordering is the only way to go. Not only does it allow you to avoid the lines, but it gives you the best chance of getting the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max as soon as possible. Preorders start Friday, Sept. 13, at 5 a.m. (PDT), which gives you about a week of reserving a new iPhone model. But remember, new iPhone models are hot, so the faster you preorder, the better chances you have of getting one sooner. For example, if you're one of the first to preorder online via Apple's website, Sept. 20 should be the device's arrival date. Carriers and stores like Best Buy and Walmart may also have that time frame, but the longer you wait to preorder, the more likely that arrival date will be pushed back. Last year, specific models of the iPhone XS and XS Max sold out, with arrival dates pushed back two weeks or more just hours — even minutes — after preorders first went live. iPhone 11 Preorder from Apple Preorder from AT&T Preorder from Best Buy (cellular plan required) Preorder from O2 (UK) Preorder from Sprint Preorder from Target (cellular plan required) Preorder from T-Mobile Preorder from US Cellular Preorder from Verizon Wireless Preorder from Vodafone (Australia) Preorder from Vodafone (UK) Preorder from Walmart (cellular plan required) iPhone 11 Pro Preorder from Apple Preorder from AT&T Preorder from Best Buy (cellular plan required) Preorder from O2 (UK) Preorder from Sprint Preorder from Target (cellular plan required) Preorder from T-Mobile Preorder from US Cellular Preorder from Verizon Wireless Preorder from Vodafone (Australia) Preorder from Vodafone (UK) Preorder from Walmart (cellular plan required) iPhone 11 Pro Max Preorder from Apple Preorder from AT&T Preorder from Best Buy (cellular plan required) Preorder from O2 (UK) Preorder from Sprint Preorder from Target (cellular plan required) Preorder from T-Mobile Preorder from US Cellular Preorder from Verizon Wireless Preorder from Vodafone (Australia) Preorder from Vodafone (UK) Preorder from Walmart (cellular plan required) Shop for iPhone 11 Cases Online at Amazon Note: If you're on the iPhone Upgrade Program through Apple, make sure to check out the Apple Store app to get preapproved for the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max , so you can be among the first to preorder your new iPhone. More Info: Tips for Preordering the Hot New iPhones Before They Sell Out How Much Do These iPhones Cost? Apple's new iPhone models don't come in just one storage option. Each one has various options, divided by tier, which affect the price. To make things easier for you, here are all the different prices from Apple: iPhone 11, 64 GB — $699 iPhone 11, 128 GB — $749 iPhone 11, 256 GB — $849 iPhone 11 Pro, 64 GB — $999 iPhone 11 Pro, 256 GB — $1,149 iPhone 11 Pro, 512 GB — $1,349 iPhone 11 Pro Max, 64 GB — $1,099 iPhone 11 Pro Max, 256 GB — $1,249 iPhone 11 Pro Max, 512 GB — $1,449 Apple Programs Available To ease the burden on your wallet, Apple offers a finance program known as the iPhone Upgrade Program . Financed by Citizens One, it breaks down the total cost of the iPhone and AppleCare+ to 24 equal payments paid monthly. With this program, you can upgrade your iPhone every year. To do so, you must own the phone for at least six months, and have made the equivalent of 12 payments (50% of the value of the iPhone). You also have to be in good standing with Citizens One and have maintained AppleCare+ the whole time you've had it. If all things are in order, you can trade-in your current iPhone and upgrade to a new one. All tax is due at the time of purchase. What if you don't want to finance? Well, another option is to take advantage of Apple's Trade-Up Program . The program lets you trade in an eligible device toward payments on your iPhone 11 model. We recommend comparing the price Apple offers with third-party sites like eBay and Swappa to get the maximum trade-in value for your current device. More Info: Get the Most Value from Your iPhone Trade-In Carrier iPhone Upgrade Programs Available While Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program may be the sweetest deal, it has its problems. For instance, if you switch to an MVNO carrier such as Google Fi , you can't upgrade next time. That stipulation also applies to any of the carrier deals, but going the carrier route may be more convenient for your needs. AT&T The carrier's Next Plan makes fiancing your iPhone 11 easier by splitting the cost into 30 monthly installments with a 0% APR, though, AT&T adds a $5 charge each month. You can trade-in and upgrade after 50% of the device is paid off. All tax is due at the time of purchase. f you don't think you'll want to trade your new iPhone in to get a new iPhone 12 when they come out, you can join the AT&T Installment Plan instead without the $5 monthly charge. Sprint Sprint's iPhone Forever plan lets you lease a new iPhone for 18 months, sometimes at a discounted rate. After you make at least 12 monthly payments, you can trade it in for the latest version. If you don't upgrade after 12 months, you still have six months left on the lease. Afterward, you can either pay the difference for the full cost of the device or keep up monthly payments until you pay off the iPhone. An upgrade fee may apply. The iPhone Forever deal is a part of plans such as Sprint Flex . T-Mobile The company's JUMP! On Demand is an 18-month lease agreement where you can change your phone once every 30 days, for a max total of 12 each year. Just like leasing of a car, you don't own any phone during this time. To keep the monthly payments low, you will likely need to put a decent down payment. After a month, you can switch to another phone (for example, go from an iPhone 11 to 11 Pro or 11 Pro Max) but will have to pay another hefty down payment to keep the monthly payments the same. At the end of the 18 months, you can either pay off the difference or continue your monthly payments to pay off the phone to own it. There is also an Equipment Installment Plan (EIP) option which spreads the cost over 24 or 36 months, but the monthly payments are higher. Down payments may vary depending on the model and your creditworthiness. If you cancel wireless service, the remaining amount of the phone is due immediately. You can also add the optional Protection <360> to get JUMP! features. US Cellular US Cellular's Early Upgrade Program lets you spread the cost of the iPhone over 30 months. After your 24th installment payment (or 80% of the phone is paid off), you can upgrade to a new iPhone (or any other phone). Your account must be good standing, and the device must be good condition to qualify. Sales tax and an activation fee are due at time of purchase. Verizon Wireless Verizon plans let you upgrade after 30 days as long as 50% of your iPhone's retail price is paid off. Since the plan divides the monthly payments over 24 months at a 0% APR, you should reach that after a year, allowing to upgrade your iPhone each year. Your current iPhone needs to be in working condition and returned within 14 days of the new device payment agreement (the one you enter with the new iPhone). An activation fee will be billed to your next monthly statement. The iPhone is carrier-locked for the first 60 days, then unlocked automatically after.
