Known as “Ms. Earth” for her efforts to unify the community through gardens, she uses her experiences as a bilingual special education teacher to build inclusive environments. Urtubey serves on President Biden’s Advisory Commission on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics. In her keynote, Urtubey will share student, family, and educator stories that inspired the Joyous and Just Educational Framework. These powerful stories demonstrate what is possible when collective wellness and identity-affirming practices are centered in our educational designs. Educators will be inspired to reflect deeply on how their practice intersects with the principles of the Joyous and Just Educational Framework and what possibility lies ahead in their learning communities.
