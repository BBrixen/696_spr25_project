Announces 2020 California Teachers of the Year SACRAMENTO—State Superintendent of Public Instruction  Tony Thurmond today named five extraordinary educators as the 2020 California  Teachers of the Year. Thurmond, who began his career as a social  services worker, said he  is pleased to honor five  outstanding and talented teachers who have made a great impact in their schools  and communities. “These  five incredible teachers receive this prestigious honor for their focus, drive,  and determination to teach young people in California,” he said. “They are not  only wonderful representatives for our state, but they also make profound  differences in the lives of their students and their communities by employing innovative strategies to increase  academic success and narrow the achievement gap among a broad range of students.” Presented  by California Casualty and supported by the California Teachers of the Year  Foundation, the California Teachers of the Year Program began in 1972 to honor  outstanding teachers and encourage new teachers to enter the profession. The  2020 California Teachers of the Year are: Sean Bui, who is a ninth through twelfth  grade English language development and business law teacher at Cupertino High  School in Cupertino, Fremont Union High School District, Santa Clara County. Thurmond also nominated Bui as California’s  representative for the National Teacher of the Year competition. Bui will  compete against other state nominees, and the 2020 National Teacher of the Year  will be announced in the spring. Brenda  Barreras, who is a kindergarten teacher at Good Hope Elementary School in  Perris, Perris Elementary School District, Riverside County. Mandy  Kelly, who is a sixth grade multiple-subject teacher at Trabuco Mesa  Elementary School in Rancho Santa Margarita, Saddleback Valley Unified School  District, Orange County. Guy  Myers, who is a ninth through twelfth grade drama and musical theatre  teacher at John Burroughs High School in Burbank, Burbank Unified School District, Los  Angeles County. Katya  Robinson, who is a kindergarten through third grade special education  teacher at West Sonoma County Consortium School in Sebastopol, West Sonoma  County High School District, Sonoma County. Thurmond  said these teachers will be great ambassadors for the profession. Thurmond recently  launched a Teacher Shortage workgroup at the California Department of  Education (CDE) and said, “It is  important to motivate and inspire other  educators, champion the positive contributions of the teaching profession, and highlight the rewards of being a teacher.” “Great teachers are the core of a great  educational system. Yes, teaching changes lives of individual students, but beyond that,  teachers show us all that all children can achieve, no matter who they are,” he said.
