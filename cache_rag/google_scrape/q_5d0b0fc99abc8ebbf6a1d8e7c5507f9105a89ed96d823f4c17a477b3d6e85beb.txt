Nashville's Trondson and Zampardo, of Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich., led the way as the two 18s singles champions at last week's USTA Boys’ and Girls’ National Indoor Championships. No. 14 seed Trondson beat Sacramento's Emon van Loben Sels 6-4, 6-3 in the final. A Tennessee state champion at the Ensworth School in Nashville, Trondson will play college tennis next year at Oklahoma. En route to victory, Trondson knocked off two Top 10 seeds including Alex Fuchs (Los Altos, Calif.), who teamed up with van Loben Sels to win the boys’ 18s doubles title. The pair defeated No. 2 seeds Caden Hasler (Pleasant Grove, Utah) and Dylan Tsoi (El Dorado Hills, Calif.) 8-3 in an eight-game set to win the title. Sixth-seeded Zampardo upset top seed Valerie Glozman (Bellevue, Wash.), 6-1, 3- 6, 7-5 in the girls' final. ‹ › 2022 Indoor Nationals Champions 2022 Indoor Nationals Champions 2022 Indoor Nationals Champions 2022 Indoor Nationals Champions 2022 Indoor Nationals Champions 2022 Indoor Nationals Champions 2022 Indoor Nationals Champions 2022 Indoor Nationals Champions 2022 Indoor Nationals Champions 2022 Indoor Nationals Champions 2022 Indoor Nationals Champions Glozman notably finished runner-up at the USTA Girls’ 18s National Championships this summer, won a round in the US Open Qualifying Tournament, and was a member of the title-winning junior U.S. Billie Jean King Cup team last month.
