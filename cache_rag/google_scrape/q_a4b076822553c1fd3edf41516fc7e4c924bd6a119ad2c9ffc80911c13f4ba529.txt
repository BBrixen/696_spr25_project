Company type Public Traded as NYSE : OKLO Industry Nuclear energy Founded 2013 ; 12 years ago ( 2013 ) Founders Jacob DeWitte Caroline Cochran Headquarters Santa Clara, California, U.S. Area served Worldwide Products Aurora Powerhouse Reactor Number of employees 100 (2024) Website oklo.com Oklo Inc. is an advanced nuclear technology company based in Santa Clara, California. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Founded in 2013 by Jacob DeWitte and Caroline Cochran, both graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the company designs compact fast reactors with the aim of providing clean, safe, and affordable energy. OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman stepped down as chairman on April 2025 [ 3 ] to "avoid a conflict of interest ahead of talks between his company and the nuclear start-up on an energy supply agreement." [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The company's name is derived from Oklo , a region in the country of Gabon , Africa where self-sustaining nuclear fission reactions occurred approximately 1.7 billion years ago. [ 6 ] Oklo's business model is focused on selling power to customers, and its main product line for producing power is the Aurora nuclear reactor powerhouse product line. The Aurora powerhouse is a design for a small power plant to generate 15-50 MWe of electrical power [ 7 ] via a Siemens or similar power generation system and utilizing a compact fast neutron reactor to produce heat. Fast reactors were first implemented in the 1950s, with around 20 in operation at a time, [ 8 ] demonstrating safety benefits over thermal-neutron reactors . The Aurora is intended for off-grid applications, including data centers , artificial intelligence , remote communities , industrial sites, and military bases . It will be able to operate for up to 10 years without refueling. Oklo also intends to produce radioisotopes through its nuclear fuel recycling process and fast reactor technology. [ 9 ] These radioisotopes have a wide range of applications, including medical diagnostic imaging and cancer treatment ; industrial uses like non-destructive testing and process control ; and energy applications including radioisotope thermoelectric generators , nuclear batteries and fusion research . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] As a liquid metal cooled fast reactor, the Aurora powerhouse will possess a number of advantages in terms of its operation and safety. The Aurora has strongly negative reactivity feedback coefficients which emerge from the system's physics. These inherent feedback mechanisms will reduce reactor power in response to temperature excursions without any operator intervention or active safety systems. This was demonstrated in the Shutdown Heat Removal Test series at Experimental Breeder Reactor-II, [ 13 ] a sodium fast reactor operated between 1964 and 1994 that inspired much of the design of the Aurora powerhouse. Oklo's application for a combined construction and operating license for the Aurora powerhouse was initially denied by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on January 6th, 2022. [ 14 ] The NRC cited a lack of information provided by Oklo during the application process and that Oklo could re-submit in the future. Oklo plans to build its first Aurora powerhouse at Idaho National Laboratory in 2027. [ 15 ] Oklo has also signed letters of intent with Diamondback Energy and Wyoming Hyperscale to provide electricity for Diamondback's Permian Basin operations and Wyoming Hyperscale's data center campus over 20-year periods. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] The company has received venture capital from various investors, including Hydrazine Capital, founded by Sam Altman with Peter Thiel as its sole limited partner; Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz ; Ron Conway of SV Angel ; Kevin Efrusy of Accel Partners ; and Tim Draper of Draper Associates. [ 18 ] In July 2023, it was announced that the company planned to go public via a special purpose acquisition company at a value of $850 million. [ 19 ] On May 10, 2024, Oklo merged with AltC Acquisition Corp, a SPAC founded and led by Sam Altman, receiving $306 millions in gross proceeds.
