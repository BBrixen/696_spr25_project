Switch 2 was officially revealed on 16th January 2025, yet rumours circulated for almost as long as its predecessor had been on store shelves. It wasn't until May last year that Nintendo announced its intentions to reveal a Switch successor before the end of the 2024/25 fiscal year. In this guide, we'll recap the entire story leading up to the official announcement of Nintendo Switch 2, including a timeline of all the rumours, speculation, and outright leaks concerning the console. We'll start with the most recent and work backwards... On this page: Nintendo Switch 2: Rumours & Leaks Timeline 1. Were there any legit Nintendo Switch 2 leaks? 2.

On 13th March, a newly updated patent lent further credence to the rumour that AI upscaling could be used in Switch 2. On 13th March, Famiiboards member LiC shared shipping details apparently showing 383,000 Switch 2 units had been transported to the US already. On 13th January, podcaster Nate the Hate claimed that Nintendo would officially reveal Switch 2 on Thursday 16th January in a video similar to the original Switch reveal. The reveal trailer did indeed drop on that day. On 8th January 2025, accessory maker Genki revealed a Switch 2 "replica" shown behind closed doors at CES 2025. A page on the firm's website also showcased an animated video of the system with accessories attached. Genki's CEO claimed that the magnetic Joy-Con can be removed by brute force without pressing the release button and that indentations on the console make it incompatible with the original Switch's dock . In response to the images and information presented by Genki, Nintendo commented to Japanese outlet Sankei on 9th January that they were "not official" . This was after Nintendo "lawyers" reportedly made contact at CES. The subsequent official reveal confirmed Genki's model was a close match for the genuine article. On 1st January 2025, photos claimed to be of the Switch 2's motherboard were posted to Reddit . The images appear to match previous component leaks from September 2024. In December 2024, someone claiming to have handled the final retail model took to Reddit and reiterated several rumours, including magnetic Joy-Con, 4K output, and the name 'Switch 2'. They also added further details including mentions of a wider, shorter dock. These details were confirmed to be accurate following the official reveal in January. Accessory maker Dbrand's CEO, Adam Ijaz, claimed that an image of the console in one of its cases is the actual Switch 2. He also provided The Verge with exact measurements which he said were based on a 3D scan of the hardware. Mention of Samsung's SD Express tech in a Nintendo of America job listing led to speculation that Switch 2 may use the upcoming micro SD cards for higher transfer speeds. Nintendo is aiming to manufacture and ship approximately 7 million Switch 2 units ahead of launch, according to a rumour concerning initial shipments that came to light on 20th November 2024. A series of unverified, 'leaked' Switch 2 images (confirmed to be accurate following the reveal) appeared online on 18th September 2024. These images supposedly show larger Joy-Con controllers with rounded edges and extra buttons, and an additional USB-C slot on the top edge of the main unit, beside a headphone jack. YouTube channel 小宁子 XNZ published a video showing a 3D-printed version of the 'leaked' Switch 2 model comparing it to the current, smaller model. In December, YouTube channel SwitchUp took a closer look at a similar 3D-printed model from case manufacturer iVolver. Earlier in September , "industry insider" Nate the Hate claimed that Switch 2 "has backwards compatibility support". This has since been officially confirmed . The CEO of accessory company Blade claimed that Nintendo was eyeing a March or April 2025 launch date for Switch 2, depending on the firm's financial results. Other claims in a post on Reddit suggest that the new Joy-Con controllers may integrate scroll wheel-style shoulder buttons. Were there any legit Nintendo Switch 2 leaks? Just a few! Various Switch 2 leaks occurred in the months leading up to the public reveal, which were confirmed as accurate on 16th January 2025 with the official announcement. Prior to confirmation, some of the images and information purporting to show the console were widely considered legitimate. Tech experts considered images showing what appeared to be the Switch 2's motherboard to be authentic, and it became clear that many of the internal tech leaks popping up across the internet were also accurate. On 5th January 2025, two photos depicting what looked like the left Joy-Con controller from the Switch 2 were posted online . Eventually proved to be real, although it was unconfirmed at the time, they were the most convincing hardware 'leaks' so far. To back this up, users online had tested the supposed serial number from the controller on Nintendo's own warranty website, seemingly confirming its authenticity. The August 2024 hack of Pokémon developer Game Freak , which came to light in October 2024 , resulted in leaked material containing references to 'Ounce', believed to be an internal company codename for Switch 2. Photos purporting to show 'Switch 2' prototype moulds and 3D renders of the upcoming console appeared plausible according to industry experts Digital Foundry, now confirmed. Related Articles Rumour Supposed 'Switch 2' Design Photos And Specs Surface Online Take with a truck-load of salt What is the history of Nintendo Switch 2? Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa discussed in May 2022 how cautiously the company is approaching the launch of the Switch's successor, be it a Switch 2 or some new console concept. In September 2022 , an Nvidia employee confirmed the existence of the T239 system-on-a-chip, a long-rumoured frontrunner for the silicon Nintendo would use in a Switch 2. In March 2023 , chip rumours surfaced once again, with further mentions of the T239. Following the FTC vs. Microsoft case in the US, it was reported that executives at Activision-Blizzard had met with Nintendo to discuss the Switch 2 in December 2022. While significant details of the resulting documents are redacted, Activision had implied that the next Nintendo console would be comparable to PS4 and Xbox One performance-wise. In June 2023 , while discussing the disappointing commercial performance of Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope , Ubisoft's CEO Yves Guillemot stated that the company intends to "update [the game] for the new machine that will come in the future," explicitly referencing Nintendo's Switch successor. While no details were supplied, the ability to port games over to the next platform suggested that Nintendo's follow-up would be similar in form to the current Switch. In July 2023 , it was claimed that development kits were with multiple "key partner studios". Nintendo reportedly demoed Switch 2 hardware at Gamescom to select developers and games media, with sources indicating that the power of the new hardware was demonstrated and that a version of Breath of the Wild was used to showcase the new Nintendo console's power. This was apparently a demonstration only and there was no indication Nintendo plans to release an updated version of that Switch launch title. In February 2024 , Brazilian journalist Pedro Henrique Lutti Lippe claimed that the next hardware will not be released until Q1 2025. This report was quickly corroborated by both VGC and Eurogamer . On Tuesday 7th May 2024, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa released a statement saying that the Nintendo "Switch successor" will be announced "within this fiscal year" — so, 'Switch 2' would be revealed before 31st March 2025. On Wednesday 6th November 2024, as part of Nintendo's six-month financials report presentation, Shuntaro Furukawa confirmed that Switch software would be playable on the Switch successor. He also confirmed that Nintendo Switch Online would be available on the new system. On Thursday 16th January, Nintendo posted a reveal video to YouTube initially titled 'An Update from Nintendo', later changed to 'Nintendo Switch 2 - First-look trailer' - officially revealing "the successor to Nintendo Switch" and the 2025 release window. A Switch 2 Nintendo Direct is scheduled to be broadcast on 2nd April 2025. What do people mean by the 'Switch Pro'? Rumours of a new Switch began early in the system's life. In January 2019, analysts predicted multiple new Switch SKUs, including both a Switch Lite and a Switch 'Pro' . Nintendo dismissed these rumours, saying that a "successor" wasn't being considered at the time, although both Switch Lite and the then-unknown Switch OLED model are variations on the base console. Various rumours surrounding a 'Switch Pro' did the rounds throughout 2020 and 2021, although many of these were related to Switch OLED, not a next-generation Switch with notable performance improvements. In September 2021, reports surfaced of developers using 4K Switch software tools provided by Nintendo. Nintendo swiftly issued a denial . A patent was subsequently made public suggesting that Nintendo is working on upscaling technology, and 'Switch Pro' speculation reignited after references appeared following a massive Nvidia leak in March 2022. Whether this referred to a cancelled Switch 'Pro' variant or the true Switch 2 is unknown. In December 2022, Digital Foundry claimed that Switch Pro was indeed real at one point, but it was cancelled by Nintendo. Up Next: How Many Games Fit In Internal Storage?

Author Profile Reply Comments 63 1 hashkey Tue 30th May 2023 Nintendo seem to have done a good job lately of keeping its secrets secret. Fair play. 10 2 Arcata Wed 31st May 2023 Theres no way its not happening next year. This is the longest a Nintendo console has ever been on the market before a successor has replaced it by 2 years more than average. 2 3 MrTeg Wed 31st May 2023 So basically no one has a clue. 16 4 HolyGeez03 Thu 1st Jun 2023 If Switch 2 can play all games at 1080p/60 with the dock upscaling to 2160p, I would be happy. Anything more than that is highly unlikely. 8 5 undeadly Sun 4th Jun 2023 Here's a bunch of words. They say nothing 😆 13 6 aSmilingMan Mon 5th Jun 2023 I just hope they don’t botch it and actually make a Switch 2 (beefed up Switch) instead of a Switch U (weird innovative attempt that no-one cares for). My wishlist is: better processor and graphics, better joysticks that don’t drift and audio jack on the pro controller. Anything else would be a plus. 7 7 Clammy Wed 7th Jun 2023 It’s Nintendo… it’ll be something totally unexpected. A console you control by clenching your keagal muscles and the screen is projected onto your bare chest, or something. 3 8 nintendr0ne Thu 29th Jun 2023 TBH, I dont care much about the power of consoles anymore. A PC and a Switch is the best combo. PC will always beat the consoles in term of power, and 90% of the PS5 "Exclusives" and 100% of the Xbox catalogue are released on Steam. The Switch is for nintendo exclusives, most being masterpieces and are free of woke degeneracy found on 3/4 of the Xbox and PS5 titles. I have two requests to Nintendo for the switch 2 or whatever it will be called. 1. No more 30FPS games. I dont care about 4k, but please, all games should runs at 60FPS without exception 2. backward compatibility. I have huge collection of switch 1 games. If backward compatability is not possible, then please release a cheap switch TV that you can connect to the TV like Sony did with the PSVITA TV. 3 9 Fragslayer Sun 2nd Jul 2023 @nintendr0ne yeah I dunno, I agree with most that but definitely your alone on resolution. TOTK could have been GOTY for the next 5 years. It's reviews were way to kind. No I absolutely don't need nor want native 4k by any means. Definitely good upscaling tech or I'm out of the next one. Couldn't see fish in the water bugs on trees nothing BOTW looked and ran way better. That being said the other thing ruining the game which you did mention Framerates. Technically this is all pointless as it's all a given thed have to be on par with XB1X and PS Pro. The catalog of Nvidia chips right now are great. What they need to do is make sure we have access to our games especially the later games such as TOTK and get free upgrades I paid my dues at 70 bucks. 0 10 nintendr0ne Sun 2nd Jul 2023 @Fragslayer I assume they will use upscaling techniques with DLSS provided by the nvidia chip. In that case, great. What I meant st, they should not downgrade graphics or framerate to get high resolution. 30 FPS is playable, but after long sessions, It makes me sick, while 60 butter smooth FPS does not.game are just more enjoyable a 60 and more. 120 is even better but not as much when you go from 30 to 60. I played TOTK on my PC with yuzu @ 60 FPS, I cannot go back playing on the switch. 0 11 falkyn Fri 14th Jul 2023 enhancement is possible without sacrifice. enhancement is possible without perversion. 1 12 falkyn Wed 19th Jul 2023 may the switch 2 bring forth the uprise of the 32-pixel bit tripled animated frame art sprite army. (i.e. if there are about 100 sprite arts for all of mega man x's movements, then it should be increased to 300 sprites to fill in more of the missing degrees of movement, instead of the dev relying on the player's imagination to fill it in for them. this means devs spend more time on a single game instead of devs making more games with less frame arts and only 8-bit, 16bit pixels. there are a lot of trash games in the nintendo e-shop. a lot of those trash games have their trash opinions - adding to nintendo's detriment. [self-aware of my trash comment that nintendo life so generously allows me to leave here.]) 0 13 Slownenberg Mon 4th Sep 2023 @nintendr0ne eh, 30 frames or 60 frames doesn't really matter. For 95% of games 30fps is perfect. 60 looks slightly smoother and you only really notice it in something like a first person shooter where you pan the camera around a lot because panning the camera does indeed look silky smooth at 60fps but at 30fps it just looks fine. Doing 60fps on all games on a handheld system is just a waste of resources. Only fast paced games like racers or first person shooters with all the camera panning need 60fps. They just need to make sure all games are locked at 30fps next gen so you don't get the occasional slowdown like you see on some Switch games where they tried to push graphics and stuff too much. 3 14 Slownenberg Mon 4th Sep 2023 Holiday 2024 makes sense. They could of course keep going for another year or more beyond that with price cuts and more games but I doubt they have more Switch games in the pipeline past 2024. Just do a $350 (or maybe a cheaper ~$330 base version and a premium ~$380 version at launch) generational leap over the Switch, launching holiday next year, thats the exact same concept/design as the Switch but with iterative improvements to refine the design to near-perfection, call it the Switch 2, don't do anything crazy just straight upgrade. Make joycons slightly larger / slightly better, make sure they don't have joystick drift, and make the physical rail connection between the joycons and the system stronger. Launch it with an amazing new 3D Mario day 1 with Mario Kart 9 coming out a few weeks later, maybe Metroid Prime 4 (if it doesn't come out on Switch) also in the launch time frame. Have NSO running on it from day 1, have a totally improved and redone online setup in which friend codes are finally dead so that people can use actual readable usernames and you can actually communicate with friends online through the system and in-game with audio, and all online games have really easy way to play with friends, random matchmaking, and random matchmaking plus friends at the same time. Use DLSS tech to get current gen console ports without the graphical downgrading such ports required on the Switch (by knocking framerate down to 30, knocking res from console 4k down to under 540p and then using DLSS to bump it back up on the cheap to like 720p in handheld or 900p/1080p docked). Have full backwards compatibility with the Switch. Still have decent battery life have at least 128gb disk space. Heck maybe even announce on launch day that Gamecube games will get added to NSO in the first 12 months. Do that, which is all pretty common sense, and Switch 2 will continue Switch's success. 60fps games don't matter and really should absolutely not be a priority for a handheld system. 4k doesn't matter at all, maaaybe with DLSS 4k could be possible but shouldn't be a priority. 4k in docked mode would be a nice marketing line though, but if it is gonna make the system too expensive it isn't necessary. They can always release a slightly more powerful upgrade model later in the gen that can do 4k. 0 15 dystome Tue 12th Sep 2023 Ah, so in conclusion, Nintendo will release a new console of some description, at some point, probably. Assuming the Tegra 239 rumours are well founded, I reckon that gives us roughly XBox Series S level performance. I can believe that would play BotW at native 4k, though I doubt ports of more recent games will reliably make it above 1080p. Then again, if DLSS is good enough, maybe that doesn't matter as much. I've yet to see it in action... 1 16 8bit4Life Mon 26th Feb 2024 I’m hoping that Monolithsoft updates all of the Xenoblade Chronicles games to take advantage of better frame rates, and that they finally release a remastered Xenoblade Chronicles X. 1 17 wizzgamer Sun 2nd Jun 2024 @Arcata The Game Boy was out for 9 years before the Colour succeeded it. 1 18 MrCarlos46 Sun 15th Dec 2024 We’re reaching the end of 2024, and no Switch 2 news other than backwards compatibility with Switch games and NSO coming over has been announced. Now it just leaves us wondering when it will be announced when will it come out, and what could be the price. If the Switch 2 is gonna have a similar release timeframe as the Switch, 4-5 months, then it will probably come out near the end of the first half of 2025. For example, if the Switch 2 gets revealed in January, with a showcase in March or April, then it would leave it to get released in May or June. But then since there are already many Switch 2 units manufactured and ready to get sent to stores, we might actually see it in March or April, but that could probably be a short amount of time to market it after a January reveal (it would only be 2 months from the time of announcement to release). A January reveal and March release could also have the reveal and showcase as one full event rather than separate ones. And then release timeframes are also getting shorter these days, like Apple releasing new products only weeks after revealing them, so no surprise if Nintendo only has 2-3 months of marketing the Switch 2 after it gets revealed. If they do a January reveal and release it in February, I’m pretty sure it would already start selling out fast. Now for the price: It’s pretty likely Switch 2 will be more expensive than the Switch with the extra power it’s set to have, as well as other things that can jack up the price. Probably somewhere at $399 or $449. But with you-know-who becoming president of the US soon, he also has plans to put tariffs on products imported from countries like China or Vietnam, so this could lead to the Switch 2’s price in the US being somewhere at $499, $549 or $599. We’ll just have to wait and see what they price it at, especially if the price is low before tariffs start being implemented and depending on how the tariffs get implemented, if they do. 0 19 bones Fri 27th Dec 2024 I think Switch 2 or Super Nintendo Switch will be revealed on the week Mon 3rd to 10th of Feb. Or March 10th Mario day or very near that date if that date is a weekend day. 0 20 Isenlia Thu 2nd Jan 2025 Please Nintendo end the daily rumour mill and just announce the console already... 1 21 Diowine Thu 2nd Jan 2025 With all the leaks around, we vaguely know everything about it, being hybrid, the power, size, controllers, etc.. Delaying the official announcement is weird at this point. Only thing we need to know now is an official release date and the launch games. 1 22 rjejr Thu 2nd Jan 2025 “ The new Nintendo console will be announced "this fiscal year" (ending 31st March 2025) 'Switch 2' will be backwards compatible with the current Nintendo Switch “ Based on the title these 2 sentences could have been the entire article.😂 1 23 joey302 Fri 3rd Jan 2025 Everything sounds great so far just FIX THE ESHOP because it still sucks! Thanks 1 24 HalBailman Fri 3rd Jan 2025 "With the official reveal now confirmed for sometime before 31st March 2025" - really? What's the source? All that I recall is Nintendo will "make an announcement about the Switch successor". That announcement could be just basic information and a date for a reveal. It could even be to announce it won't come until 2026. 🤣 Yes, that's unlikely, so please no one start an argument. Even "The new Nintendo console will be announced 'this fiscal year'" written early in the article is a dubious read of Nintendo's tweet from mid last year. So many media outlets have been deliberately derelict in reporting it accurately in their headlines so to earn clicks, and that's led to so much confusion and misinformation out there. All I'm saying is don't expect a "reveal" because Nintendo never said that. They could do it. Just don't expect it. To me, the biggest clue is "coming soon" recently added to the original and vague "2025" release of Metroid Prime 4. That suggests Nintendo are priming for a Metroid Prime 4 release around April and that will be the key focus of the usual Direct in mid February. At the end of the Direct will be a tease of the Switch 2 and a "summer 2025" reveal. Release would be around September. Remember, I'm probably the number 1 "source" in the world that said the Switch Pro was a complete fantasy. Of course, I'm not a source. I'm simply someone that can look at Nintendo's history, watch their behaviour, and make logical and obvious extrapolations. 2 25 Lord Fri 3rd Jan 2025 They are only feeding you the info you won’t get told in the reveal. Unlike the competition a Nintendo reveal doesn’t talk spec it shows off functionality. So all the leaks on spec are all planed elements of hype to make the actual reveal land well. 2 26 chardir Fri 3rd Jan 2025 Everything we know about the Switch successor: There will be an announcement (not necessarily a reveal) by the end of March. It will be backwards compatible with Switch software (not necessarily hardware) Everything else is speculation and leaks. 1 27 chardir Fri 3rd Jan 2025 @HalBailman I think a March release of Switch 2 with a cross-gen Metroid Prime 4 as a launch title is still feasible. But your timeline with Spring MP4 and an Autumn Switch 2 release does seem likely now. 0 28 johnedwin Fri 3rd Jan 2025 quite a few nintendo youtubers were hinting at a reveal jan 08 and a release in march 2025.. 0 29 WheresWaveRace Fri 3rd Jan 2025 I’m guessing the next Mario Kart will be MK10 (or MKX) as 8Deluxe is so huge and extended beyond the original WiiU 8 it’s likely its own numbered entry. 0 30 WheresWaveRace Fri 3rd Jan 2025 @HalBailman finally some sense! Agree with everything you said. You are now my number 1 source for logical and obvious extrapolations! 0 31 Knightrider1 Sat 4th Jan 2025 Oh one thing to avoid that makes Steam Deck a pain to travel with, ensure games can play played offline without the need to be online. 0 32 Arawn93 Sat 4th Jan 2025 What we actually 100% know as from Nintendo lips? Next to nothing lol. 3 33 Euler Sat 4th Jan 2025 @WheresWaveRace Skipping 9 and going straight to 10 (or « X ») is a douchey thing to do but there’s no reason to think Nintendo would do it. 7 and 8 are the only numbered games in the series. They’d more likely call it by some other creative title after its new gimmick, or just name it after the new console if feasible. 0 34 WheresWaveRace Sat 4th Jan 2025 @Euler I agree they are more likely to go with a creative name more representative of whatever the new thing is about the next version that they want to emphasise. I just think if they choose to go with a numbered entry again I think they’ll consider it to be the 10th or even 11th version of MK when you add MKTour into the mix. IIRC they went with using 7 as it’s considered a lucky number in many places around the world and 8 as it makes a figure of 8 track. If there’s an extreme element perhaps MKXtreme! Who knows. I sure hope it looks and feels different to 8D. 0 35 Euler Sun 5th Jan 2025 @WheresWaveRace Had forgotten about Tour, so if they count that there's an argument for calling it Mario Kart 10/X. They consider Run as part of the main Super Mario series, so there's precedent. 0 36 Semmy Mon 6th Jan 2025 Hey everyone I believe that the Nintendo switch 2 maybe be compatible with your current switch games, and it may even fit in your old dock(s) 0 37 MrCarlos46 Tue 14th Jan 2025 Anything yet regarding the UI and if it will have more themes like how the Switch originally was gonna have? 0 38 Calomy Tue 14th Jan 2025 I am hoping it is called, a Super Switch, or Better yet an Ultra Switch, what would be real amazing is if the dock also functioned as a projector, giving it more portability. I would also love a return of the DS 3ds download play feature. Defiantly want more storage space as the original system did not have enough, and even with micro sd card it is not enough, I currently have a 500 GB Micro sd card, and I am thinking even if I had 1TB one it still would not be enough. So tired of having to pick and cheese which games I keep and delete, especially if you feel like playing something on a whim. Also No more Joy con drift. My right joycon also stopped working as a second controller, it still works, but I can only use it as a pair, the green light does not illimunte anymore when I press the sync button. 0 39 ChHa Wed 15th Jan 2025 Tldr: We know nothing 1 40 Uncle_Franklin Fri 17th Jan 2025 Splatoon 3 should have been for Switch 2, Switch really did not need another entry. 0 41 h3s Fri 17th Jan 2025 So is the c button that was present in some of the leaks not real. (I nearly always play docked but I would like the option of the map Wii u style for some games) 0 42 OFFICIALMichi Fri 17th Jan 2025 How am I going to charge my NES controllers 0 43 BulkSlash Mon 20th Jan 2025 Everything we know: It's bigger and it's called Switch 2. 2 44 Jack_Goetz Mon 20th Jan 2025 The microphone is for Nintendo's new smart assistant 'Navi'. "Navi, how long until Splatoon 4's DLC is released?" "Splatoon 4's DLC should be released by 2035!" 0 45 falkyn Mon 20th Jan 2025 Could the switch 2 be a porter to take down dolphin emulator? 0 46 Bunkerneath Mon 20th Jan 2025 Great, we got a first look at the ugliness, but what we need is proper specs. Is the screen LCD? OLED? something else? What processing power is, what is the docked screen output. How much hard drive space. So many questions very little answers except look how cool we are in black, and what about the extra button on the back of the joycon? 1 47 PinderSchloss Mon 20th Jan 2025 Ok the Mario Kart 9 bit is better now : ) Cautious speculation instead of “Oh no they ruined Donkey’s Face in the new Mario Kart 9. And aren’t these too many racers??” 0 48 DaftSkunk Mon 20th Jan 2025 I really don't get how they can not offer an OLED screen at launch, especially given OLED is now table stakes in many applications. After upgrading to the Switch OLED a few years back, it's a game changer for handheld mode and I'm not sure I can go back. 0 49 Kiliomp Mon 20th Jan 2025 4k in dock? They must've used switch 1 hardware to show off the new Mario Kart 0 50 RootsGenoa Mon 20th Jan 2025 I have a new idea for the new button, that makes sense since it's located just below the home button. If you assume the Switch 2 will be able to offer quick resume to several games at a time like the Xbox Series (it has as much RAM as the Series S after all), that button could allow you to go from a game to another, like Alt-Tab on PC. 0 51 AG_Awesome Tue 21st Jan 2025 Apparently the 8nm vs 5nm will determine if the system is any good or not (according to Reddit). 😂🤣😂🤣 0 52 purpleDino Tue 21st Jan 2025 Wish there was the base model with an LCD screen in order to keep the price down for the consumer/profits for Nintendo but that they offered an option to purchase an OLED S2 version at a higher cost. e.g. LCD $400 vs OLED $500. High enough to satisfy initial profits for Nintendo/stakeholders and yet good enough to satisfy those who have accepted the S1 OLED as the visual standard for 2025 and beyond (in addition to those with OLED mobiles and TVs which have flooded the market over the past few years) 0 53 daggdroppen Wed 22nd Jan 2025 I’m wondering about two things about the screen: What screen size will it be; 8 or 8.4 inches? What resolution will it have; 720 or 1080? I assume it will have 1080, but that is not certain. 0 54 MrCarlos46 Wed 22nd Jan 2025 @AG_Awesome Context? 0 55 AG_Awesome Wed 22nd Jan 2025 @MrCarlos46 there had been several debates and discussions focusing on the size of a chip following one of the motherboard leaks. Actually it was the empty space where the chip would be. The debate is if it would be 8nm or 5nm, with people adamant that the 8nm would stunt the system and make Nintendo lower clock speeds during handheld play so the battery wouldn’t drain. And other people said because it’s custom architecture that it could be the larger (but less efficient) chip and still run just fine. It’s me being tongue in cheek because the debate and discussion about it was the talk of the town for a few days during the last leak. To the point it was almost apocalyptic and people said the system would be worthless, out dated junk without a 5nm. It got pretty wild. 0 56 MrCarlos46 Wed 22nd Jan 2025 @AG_Awesome I guess we’re not sure how 8nm vs. 5nm will actually affect the Switch 2. 0 57 AG_Awesome Wed 22nd Jan 2025 @MrCarlos46 Exactly. We just have to wait and see. People jump the gun and get gloom and doom too quickly. 1 58 MrCarlos46 Wed 22nd Jan 2025 @AG_Awesome But if 8nm does affect battery life, expect battery levels similar to Switch V1 when playing highly demanding games if they don’t underclock. If that’s what happens, we’ll probably see a revised model with improved battery life in a year or two. Still not sure if they will actually do that or avoid another Switch 1 scenario and put a pretty good battery life from the start so they don’t have to change it later on. 0 59 Gryffin Sun 26th Jan 2025 It's interesting that the logo and 2 extend beyond the "Switch" instead of being flush 1 60 Papasears1982 Tue 11th Feb 2025 just waiting on pre order date (b ' ' )b 0 61 lukeg0117 Sat 8th Mar 2025 I bought a 4k 60hz LG TV specifically for Nintendo Switch 2... hopefully it is compatible with those settings! 0 62 KnightofJc Wed 9th Apr 2025 I'm exicited for the switch 2 but I'm also worried about the pricing for the console 0 63 HalBailman Yesterday, 8:06am Interesting reading the comments after 2 years. 2ArcataThu 1st Jun 2023 "Theres no way its not happening next year [2024]. This is the longest a Nintendo console has ever been on the market before a successor has replaced it by 2 years more than average." Wrong! Just like the Switch Pro fantasy, a 2024 Switch 2 release was something the media pushed hardest despite even contrary evidence like Nintendo, in May 2024, saying "an announcement about the Switch successor" by 31 March 2025. How a 2025 announcement got twisted into a 2024 release is mind boggling. 4HolyGeez03Fri 2nd Jun 2023 "If Switch 2 can play all games at 1080p/60 with the dock upscaling to 2160p, I would be happy." A wish more than fulfilled! (In late 2024) "MrCarlos46Mon 16th Dec 2024 We’re reaching the end of 2024, and no Switch 2 [release] news. If the Switch 2 is on a similar release timeframe as the Switch, 4-5 months, then it will probably come out near the end of the first half of 2025. For example, if the Switch 2 gets revealed in January, with a showcase in March or April, then it gets released in May or June." The video in January was more a tease and an announcement of the reveal date, otherwise spot on! (Same comment on prices) "Probably somewhere at $399 or $449. But with you-know-who becoming president of the US soon, he also has plans to put tariffs on products imported from countries like China or Vietnam, so this could lead to the Switch 2’s price in the US being somewhere at $499, $549 or $599." Nailed the price. Wrong on tariffs. I would often comment that electronics were never part of discussion with tariffs as there was no American industry to protect. The first major call on tariffs was actually to exempt electronics. HalBailmanFri 3rd Jan 2025 "To me, the biggest clue is "coming soon" recently added to the original and vague "2025" release of Metroid Prime 4. That suggests Nintendo are priming for a Metroid Prime 4 release around April and that will be the key focus of the usual Direct in mid February. At the end of the Direct will be a tease of the Switch 2 and a "summer 2025" reveal. Release would be around September." Yes, humble old me. 😛 The Direct was a few weeks later and the Switch 2 tease was forced out in January to end the rumour cycle. The reveal and release are a few months earlier. I thought September based on that window for MP4. Its release was soon reverted to "2025", which meant later in the year and now a big hole to fill mid year. NL Article: "Were there any legit Nintendo Switch 2 leaks? Just a few!" The actual physical evidence were the only correct ones, and even the motherboard is still to be verified. The vast majority, particularly about release dates, were wrong. Most leaks were actually rumours or speculation anyway, which didn't help with credibility and kept fuelling more. 0 Show Comments Leave A Comment Hold on there, you need to login to post a comment...
