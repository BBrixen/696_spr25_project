Top 10 Players of the 2010s (2010-2019) Thread starter Thread starter clout Start date Start date Sep 21, 2019 clout Hall of Fame Sep 21, 2019 #1 I saw this "best of 2010s" series by a Youtuber who covers the NBA so that gave me the idea to do one on this forum about tennis in the 2010s. So let's start with the top 10 players of this decade. starting from the 2010 season until the 2019 season. IMO: 1. Novak Djokovic (definitely the GOAT of this decade) 2. Rafael Nadal (any other decade prior to 2000, 2010s Rafa would've been that decade's GOAT) 3. Roger Federer (his best days came in the 2000s, but Roger was still very elite throughout this decade despite being in his 30s for much of it) 4. Andy Murray (he's had his fair share of great moments, but never won at a prolific rate the way the three above him have) 5. Stan Wawrinka (came into this decade as an above average top 20-25 player and ended it as a 3x slam winner while battling in some classic with the players above) 6. Marin Cilic (the only other player besides the 5 ahead of him to win a major, and he also finished runner-up 2 other times; I know his record against other top players is s**t but the fact that he's a slam winner puts him ahead of everyone else below) 7. David Ferrer (he was consistently the 5th best player in the world behind the big 4 for the first half of this decade before father time kicked in for the second half of the decade; never won a slam but he did make a finals and won a Masters title and was the most consistent player of his gen outside the big 4) 8. Tomas Berdych (he was a more dangerous version of Ferrer but simply couldn't cross the finish line with the big 3/4 always in the way) 9. Juan Martin Del Potro (his lone slam title came right before the turn of the decade and the damn injuries prevented him from being wayyyyyy higher on this list; he still managed to win a Masters title, make a slam final, claimed a couple OLY medals and when he was healthy, he always in the top 5/6) 10. Jo-Wilfred Tsonga (won a very impressive Masters title but never made a slam final in this decade. He was a stalwart in the top 10 for years though) HM: Thiem (made 2 RG finals and won a Masters but I put Dom below the players ranked 7-10 above since he was only a top player for the last 2-3 years or so) Zverev (he'd easily be on this list despite only being 22 at the end of the decade if his slam results weren't so pathetic) Dimitrov (won a couple big titles but was only a top 10 level player for like 1-2 seasons; he was not a factor in every other year) Raonic and Nishikori (when healthy they had some decent runs but as they both get near 30, they've yet to win a title above 500 level) Discuss Last edited: Sep 22, 2019 Reactions: OverallForm , McGradey , Flash O'Groove and 2 others ForumMember Hall of Fame Sep 21, 2019 #2 No Theim, Zverev, dimi and Medvedev ?

Expect him to be on the 2020s list though Medvedev became a top player only this season so he shouldn’t belong on this list either. Simialr to Zverev though, he’ll be on the 2020s list Dimitrov has been around the longest, but has he really been better than players like Ferrer, Tsonga, Berdych and Del Potro. Dimitrov never made a slam final while 3/4 players above did in this decade and the one that didn’t won an extremely impressive Masters title, while making it to a WTF finals but lost to Federer. All those above were top 5-10 staples for several years who regularly made it deep in majors, Masters, Olympics, and WTF’s just to get halted by the big 3/4 in their primes. Dimitrov has been a top 5-10 level player for only 1-2 years of his career Thiem was a tough one. He’s not very consistent but he’s already had a better career on clay then all those above, while winning an IW title to go along with it. He’s been a top 10 player since 2016 so he’s actually been elite more often than Dimitrov has been. I expect him to be on the 2020s list as well but its debatable as to whether he’s done enough to be on the 2010s list Reactions: Rosstour rUDin 21 Hall of Fame Sep 22, 2019 #10 For comparison 2000-2009 1.Federer(15 GS 4 YEC 16 MS 5 YE#1) 2.Nadal(6 GS 1 OG 15 MS 1 YE#1) 3.Agassi(3 GS 7 MS) 4.Hewitt(2 GS 2 YEC 2 MS 2 YE#1) 5.Kuerten(2 GS 1 YEC 3 MS 1 YE#1) 6.Safin(2 GS 5 MS) 7.Sampras(2 GS 1 MS) 8.Djokovic(1 GS 1 YEC 5 MS) 9.Roddick(1 GS 4 MS 1 YE#1) 10.Ferrero(1 GS 4 MS) Reactions: Rosstour aditya123 Hall of Fame Sep 22, 2019 #11 No point in creating this thread!!!!!!

I get it since Ferrer and Berdych played more consistent great years but that was due to Potro's injuries. MurraysMetalHip Hall of Fame Nov 10, 2019 #18 1. Murray 2. Del Pops 3. Stan 4. Nadal 5. Dan Evans 6. Norrie 7. Kyrgios 8. Tomic 9. Federer 10. Djokovic Reactions: Meles Tennisfan339 Professional Nov 10, 2019 #19 Interesting question (Thanks for bumping this thread, BTW) If this was about the 21st century, I'd say 1) Federer, 2) Nadal, 3) Djokovic, without hesitating. If this is about 2010/2019, then Djokovic definitely #1... He won 15 of his 16 GC and 4 of his 5 ATP Finals since 2010. #2 Nadal. He won more slams and more M1000 than Federer this decade. #3 is Federer of course. I agree #4 and #5 for Murray & Wawrinka. Both won 3 Slams, but Murray reached the 1° ranking and won a lot of M1000 - (Wawrinka didn't) What comes next is way more complicated, obviously,... I have to disagree partially with #6 to #10. I don't include Delpotro, Berdych and Tsonga. Delpotro won his only GS in 2009. Before 2010, therefore. He only reached one GS final and only won one M1000. Too many injuries and void years for him. Berdych only won 1 M1000 and it was way before 2010. Only 1 GS final. Tsonga won Paris and reached his only GS final in 2008. Best resulsts are A couple of GS semi finals. 1 M1000 (Toronto 2014)... do I include him? My #6 is definitely Cilic.  After D/N/F/M/W, he is the only player who won a Slam (USO 2014) He also won 1 M1000 (Cincinnati) and reached 2 other finals (Wim and AO). very regular and often played the WTA finals. #7 is Ferrer for me. Not much for his results, but for his regularity and his constant high ranking. He has been 5° (behind D/N/F/M) way more often than Wawrinka, though Wawrinka is still better thanks to his 3 GS. #8 is Zverev for me. His career is quite impressive for a 22 years old player. Ok, he has never shone in GS so far, but he won 3 M1000, reached 3 other M1000 finals and more impressive, he won the ATP finals last year (something players like Thiem, Berdych, Wawrinka, Ferrer, Delpotro have never accomplished.. How many players (outside D/F/N/M) have won 3 M1000 the the ATP finals, except Zverev? None. Davydenko and Roddick are the last ones, but that was before 2010. #9 is Thiem. One of the most regular players since 2016. He reached the FO open final 3 times, won 1 M1000 and multiple ATP500, reached the ATP finals for the 4th year in a row, and has quite an impressive H2H against D/N/F. #10 is difficult tho choose. I hesitate between the ones I didn't include (Delpotro, Berdych and Tsonga) but I can think of other players... Soderling, Dimitrov, Isner, Nishikori,... If I had to choose, one, it'd be Tsonga, for his regularity... Multiple SF in GS, 1 M000, 1 final in the ATP finals. In brief 1) DJokovic 2) Nadal 3) Federer 4) Murray 5) Wawrinka 6) Cilic 7) Ferrer 8) Zverev 9) Thiem 10) Tsonga.

Lost to peak Djokodal in 3 sets in IW and Shanghai finals in 2013, and match points against Djokovic also.  Zverev has 0 Slam SFs and won his Masters titles over Brokebackerer, Elbowovic and inconsistent Thiem.  His WTF win last year was his most impressive title but still Slams are the big league.  If Zverev had peak Djokodal like Del Potro, no way does he have 3 Masters titles.  I go with Del Potro over him.

His form may have been good but I doubt that 1 BP faced stat stands up against peak Djokodal on clay.  Del Potro, in comparison, beat Djokovic and Murray at IW and Nadal at Shanghai at their peaks in 2013 to make those Masters finals only to be stopped by Djokodal.  That Madrid title does not compare to that at all and I'm sure Del Potro would have loved to get a draw like that back then.

He won an IW title, made a GS finals, won an OLY silver and bronze, Davis Cup, and won 15 overall titles despite always being hurt for a long time (i.e. he won 2 CPOY awards within 5 years). Also, look how many times he played well in a big match against the big 3 despite losing (starting 2010): 2011 Wimbledon: played great but lost to Rafa 2011 Davis Cup: ditto Wimbledon 2012 French: lost a 5-setter against Fed after taking a 2-0 sets lead until that annoying fan re-charged Roger 2012 Olympics: lost 21-19 in the decided against Fed but beat Nole in the 3rd place game 2012 US Open: lost to Djokovic 2012 WTF: lost a 3-setter against Nole in the SF 2013 IW: took out Djokovic and Murray but lost to Rafa 2013 Wimbledon: GOATed but lost to Novak in a 5-set thriller 2013 Shanghai: destroyed Rafa but lost in a third set tiebreaker to Djokovic in the finale 2013 WTF: lost two tight 3-setters to Fedovic in RR 2016 Olympics: took out Djokodal but lost to a determined Murray 2016 Davis Cup: beat peak Murray and close to peak Cilic to win the DC for his nation 2017 US Open: Outlasted Thiem and Fed but lost to a GOATing Nadal 2017 Shanghai and Basel: lost in three sets to Fed in finals 2018 Wimbledon: lost a classic 5-setter to Rafa 2018 US Open: beat Rafa but got hurt in the finals vs Novak He's also lost tight matches against other tough opponents like a GOATing Isner at both 2013 Cincy and 2018 Miami, Berdych at the Madrid 2012, Wawrinka at the 2016 US Open. Now in terms of big wins: 2012 Olympics vs Djokovic 2012 and 2013 Basel vs Federer 2012 WTF vs Federer 2013 IW vs Djokovic 2013 WI vs Ferrer (He flat out murdered Daveed here) 2013 Shanghai vs Nadal 2016 Wimbledon vs Wawrinka 2016 Olympics vs Djokovic 2016 Olympics vs Nadal 2016 DC vs Murray 2016 DC vs Cilic 2017 US Open vs Federer 2018 IW vs Federer He also holds a positive H2H record vs everyone besides Roger, Rafa, Novak and Andy. Overall, none of these lost/next gen players have been able to reach the big three at big tourneys at as frequent of a rate as Del Potro has over the last 10-11 years, despite having both age and health on their side (two advantages Delpo didn't have as he faced a younger big 3 while always being plagued with health issues himself). Last edited: Nov 10, 2019 The Guru Legend Nov 10, 2019 #27 Putting Cilic at number 6 makes me highly uncomfortable but I guess he has to be there. I think all of the little 3 (Ferrer, Tsonga, Berdych) had better careers than Cilic but too many of their accomplishments came before 2010 I guess. Nishikori and Thiem are the only other players in contention for top 10 not in OPs list. I think I give Kei the nod for the number 10 spot. 1. Djokovic 2. Nadal 3. Federer 4. MuryGOAT 5. Wawrinka 6.

David Ferrer (he was consistently the 5th best player in the world behind the big 4 for the first half of this decade before father time kicked in for the second half of the decade; never won a slam but he did make a finals and won a Masters title and was the most consistent player of his gen outside the big 4) 8. Tomas Berdych (he was a more dangerous version of Ferrer but simply couldn't cross the finish line with the big 3/4 always in the way) 9. Juan Martin Del Potro (his lone slam title came right before the turn of the decade and the damn injuries prevented him from being wayyyyyy higher on this list; he still managed to win a Masters title, make a slam final, claimed a couple OLY medals and when he was healthy, he always in the top 5/6) 10. Jo-Wilfred Tsonga (won a very impressive Masters title but never made a slam final in this decade. He was a stalwart in the top 10 for years though) HM: Thiem (made 2 RG finals and won a Masters but I put Dom below the players ranked 7-10 above since he was only a top player for the last 2-3 years or so) Zverev (he'd easily be on this list despite only being 22 at the end of the decade if his slam results weren't so pathetic) Dimitrov (won a couple big titles but was only a top 10 level player for like 1-2 seasons; he was not a factor in every other year) Raonic and Nishikori (when healthy they had some decent runs but as they both get near 30, they've yet to win a title above 500 level) Discuss Click to expand... Predictable to the last, Thiemerev bettter than 6 to 10 save Delpo and really better than Delpozo who was injured the whole time. Meles Bionic Poster Nov 11, 2019 #36 Phoenix1983 said: This is a good correlation with the best players of the 2010s, I agree. However, Cilic has to be ranked 6th due to winning a slam during the decade. Click to expand... Cilic is a mug. mike danny Bionic Poster Nov 11, 2019 #37 Ok, I'll give my view: 1. Djokovic 2. Nadal 3. Federer 4. Murray 5. Stan This is the definitive top 5 that everyone agrees on. Now, for the rest if where the fun begins: 6. Cilic - he is the only other player besides the top 5 to win a slam and reach multiple slam finals. 7. Berdych - very consistent. Slam final + a multitude of other semis 8. Thiem - The only player after the top 6 to reach multiple slam finals in this decade. He is below Berdych because of being less consistent and not as good outside of clay as Tomas. 9. Ferrer - Slam final, several other slam semis and masters title. 10. Tsonga - Reached several slam semis, won a masters title and reached a WTF final. clout Hall of Fame Nov 11, 2019 #38 Meles said: Predictable to the last, Thiemerev bettter than 6 to 10 save Delpo and really better than Delpozo who was injured the whole time. Click to expand... It came down to Thiem and Tsonga for the 10th spot, but ultimately I went with Jo-Willy. Thiem will surely be on the 2020s list though. Zverev’s major record DQ’s him from this list imo, it’s beyond pathetic at this point. Flash O'Groove Hall of Fame Nov 11, 2019 #39 upchuck said: 1. Djokovic 2. Nadal 3. Federer 4. Murray 5. Wawrinka 6. Berdych 7. Ferrer 8. Cilic 9. Del Potro 10. Tsonga The hardest questions are: 1. How much weight to give Cilic's lone slam since otherwise he was clearly inferior to the other players in the bottom half of this list. 2. Where to put Del Potro who, when healthy, could challenge Murray for title of fourth best player of the era but who seemed to spend most the decade injured. 3. Who to put higher between Ferrer and Berdych. Thiem over Tsonga is preposterous. Click to expand... Cilic won his slam by beating direct contenders by beating Berdych in straight in the QF, then he gave himself to face a first time finalist by beating Federer in straigth in the SF; then took care of Nishikori in straight in the final. It's a fully legit victor, and a huge difference in comparison with whatever crumbles the other achieved. N01E Hall of Fame Nov 11, 2019 #40 1. Djokovic 2. Nadal 3. Federer 4. Murray 5. Wawrinka 6. Cilic 7. Zverev 8. Dimitrov 9. Medvedev 10. Del Potro UnderratedSlam G.O.A.T. Nov 11, 2019 #41 Seems like a reasonable ranking. I suppose Tsonga could move over for Zverev or Medvedev, but otherwise accurate. lud Hall of Fame Nov 11, 2019 #42 1. Djokovic - no brainer here. Most GS wins ,most GS Finals ,most M1000 and most weeks at No.1. Not to mention h2h. 2. Nadal - again no brainer. Interesting is while Djoker was dominanting figure,but h only win 2 more majors than Nadal in 2010-2019. 3. Federer - 5 GS + 5 Finals is great resume. 4. Murray - clearly 5. Wawrinka - talk about being clucth in Finals 6. Cilic - He truly should of win either Wim 2017 or AO 2018 7. Del Potro - Again,he may should be little lower. But hey he didn't play for 3-4 years and still won some great matches. 1 M1000 + 1 GS Finals + couple of more 1/2 Finals and 1/4 Final and most importantly 2 Olympics Medails and Davis Cup. 8. Thiem - this might be little be surprising,but I put him over any other slamless player. And he only played 3-4 great years. 2 Finals , 1 Masters + couple of more finals. He breats Big 3 more than any otehr player. He even bageled Djoker and Rafa. 9. Ferrer - consistent as hell. Lack of big titles is disapointing. 10. Zverev - hell,yeah I put him over Berdych any day. Bad GS results are pretty big disadventage,nut peaking at Masters is great plus. rUDin 21 Hall of Fame Nov 11, 2019 #43 megamind said: so I guess, Medvedev is now Number 9 in your ratings, maybe even Number 8 a week from now Click to expand...
