Visit Insider's homepage for more stories . Disney's live-action remake of "Mulan" is in theaters this July. The 1998 animated film follows Mulan as she disguises herself as a man to take the place of her father in an effort to defeat the Huns. The live-action adaption will be directed by Niki Caro ("The Zookeeper's Wife"). Though it will star Chinese actress Yifei Liu in the lead, the new movie will introduce a lot of characters. Before the film's release, get to know everyone who will star in the live-action "Mulan." Anjelica Oswald contributed to a previous version of this story. Chinese actress Liu Yifei, also known as Crystal Liu, is playing the titular heroine, Mulan. The actress is also a singer. She starred alongside Emile Hirsch in "The Chinese Widow." Walt Disney Studios and Stephen Tilley/Disney Enterprises, Inc. Fans were thrilled with her casting. According to The Hollywood Reporter, over 1,000 actresses were seen for the role across five different continents. This version of Mulan isn't just a warrior. She has an extraordinary, almost magical, power, which she's encouraged to hide in order to take her place in society. New Zealand actor Yoson An has been cast as Mulan's love interest named Honghui.

In the live-action film, Honghui comes from a military background and the two won't see eye to eye at first. Jet Li joined the cast as the emperor of China. Jet Li is a renowned martial artist. Walt Disney Studios/WDA According to Asia One , Li initially turned down the role in the film. He later agreed to it because his daughter told him he should be in a movie promoting Chinese culture.

John Phillips/Getty Images Tung is a no-nonsense commander, who acts as a father figure to Mulan while in war. Of course, he doesn't know her true identity. According to the film's production notes, Yen also joined the film after being "inspired" by his daughter. Another skilled martial artist, Yen shows off his sword skills in the film.

Tzi Ma will play Mulan's father. Tzi Ma was in "Arrival." Here he is above accepting his fate to go to war in "Mulan."

He's extremely supportive of his daughter and, when young, initially encourages her special gift. In the original movie, Mulan's father's name is Fa Zhou. Rosalind Chao was cast as Mulan's mother.
