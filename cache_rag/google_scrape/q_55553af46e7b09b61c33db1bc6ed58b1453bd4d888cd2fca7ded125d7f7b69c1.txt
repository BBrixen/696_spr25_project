Blackwell to Serve as Interim CEO of Foundation Partners Group June 10, 2024 President and CEO Kent Robertson has left Foundation Partners Group (Winter Park) and transitioned his responsibilities to Chris Blackwell, an advisor to Access Holdings. Blackwell will serve as interim CEO while the company searches for a new chief executive. Blackwell will be supported by Bob Bukala, former Foundation Partners CEO and current board member and advisor, as well as the company’s leadership team, which is made up of experienced business executives and veteran funeral service professionals. Robertson joined Foundation Partners in March 2020, and the company will always be grateful for his leadership, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when he led the company through some of the industry’s most challenging days. foundationpartners.com View News List | Search News In The News NFDA News Consumer News Supplier News Members in the News Death Notices NFDA Mission Statement The National Funeral Directors Association is the world’s leading, largest and most trusted association to support funeral professionals.
