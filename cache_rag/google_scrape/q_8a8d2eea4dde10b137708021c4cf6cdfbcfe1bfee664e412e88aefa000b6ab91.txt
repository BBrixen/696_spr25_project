Synopsis [ ] For decades, ex- United States Navy Office of Naval Intelligence officer Raymond Reddington (James Spader) has been one of the FBI 's most wanted fugitives. Brokering shadowy deals for criminals across the globe, Red was referred to by the media as “The Concierge of Crime.” Now, he's mysteriously surrendered to the FBI with an explosive offer: he will help catch a long thought dead terrorist, Ranko Zamani, under the condition that he speaks only to FBI special agent Elizabeth “Liz” Keen , an FBI profiler fresh out of Quantico. For Liz, it's going to be one hell of a ﬁrst day on the job. What follows is a twisting series of events as the race to stop a terrorist begins. What are Red's true intentions? Why has he chosen Liz, a woman with whom he seemingly has no connection? Does Liz have secrets of her own? Ranko Zamani , we come to ﬁnd out, is only the ﬁrst of many on The Blacklist : a list of politicians, mobsters, spies, and international terrorists. He will help catch them all... with the caveat that Liz continues to work as his partner. Red will teach Liz to think like a criminal and “see the bigger picture”... whether she wants to or not.
