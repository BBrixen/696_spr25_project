This article lists various career, tournament, and seasonal achievements by Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic . Djokovic has won an all-time record 24 Grand Slam singles titles . He has been the world No. 1 for a record total 428 weeks in a record 13 different years, [ 1 ] and the year-end world No. 1 a record eight times. Djokovic is the only man in tennis history to be the reigning champion of all four majors at once across all three different surfaces and the only one to achieve a triple Career Grand Slam by winning all four majors at least three times. He has won a record 72 Big Titles , winning all four Grand Slams tournaments, all nine ATP Masters tournaments, the Year-end Championships and Olympic Gold, completing both the Career Golden Slam and Career Super Slam . [ 2 ] Djokovic is widely regarded by sports analysts, tennis players and media pundits as the greatest tennis player of all time. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] In addition to his winning records at majors, Djokovic has reached 37 Grand Slam finals, playing at least seven finals at each major and winning at least 90 matches at each major, all of which are all-time records. He also had a record five different winning streaks of 26 or more matches at majors with 30 being the longest (2015–16), an Open Era record. Djokovic has won a record 40 ATP Masters titles. By 2018, he had won Masters titles across all nine tournaments, becoming the first and only player to achieve the Career Golden Masters . As a result, he is considered the most accomplished player in ATP Masters history for his versatility and success in winning Masters events on a consistent basis. [ 7 ] Moreover, Djokovic has won a record seven Year-end Championship titles, including a record streak of four titles from 2012 to 2015. Djokovic's 2011 season is considered one of the greatest seasons by a tennis player ever. Djokovic won 10 titles across all three different surfaces and defeated Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer a total of 10 times collectively with a match record of 10–1 against them. Djokovic went on a 41-match win streak and set a then-record of 5 Masters titles won in a season. In 2015 , Djokovic won three majors in a season for the second time, improved his record of most Masters won in a season by claiming six titles, and finished the year by winning his fourth consecutive Year-end Championships title. Djokovic also made the finals of all elite tournaments he played in 2015, winning a season-record 10 Big Titles across all surfaces and setting a rankings record of 16,950 points while defeating a record 31 Top-10 players in the season. Djokovic is unanimously regarded as the greatest hardcourt player ever. [ 8 ] He has won a record 50 Big Titles on hardcourts, including the most Majors, most Masters and most Year-end Championship titles. With his 7 Wimbledon titles, Djokovic is also regarded as one of the greatest players on grass courts in history. [ 9 ] Besides hard courts and grass courts, Djokovic has won 20 titles on clay, including three French Open titles, Olympic gold and 11 Masters titles, which is second only to Nadal's record of 26. Djokovic is one of three players, along with Robin Söderling and Alexander Zverev , to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros and the only one to do so twice. He is the only player to defeat Nadal in all three clay-court Masters events and the one who ended Nadal's consecutive run of 8 Monte Carlo titles in the 2013 final . Djokovic is the only player to win at least 3 majors across all three different surfaces (hard, clay and grass) and the only player to hold all major titles at once across the three surfaces. He is also the only player to win 6 Big Titles or more at one tournament on the three surfaces, the Australian Open being the most notable on hardcourts (outdoors), Wimbledon on grass, the Italian Open on clay, and the Year-end Championship on hardcourts (indoors). Djokovic holds the records for most victories against top 10 and top 5 players. Furthermore, he has won a record 61 titles by defeating multiple top 10 players and a record 24 titles by defeating multiple top 5 players en route. He has been part of the two most prolific rivalries in the Open Era, versus Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer , with him having a winning head-to-head record against them. He is the only player to defeat Nadal and Federer in all four Grand Slam tournaments, and the only one to defeat them at their most successful major tournament more than once. Djokovic has scored a record 21 or more victories against five different players; Nadal, Federer, Murray , Wawrinka and Berdych . In 2011, Djokovic had the most dominant record versus a world No. 1 during a single season, going 5–0 against Nadal before overtaking him as No. 1.
