As of December 2024, the Serbian had been world No. 1 in men’s tennis at various periods for a total of 428 weeks. What are the ATP World Rankings? The Pepperstone ATP Rankings, colloquially called the ‘world rankings’, are a historical objective merit-based method used for determining entry and seeding in all tournaments for both singles and doubles, according to the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). The ranking considers the results of the immediate past 52 weeks, with lists usually issued each Monday except during the duration of the four Grand Slam tournaments and the events in Miami and Indian Wells. The tournaments taken into account for the ranking are the four Grand Slam tournaments, the ATP World Tour Masters 1000, ATP 500, ATP 250, the Challenger and the futures tournaments. As of January 2025, Jannik Sinner occupied the top spot in the ATP rankings . How many men’s tennis players have been world number one? Since the ATP introduced its computerized ranking system in 1973, 29 men had been ranked as world number one as of December 2024. Roger Federer, who held the most Grand Slam titles at the time of his retirement from tennis, spent a total of 302 weeks over three separate periods at number one. Remarkably, one of these periods at the top of the ATP rankings lasted 237 weeks, which was the longest consecutive run as number one in the ATP rankings as of April 2025. Djokovic’s longest run, meanwhile, was 122 weeks.
