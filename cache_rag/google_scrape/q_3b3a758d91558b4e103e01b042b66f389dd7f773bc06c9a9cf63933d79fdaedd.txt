Members Online • [deleted] Why did Parasite win the Academy Award for Best Picture? Discussion Let me start off by saying that I’m not in the slightest bothered by it, just more curious. The Academy Awards are typically awarded to excellence in the American film industry. The Academy even has a category to recognize international films. Not only that, there are equally (if not more) prestigious international festivals/awards that are given, especially the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Personally, I think it’s great that a foreign language film did end up winning, as it provides additional exposure to Americans who tend to shy away from anything with subtitles. And even if Parasite was better then anything Hollywood put out that year (FYI, it also won the highest award at Cannes, the Palme d’Or) given that the Oscars are local awards, I’m still confused why it didn’t just win Best International film. Why do you think it won Best Picture? I’m sure there is a great reason for it, so apologies in advance for my ignorance on this topic. Please be respectful of your responses, as I’m trying to be as well with even posing this question. Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
