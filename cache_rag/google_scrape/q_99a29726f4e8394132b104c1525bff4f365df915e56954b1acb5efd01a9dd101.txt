By Tom Sweetman , CNN 5 minute read Updated           6:19 AM EDT, Wed October 28, 2015 Link Copied! Decmber 21, 2015 — FIFA president Joseph S. Blatter during a press conference he convened in response to the ban imposed by FIFA's Ethics Committee. The Swiss was sporting a band aid under his right eye -- thought to be because of a recent mole removal. Philipp Schmidli/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images December 21, 2015 — FIFA president Sepp Blatter and UEFA president Michel Platini are banned by FIFA's Ethics Committee for eight years. The ban relates to all football-related activity and is effective immediately. Shaun Botterill/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images/file November 11, 2015 — FIFA president Sepp Blatter had been in hospital in November, recovering from "a body breakdown." November 9, 2015 — Wolfgang Niersbach announces his resignation as German Football Federation president, taking "political responsibility" for accusations of bribery involving the country's bid to stage the 2006 World Cup. Thomas Lohnes/Bongarts/Bongarts/Getty Images October 26, 2015 — FIFA's deadline for submitting candidacies for its presidential election was October 26, with eight putting themselves forward for the February 26, 2015 vote to succeed Sepp Blatter. However, on October 28 David Nakhid was omitted from FIFA's final list as one of the five football associations that had declared its support for him had already done so for another candidate. FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/AFP/Getty Images October 26, 2015 — UEFA president Michel Platini was the first to enter the FIFA presidential race back in July, but questions remain over whether he is even still eligible to stand in the election after he was provisionally banned from football for 90 days. VALERY HACHE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images October 26, 2015 — Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein of Jordan announced his presidency bid in September. He was the sole challenger to Sepp Blatter in the May 29 election but conceded defeat after receiving 73 votes to the Swiss' 133 in the first round of voting. Dave Thompson/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images October 26, 2015 — Ex-Trinidad and Tobago captain David Nakhid submitted his candidacy earlier this month. Nakhid also played for the likes of PAOK of Greece and Malmo of Sweden. However, on October 28, Nakhid was omitted from FIFA's final list. "One of the five declarations of support for Mr Nakhid was declared invalid as the same member association had previously issued a declaration of support for another candidate," said a FIFA statement. "In view of this, the Ad-hoc Electoral Committee decided not to consider Mr Nakhid's application as it did not fulfil the required five declarations of support." -/AFP/AFP/Getty Images October 26, 2015 — South African businessman Tokyo Sexwale, who has been part of FIFA's anti-discrimination taskforce, announced his intention to run for presidency after the South African Football Association's National Executive Committee unanimously endorsed his candidacy last week. JACK GUEZ/AFP/AFP/Getty Images October 26, 2015 — Former FIFA international relations director Jerome Champagne, who had hoped to challenge Blatter in May's election but was forced to withdraw, confirmed last week that he will be standing. Adrian Dennis/Getty Images October 26, 2015 — Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al-Khalifa launched his bid to become the next FIFA president 24 hours before the deadline.  Sheikh Salman has been criticized by human rights organizations after being accused of complicity in crimes against humanity. Sheikh Salman's representatives were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNN. Stanley Chou/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images October 26, 2015 — UEFA announced on the day of the deadline that its general secretary Gianni Infantino -- Platini's right-hand man -- will run for the FIFA presidency. ALAIN GROSCLAUDE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images October 26, 2015 — Liberian Football Association president Musa Bility also confirmed on the day of the deadline that he is to run for the FIFA presidency. ZOOM DOSSO/AFP/AFP/Getty Images October 8, 2015 — Has FIFA president Blatter spent his last day as head of football's world governing body? The 79-year-old Swiss was provisionally banned for 90 days Thursday by the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA's Ethics Committee, though the duration of the ban could be extended by 45 days. Alessandro Della Bella/Getty Images/FILE October 8, 2015 — UEFA president and FIFA vice-president Platini was also provisionally banned for 90 days. Platini is one of the FIFA presidential candidates hoping to succeed Blatter. AFP/Getty Images October 8, 2015 — South Korean billionaire and FIFA presidential candidate Chung Mong-joon was banned for six years and fined $103,000 based on findings relating to the bidding process for the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 tournament in Qatar. Chung, a former FIFA vice president, vociferously denies any wrongdoing and attacked his colleagues for leaks that he says are designed to hurt his candidacy. Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images October 8, 2015 — FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke was suspended for 90 days. Lars Baron/Bongarts/Getty Images/file September 14, 2015 — U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announces that 'additional charges against individuals and entities' are likely following the assessment of new evidence. Ramin Talaie/Getty Images September 9, 2015 — Prince Ali adds his name to the list of candidates seeking to replace Sepp Blatter. The election at scandal-hit FIFA is on February 26, 2016. PAUL ELLIS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images July 30, 2015 — South Korean billionaire and former FIFA vice president Chung announces his intention to run for the top job in world soccer. Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images July 29, 2015 — European football chief Platini, seen here with Blatter (left), is the leading candidate to replace the outgoing president. The former France captain is also a vice-president in FIFA's Executive Committee. Michael Buholzer/AFP/Getty Images May 14, 2010 — A turbulent period for FIFA began in May 2010 when the world's governing body for soccer was presented with official bid documents by Australia, England, Netherlands/Belgium, Japan, South Korea, Qatar, Russia, Spain/Portugal and the United States for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. During the ceremony at its Swiss headquarters, FIFA announced dates for inspections of the bidding nations from July-September. Getty Images May 16, 2010 — British newspaper Mail On Sunday reveals that English bid leader David Triesman (pictured here with soccer star David Beckham) was secretly recorded making comments about alleged attempts by Spain and Russia to bribe referees at the imminent 2010 FIFA World Cup. Getty Images November 18, 2010 — FIFA's Ethics Committee confirms the suspension of six FIFA officials including executive committee members Amos Adamu (pictured) and Reynald Temarii, after claims by Britain's Sunday Times newspaper that they offered to sell their World Cup votes. Adamu receives a three-year ban and $11,947 fine and Temarii a 12-month ban and a $5,973 fine. The committee also rules that there is no evidence to support allegations of collusion between rival bid teams. Both Adamu and Temarii appeal unsuccessfully to FIFA's Appeal Committee and Adamu later also files an unsuccessful appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). In May 2015, FIFA bans Temarii for another eight years for allegedly accepting money from former Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed Bin Hammam to cover legal costs of his appeal of FIFA's 2010 ban. Getty Images November 29, 2010 — Issa Hayatou from Cameroon (pictured) is one of three FIFA officials -- the others Nicolas Leoz from Paraguay and Ricardo Teixeira from Brazil -- who are named in a BBC program which alleges they took bribes from the International Sports and Leisure (ISL) marketing company who secured World Cup rights in the 1990s. A day later, Hayatou says he is considering legal action against the BBC. All three would have voted on the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The International Olympic Committee's Ethics Commission later looks into the claims against Hayatou -- as he was an IOC member. It finds he had personally received a sum of money from ISL as a donation to finance the African Football Confederation (CAF)'s 40th anniversary and recommends he be reprimanded. In 2013, an internal investigation finds Leoz and Teixeira accepted illegal payments from ISL but says the acceptance of bribe money was not punishable under Swiss law at the time. Its report says that as both have resigned their positions with FIFA further steps over "the morally and ethically reproachable conduct of both persons" are superfluous. Fethi Belaid/AFP/Getty December 2, 2010 — The winning bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup finals are announced. Russia wins the bid to host the 2018 tournament. But the big shock came when Blatter announced that Qatar would host the 2022 finals, despite FIFA's bid inspection report stating that hosting the World Cup in June and July would be "considered as a potential health risk for players, officials, the FIFA family and spectators, and requires precautions to be taken." Getty Images May 10, 2011 — Just a few weeks before FIFA's presidential vote, former English Football Association chairman David Triesman testifies at a UK parliamentary enquiry into England's failed 2018 bid. Under the cover of parliamentary privilege, Triesman accuses FIFA Executive Committee members Warner, Leoz, Teixeira and Worawi Makudi of trying to secure cash and privileges in return for their vote. In other evidence submitted to the committee from the Sunday Times, it was alleged that FIFA vice-president Hayatou along with fellow Executive Committee member Jacques Anouma has been paid $1.5 million to vote for Qatar as the 2022 World Cup host. All those accused, and the Qatar Football Association, strenuously deny the allegations. Getty Images May 26, 2011 — FIFA announces it will investigate Warner (pictured), who ran the CONCACAF federation covering Central and North America, and Mohamed Bin Hammam, head of the Asian Football Confederation, over bribery allegations. It follows a report by fellow Executive Committee member Chuck Blazer alleging that they paid $40,000 worth of bribes to secure the support of members of the Caribbean Football Union.  They deny the claims, with Warner promising a "tsunami" of revelations to clear his name. Bin Hammam claims the accusations are part of a plan to force him to withdraw as a candidate for FIFA's presidency. He is incumbent Blatter's only opponent in FIFA's presidential election due to be held June 1. Luis Acosta/AFP/Getty May 27, 2011 — FIFA says it will expand its corruption probe to include Blatter, after Bin Hammam claimed Blatter knew about cash payments he was accused of giving to national football association in exchange for pro-Hammam votes during Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid. Blatter maintains that the allegations are "without substance," and two days later is exonerated by FIFA's Ethics Committee. Getty Images May 29, 2011 — But FIFA's Ethics Committee upholds the complaints against Bin Hammam (pictured) and Warner. Bin Hammam is effectively barred from standing in the FIFA leadership election. Warner's tsunami turns out to be an email, where secretary general Valcke seems to suggest that Qatar "bought" the right to host the 2022 World Cup. After initially threatening legal action, Qatar withdraws its complaint when Valcke explains he was referring to Qatar's large, and legal, campaign budget, rather than bribes. Warner faces no further action following his resignation and the presumption of innocence remains. Getty Images June 1, 2011 — Despite a last minute attempt by the English FA to postpone the vote -- a proposal which garnered just 17 out of the available 208 votes -- Blatter is re-elected for a fourth term as president of FIFA at the 61st FIFA Congress at Hallenstadion in Zurich. He vows to learn from past mistakes and undertake a reform agenda. Getty Images July 23, 2011 — Bin Hammam is banned for life by FIFA after a two-day hearing into bribery allegations. The ban is annulled a year later due to lack of evidence. October 21, 2011 — Blatter announces the introduction of four new task forces and a "Committee of Good Governance" aimed at reforming the organization and repairing its reputation. Getty Images March 30, 2012 — FIFA announces its executive committee has approved proposed changes to its Ethics Committee , splitting it into two entities -- one to investigate allegations and another to rule on them. It follows a report by the Independent Governance Committee (IGC) commissioned after Bin Hammam's ban, that found FIFA's past handling of corruption scandals had been "unsatisfactory." Getty Images April 24, 2012 — The Council of Europe, a watchdog that oversees the European Court of Human Rights, criticizes Blatter in a damning report into FIFA's handling of bribery allegations . The report says it would be "difficult to imagine" that the FIFA president would have been unaware of "significant sums" paid to unnamed FIFA officials by sports marketing company International Sports and Leisure (ISL) in connection with lucrative contracts for World Cup television rights. However it makes no allegations that he had any involvement in corruption. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty July 17, 2012 — Blatter announces that former U.S. attorney Michael J Garcia and German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert (pictured) have joined FIFA to probe allegations of wrongdoing. Their first task will be to investigate a Swiss court document after an investigation into alleged illegal payments made by FIFA marketing partner ISL to former FIFA president Joao Havelange and former executive committee member Teixeira. However, they will also investigate old cases -- including the process surrounding the decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar. Meantime, Bin Hamman is again suspended over new corruption allegations by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), which he used to lead. Bin Hammam says he is innocent but in December 2012 he resigns all his football positions after a FIFA report finds him guilty of violating the conflict of interest clauses in its Code of Ethics and bans him from all football-related activity for life. Sebastien Bozon/AFP/Getty December 17, 2012 — President of the South African Football Association (SAFA) Kirsten Nematandani (pictured) and four other SAFA officials are suspended as an act of "good governance" following a report by FIFA, which adjudged four friendly matches ahead of Africa's first World Cup in 2010 had been fixed. SAFA later decides FIFA went beyond its mandate in suspending them before its investigation had concluded and reinstates the officials to their posts. In May 2015, Nematandani tells South African broadcaster ANN7 he has yet to hear from FIFA in relation to the investigation. "This is about my reputation," he says. "My name has to be cleared." Lee Warren/Gallo Images/Getty January 9, 2013 — FIFA imposes a worldwide lifetime ban from football on 41 players from Korea who became embroiled in match-fixing activities in their domestic league, extending a ban handed down by the Korea Football Association (KFA) in 2011. The charges relate to alleged match-fixing in Korea's domestic K-League competition. All but one case were centered on offering or accepting bribes to throw matches. Doug Pensinger/Getty February 4, 2014 — A report by police agency Europol reveals that 380 matches across Europe have been fixed by an Asia-based crime syndicate, including World Cup and European Championship qualifiers as well as the continent's top club competitions. Scores of people have been arrested across 15 countries, it says. FIFA vows to act on the revelations, but says it will need help from outside agencies to eradicate match-fixing. Stuart Franklin/Bongarts/Getty March 11, 2013 — FIFA says executive committee member Vernon Manilal Fernando of Sri Lanka has been suspended at the request of Garcia and Eckert, co-chairs of the investigatory and adjudicatory bodies of the Ethics Committee respectively. No details of his alleged transgression were released, but FIFA said the decision was based on alleged violations of  its Code of Ethics, including conflicts of interest, offering and accepting bribes, bribery and corruption, "in order to prevent the interference with the establishment of the truth with respect to proceedings now in the adjudicatory chamber." He is later given a lifetime ban , which he unsuccessfully appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Harold Cunningham/Getty Images/file April 30, 2013 — An internal investigation by FIFA's Ethics Committee clears Blatter of misconduct in the bribery scandal, but his predecessor, Brazilian Havelange, resigns as honorary president for his part in the scandal. Havelange and former executive committee members Teixeira and Leoz were all found to have accepted illegal payments from former marketing partner International Sports and Leisure (ISL) between 1992 and 2000. Gary M Prior/Allsport May 6, 2013 — FIFA's Ethics Committee suspends outgoing executive committee member Blazer (pictured back right) for 90 days "based on the fact that various breaches of the Code of Ethics appear to have been committed" by the American. Blazer is former general secretary of CONCACAF, the body which governs football in North and Central America and the Caribbean, and his suspension follows a report by its integrity committee. Blazer denies any wrongdoing. Julian Finney/Getty June 13, 2014 — German footballer Franz Beckenbauer, the only man to win the World Cup as captain and coach, is provisionally suspended from any football-related activity for 90 days for failing to cooperate with a FIFA corruption investigation. FIFA says Beckenbauer had been asked to help with its Ethics Committee's probe into allegations against Qatar 2022 and the World Cup bidding process. Beckenbauer tells German media that he did not respond to questions by the chairman of the Ethics Committee's investigatory body because they were in English and he did not understand them. Lennart Preiss/Bongarts/Getty Eckert (pictured), chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA's Ethics Committee, releases a summary of the committee's investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup. The summary, by Eckert, says Qatar and Russia were not guilty of any alleged corruption, clearing them of wrongdoing. Garcia, the author of the full report, and chairman of the Ethics Committee's investigatory body, wanted the report to be published in full. Garcia says the summary contains "incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions detailed in the investigatory chamber's report." Leonhardt/AFP/Getty November 18, 2014 — FIFA lodges a criminal complaint with the Swiss judiciary relating to the "international transfers of assets with connections to Switzerland, which merit examination by the criminal prosecution authorities." Philipp Schmidli/Getty Image December 17, 2014 — Garcia resigns as chairman of the investigatory body of the Ethics Committee, following FIFA's decision to throw out his appeal after he complained about the way his report into the World Cup bidding process had been summarized by Eckert. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty December 19, 2014 — FIFA decides to publish a redacted version of Garcia's investigative report into alleged corruption surrounding the bidding process for the tournaments. The decision was unanimously endorsed by FIFA's 25-person executive committee. FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images/file May 27, 2015 — At the request of U.S. officials, Swiss authorities raid FIFA's headquarters in Zurich and arrest seven people. Meantime, the U.S. Department of Justice announces the unsealing of a 47-count indictment detailing charges against 14 people for racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. They include FIFA officials accused of taking bribes totaling more than $150 million and in return provided "lucrative media and marketing rights" to soccer tournaments as kickbacks over the past 24 years. Separately Switzerland announces its own investigation into the awarding of the World Cup bids to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty FIFA corruption scandal timeline Prev Next Editor’s Note: This article was first published on October 27, 2015 listing David Nakhid as one of the candidates who would stand in the FIFA presidential election. On October 28, 2015, FIFA issued a statement explaining that Nakhid would not be running in the election as one of the five football associations that had declared its support for him had already done so for another candidate. Story highlights Deadline for submitting candidacies for FIFA election has passed FIFA presidential election will take place on February 26, 2015 Candidates are vying to succeed Sepp Blatter, who resigned in June CNN — One can’t campaign, another presented South Africa’s version of “The Apprentice” and a third candidate is denying allegations of human rights abuses. Welcome to the 2016 FIFA presidential elections – a ballot designed to clean up soccer. The eight-man shortlist of candidates to replace outgoing president Sepp Blatter is now complete and the campaigning can begin in earnest ahead of the final vote on February 26. It’s been a turbulent year for world football’s governing body. Blatter was re-elected for a fifth term as FIFA chief back in May, but following a corruption scandal that rocked the organization, the Swiss resigned from his role just four days later. So a second election in as many years was called and the deadline for submitting candidacies – plus the five nominations required from member federations – expired Monday. Here are eight candidates vying to succeed Blatter – who was provisionally banned from football for 90 days by FIFA’s Ethics Committee in the wake of a Swiss criminal investigation. Michel Platini UEFA president Michel Platini was the first to enter the FIFA presidential race back in July and up until last month was the favorite to succeed Blatter. Now, however, questions remain over whether he is even still eligible to stand after he was banned alongside Blatter, pending a disciplinary hearing, amid an investigation into a “disloyal” $2 million payment he received from Blatter for work allegedly carried out between 1999 and 2002. UEFA Executive Committee stands behind Michel Platini http://t.co/n221bcgq74 — UEFA (@UEFA) October 8, 2015 “I reject all of the allegations that have been made against me, which are based on mere semblances and are astonishingly vague,” said Platini, who has appealed the ban and is awaiting the verdict of the FIFA Appeals Committee If his suspension, which is due to expire in the first week of January, is lifted before the February election then he may be able to rejoin the race. Platini, one of the finest players of his generation, captained France to European Championship glory in 1984, while he won the European Cup and two Italian Serie A titles with Juventus. He has served as the head of European football since 2007. Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein of Jordan was next to announce his presidency bid in September . A FIFA vice-president, he was the sole challenger to Blatter in the May 29 election but conceded defeat after receiving 73 votes to the Swiss’ 133 in the first round of voting. Prince Ali, son of the late King Hussein of Jordan, is head of Jordan’s football association as well as the West Asian Football Federation. “For men and women, players and referees, administrators and fans [football] is hope, it is unity,” he said upon announcing his bid. “It is a powerful tool to make the world a better place.” I ask you to support me in my campaign to bring Hope, Dignity, Excellence &  Opportunity back to football, the greatest sport on earth. — Ali Al Hussein (@AliBinAlHussein) September 9, 2015 David Nakhid Ex-Trinidad and Tobago captain David Nakhid submitted his candidacy earlier this month. Nakhid, who currently runs the David Nakhid Inernational Football Academy, also played for the likes of PAOK of Greece and Malmo of Sweden. “What we need to do is make a serious investment in our potential by bringing the correct leadership regionally and globally to take the Caribbean forward,” he is quoted as saying . “We need to shift the paradigm, shift FIFA away from that Euro-centric look and bring the Caribbean to the table.” However in a statement issued Wednesday, FIFA explained that Nakhid had been omitted from the final list of candidates. According to FIFA, one of five football associations that declared its support for Nakhid had already done so for another candidate. Tokyo Sexwale South African businessman Tokyo Sexwale, a former political prisoner and friend of the late Nelson Mandela, announced his intention to run for presidency after the South African Football Association’s National Executive Committee unanimously endorsed his candidacy last week. Sexwale has been part of FIFA’s anti-discrimination taskforce and has worked on helping foster a relationship between the football associations of Israel and Palestine, while he also served on the organizing committee for South Africa’s 2010 World Cup. Away from football, Sexwale has presented the South African version of the hit TV show “The Apprentice.” Jerome Champagne Former FIFA international relations director Jerome Champagne also confirmed last week that he will be standing in the election. He had hoped to challenge Blatter in May’s election but was forced to withdraw after he failed to acquire the five nominations needed to stand. The former French diplomat’s manifesto includes plans to modernize how FIFA is run, cut European places at FIFA as well as the World Cup, while trialling the use of video reviews to help referees. “Despite the disappointment, I do not feel any bitterness because I know how the pyramidal structure of football works,” Champagne said after his withdrawal earlier this year . “They feared reprisals from their confederations having issued recommendations.” I am candidate to the FIFA presidency - https://t.co/EwgNln48Eo pic.twitter.com/4acGAlT3bC — Jérôme Champagne (@JChampagne2016) October 23, 2015 Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al-Khalifa Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al-Khalifa launched his bid to become the next FIFA president 24 hours before the deadline. A member of the Bahraini Royal Family, Sheikh Salman has been criticized by human rights organizations after being accused of complicity in crimes against humanity. He allegedly headed a committee which identified 150 athletes involved in pro-democracy demonstrations in 2011, many of whom were later imprisoned and tortured. Sheikh Salman’s representatives were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNN, although he has labeled these allegations as “nasty lies” in an interview given to the BBC. Gianni Infantino UEFA announced on the day of the deadline that its general secretary Gianni Infantino – Platini’s right-hand man – will run for the FIFA presidency. The governing body’s executive committee held a meeting Monday at which it agreed to support Infantino as a candidate. The Swiss, a multilingual lawyer, has worked at UEFA since 2000 and took up his role as general secretary in 2009. “We believe that Gianni Infantino has all of the qualities required‎ to tackle the major challenges ahead and to lead the organisation on a path of reform to restore FIFA’s integrity and credibility,” a UEFA statement read . UEFA Executive Committee supports UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino for FIFA presidency. https://t.co/gaWYToJbyH — Pedro Pinto (@PedroPintoComms) October 26, 2015 According to reports, Infantino will drop out of the race if Platini is cleared by the FIFA Appeals Committee. Musa Bility Liberian Football Association president Musa Bility also confirmed on the day of the deadline that he is to run for the FIFA presidency. Bility has endured a difficult relationship with the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in recent years, taking a case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over changes to the way CAF elects its president. “If we are to change football, then we have to make sure that those who have been running FIFA for the last 20-25 years have nothing to do with it,” Bility said after announcing his candidacy .
