God of War won Game of the Year 2018.  This subreddit is dedicated to discussion of the games and sharing news about them. Or posting anything related to GOW really. Members Online • Life_Offer9796 Why is God of War 2018's sales drastically higher than any other in the franchise? Discussion As seen in the picture, GoW 2018's 20 million sales is almost 4 times of the 2nd highest sales GoW game which is GoW3. What are the major factors of such great difference? In addition, does it mean that GoW 2018 is much better than GoW3?(Please don't be defensive towards this question as I don't know the franchise and am just throwing out a hypothesis) Edit: Thanks for the answers. Although one factor that is overlooked, and I think is also the biggest factor in contributing to this 4 times difference is the growth of the gaming market. All the other factors just seem to be minor factors in comparison to the folded size of gamer population. Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
