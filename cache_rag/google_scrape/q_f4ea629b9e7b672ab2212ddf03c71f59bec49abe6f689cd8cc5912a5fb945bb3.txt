What will happen to D3 after D4 is released - General Discussion - Diablo 3 Forums Diablo 3 Forums What will happen to D3 after D4 is released General Discussion Scorp-1728 February 3, 2023,  7:39pm 1 was really curious about this since I haven’t bought D4 and probably (99% sure) won’t be getting it so I wanted to know what the devs have planned for D3.  I know that the d3 and d4 teams are completely separate so the only reason I’d see them stop focusing on d3 is to save on resources. I been trying to find substantial info about this but haven’t been able to 1 Like Indian-2161 February 3, 2023,  7:43pm 2 No one knows. But i would not bury D3. You can play both, probably people will go back and forth between sesons. Some people will shurely stay. And some will decide they like D3 better and eventualy come back. Though i would not expect any big updates. 6 Likes Travar-1656 February 3, 2023,  7:51pm 3 It will stay as is now more or less… maybe some new perks for each season and that is it. It had a glorious run… too bad they removed AH 1 Like Shawmeck-1626 February 3, 2023,  7:58pm 4 You are not alone.  Many people think and feel the same way you do about both d3 and d4. I am happy to know there are players who will find joy playing D4, but its not a game for me.  If they stop supporting D3 or d2r then thats an outline for all future diablo content.  I would ask myself, is it worth investing my time and energy in a copany that abandons its customers? Minkles-1974 February 3, 2023,  8:07pm 5 You’re so gonna buy D4, 99% my a$$ 1 Like Seiya-1765 February 3, 2023,  8:29pm 6 I know I am not going to.  I was in the closed beta and I was not as impressed as other people. That said, D3 IS and HAS BEEN in maintenance mode for several YEARS now.  It will likely still have seasons done.  How often and what types, who knows. I would bet that at the worst, they set up a rotation of seasons from what we have had.  I know I would look forward to ethereal weapons again. What could be the best, or worst, is if they made it so you could make custom pseudo-seasons where you could do what you wanted, even stacking them.  Likely-hood, I would say 0%. Regardless, more will be done with the game as that is what they do with games in maint mode. 3 Likes Krastifari-2430 February 3, 2023,  8:40pm 7 I’m really going to miss D3 sob sob DeadlyMouse-1231549 February 3, 2023, 10:57pm 8 https://media.tenor.com/pr3QtBlw40AAAAAd/top-men-indiana-jones.gif Avalon-11311 February 3, 2023, 11:21pm 9 How many people who were venting about D($) in 2018 are now playing it in 2023? How many people who say they will not play D4 will in fact be playing D4? Only Bobby Kotick’s accountants will know for sure. As for D3 it will most likely still be a round Just like D2 is. Some people like the mindless paragon tread mill and being on the cheater boards. 2 Likes RATEZ-1199 February 3, 2023, 11:25pm 10 Only time will tell!!! Scorp-1728 February 3, 2023, 11:55pm 11 Shawmeck: ame way you do about both d3 and d4. I am happy to know there are players who will find joy playing D4, but its not a game for me. If they stop supporting D3 or d2r then thats an outline for all future diablo content. I would ask myself, is it worth investing my time and energy in a copany that abandons its customers? well believe what you want but I’m not paying $100 CAD for the base game.  I also haven’t bought an Acti-Blizz game since WoW SL Oblivion-1520 February 4, 2023, 12:10am 12 My guess is that D3 will continue to receive updates and season themes down the line. However as time passes, the updates may lessen to the point of near-scarcity, and seasons may instead recycle through previous seasonal themes rather than bringing out new ones. 1 Like Shivan-11800 February 4, 2023,  3:54am 13 Scorp: I been trying to find substantial info about this but haven’t been able to Relax, you answer is in this (original D2) that is still on server with Seasons still. D3 will be live for many years to come as long as the electric grid is live. The reason there’s no one officially saying this is because it’s not necessary. 1 Like Kilometer-11340 February 4, 2023,  5:37am 14 Just like every Blizzard game in maintenance. Minimal support until D3R. Unleashed-22344 February 4, 2023,  9:47am 15 Yeah, but they are just resetting the seasons. With D3 there has been some kind of changes evey season - however good/bad they may have been. CroDanZ-2156 February 4, 2023, 12:27pm 16 it will probably go in maintanace mode… Maybe they even continue to release new seasons but overall with minor balance changes and minimal support. The Season 28 patch is practicaly like the Patch 1.14d in D2 LOD back in the days. 1 Like Kush-1975 February 4, 2023,  7:19pm 17 Its a shame.  No more item trading.  An AH.  Since the 90s players dreamed of legitimate means to trade an possibly sell a rare item.   Now you have to find your own.  An grind re rolling stats with the enchantress.  I am not knocking the game, but the option for AH should be there.  I put in about 1000 hours, most of which was at release.  I bought the game thinking every item in it would be tradable at the AH, it was on the box.   Just because they had a group of people duping items with their roll back, an presumably a unknown warning from the sec they removed the best thing about the game.  I know the drop rate was abysmal in the beginning.  Now, you get drops, but you still never get the perfect roll or even can do that with enchanting it.  What about the people that don’t want to do 100 andarial runs for 1 ring.  Its not the end of the world if the AH existed.  And heck, theres nothing like finding a good item for a class you don’t play an listing it.  Hearing that zzzzzzzzing right after you listed it, you knew it was to low.  Removing the AH avoided what they got when they first adjusted the game too…player backlash.  I guess it should have come with a warning…about updates.  I still miss it.  Looking back, it should not have been removed.  Jmo.  Fixing loot an finding ones own items is entirely possible.  They did a pretty good job.  I can’t add a socket to legacy items, which, why not.  They are already under powered. Who knows what will happen with d3.  Probably enough support to “keep it running” while we move to d4. Kargon-2720 February 4, 2023,  7:24pm 18 Kush: Now, you get drops, but you still never get the perfect roll or even can do that with enchanting it. But you expect other people will get those perfect items, and instead of using them themselves will sell it? 1 Like Unsanety-1456 February 5, 2023,  2:09am 19 Shivan: D3 will be live for many years to come as long as the electric grid is live. Stupid zombie apocalypse. FrodoFragins-1142 February 5, 2023,  3:17am 20 There’s no reason for them not to at put some past seasonal themes into a rotation.  I’d expect them to stop making new cosmetic rewards for the season journey though.  And if we’re lucky maybe they’ll let someone adjust the numbers on a couple of low performing sets each season. next page → Home Categories Guidelines Terms of Service Privacy Policy Powered by Discourse , best viewed with JavaScript enabled
