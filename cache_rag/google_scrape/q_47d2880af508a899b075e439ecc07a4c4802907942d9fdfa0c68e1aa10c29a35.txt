Please let us know if you have feedback . The last day of November will mark one year since the debut of ChatGPT, a tool that has helped define the public understanding of generative AI. Analysts and executives characterize generative AI as the biggest technological advancement since the internet, both in interest levels and its ability to disrupt the way work gets done . CIOs went from talking about generative AI once or twice a year to the technology dominating conversations in the boardroom, with C-suite members and at the proverbial watercooler.
