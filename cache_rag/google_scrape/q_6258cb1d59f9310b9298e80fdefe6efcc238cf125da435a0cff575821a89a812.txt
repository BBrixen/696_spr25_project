Catherine Shoard Sun 26 Feb 2017 23.57 EST Last modified on Thu 22 Feb 2018 15.49 EST Share Emma Stone has won the best actress Oscar for her role in La La Land, the all-singing and dancing hymn to Hollywood directed by Damien Chazelle. The victory follows wins for Stone in the same category at the Baftas a fortnight ago, the Screen Actors Guild Awards two weeks before that and in the comedy or musical category at the Golden Globes in January. Stone, 28, beat Isabelle Huppert (for Elle), Natalie Portman (for Jackie), Ruth Negga (for Loving) and Meryl Streep (for Florence Foster Jenkins) to the award. It was her second Oscar nomination, following a best supporting actress nod for Birdman in 2015. La La Land had been the runaway sensation of this season, Oscar-tipped ever since its premiere on the opening night of the Venice film festival in August, although Moonlight won the best picture award.
