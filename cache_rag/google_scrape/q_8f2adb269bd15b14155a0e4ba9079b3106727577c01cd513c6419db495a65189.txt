[ 27 ] In May 2017, it was announced that Jimmy Kimmel would return as host for a second consecutive year. [ 28 ] Kimmel expressed that he was thrilled to be selected to MC the gala again, commenting, "Hosting the Oscars was a highlight of my career and I am grateful to Cheryl [Boone Isaacs], Dawn [Hudson], and the Academy for asking me to return to work with two of my favorite people, Mike De Luca and Jennifer Todd. If you think we screwed up the ending this year, wait until you see what we have planned for the 90th anniversary show!" [ 29 ] On December 4, 2017, it was announced that the timing of the ceremony and its pre-show had been changed and both would be scheduled to broadcast a half-hour earlier than prior telecasts. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] In the first half of the nominations announcement, pre-taped category introductions were included that featured actresses Priyanka Chopra , Rosario Dawson , Gal Gadot , Salma Hayek , Michelle Rodriguez , Zoe Saldana , Molly Shannon , Rebel Wilson and Michelle Yeoh . [ 32 ] [ 33 ] As per the tradition of the Academy, the previous year's Best Actor winner usually presents the Best Actress award for the next year's ceremony; in lieu of this, the previous year's Best Actor winner Casey Affleck reportedly decided not to attend the ceremony due to his sexual harassment accusations ; [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Jodie Foster and Jennifer Lawrence presented the award together in his place. [ 36 ] The Best Actor award was presented by Jane Fonda and Helen Mirren. [ 37 ] Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway returned to present the Best Picture Award for the second year in the row, after the previous year's announcement error . [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Sixth-year in a row Derek McLane designed the stage with forty-five million Swarovski crystals . [ 40 ] [ 41 ] ABC scheduled a late-night "sneak peak" of its new talk show The Alec Baldwin Show after the ceremony and late local newscasts. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] In a comedic acknowledgement of the length of the ceremony and acceptance speeches in particular, Kimmel announced that the winner with the shortest acceptance speech would receive a new jet ski (presented game show -style with Helen Mirren as a model). The shortest speech would be given by Mark Bridges for his Best Costume Design win.

Frances McDormand's Oscar theft [ ] Right after her win at the Governor's ball, actress Frances McDormand 's Oscar was briefly stolen for fifteen minutes by a man named Terry Bryant, who had a ticket to the after-party. [ 47 ] Bryant filmed himself with the statue and reportedly telling other "guests he was a winner," [ 48 ] before being apprehended by Chef Wolfgang Puck 's photographer who did not recognize Bryant as a winner and retrieved the statue from him returning it back to the actress. [ 49 ] The Academy said in a statement, "Best Actress winner Frances McDormand and her Oscar were happily reunited after a brief separation at last night’s Governors Ball. The alleged thief was quickly apprehended by a photographer and members of our fast-acting Academy and security teams." [ 50 ] Despite McDormand's consent to let Bryant go, he was arrested by the LAPD and was charged with grand theft , but was released without a bail following Wednesday's hearing after the judge ruled that "he did not pose a flight risk." [ 51 ] He appeared in court on March 28, 2018, where without any consensus his hearing was rescheduled on May 1, 2018. [ 52 ] Critical reviews [ ] The show received a mixed reception from media publications. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds an approval rating of 43% based on 30 critics, and summarized, "The 90th Academy Awards played it safe and hit no major snags -- but by clocking in at over four hours, returning host Jimmy Kimmel and company wore out their welcome long before the surprise ending." [ 53 ] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post marked, "In his second year, Kimmel has shown that the telecast needn't be anything but sharp and sure, with a funny host whose bits are manageable, shareable and – best of all – forgotten. We're not making showbiz history here; we're just trying to get through another Oscar night." [ 54 ] Chief critic David Edelstein of Vulture wrote, "This was the best, most inspiring, and most sheerly likable Academy Awards telecast I've ever seen. ... It was also – in terms of the actual awards – among the most disappointing." [ 55 ] Vanity Fair ' s, Richard Lawson wrote, "As a host, Kimmel struck a careful, appropriately measured tone ... All told, Sunday's ceremony did an admirable job of recognizing all the turmoil surrounding it while maintaining the silly, chintzy trappings that so many of us tune into the Oscars for." [ 56 ] CNN 's Brian Lowry quipped, "The Oscars are a big, unwieldy beast, which invariably try to serve too many masters. Yet if the intent was ultimately to maintain a celebratory tone without ignoring either the outside world or the elephant in the room throughout this year's awards, host Jimmy Kimmel and the show itself largely succeeded." [ 57 ] Others were more critical of the show. Television critic Maureen Ryan of Variety said, "All things considered, the show had a more or less low-key vibe. Normally it takes about two hours for the numbing effect to set in, but despite host Jimmy Kimmel's best efforts, Sunday's telecast started to feel a bit languid and low-energy far earlier." [ 58 ] Television critic James Poniewozik of The New York Times said, "despite the recent upheaval in Hollywood, the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally, in the case of the blinding set, which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode. There's also the perennial problem of bloat. The hitch, of course, is that every part of the show has its constituency." [ 59 ] Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly wrote, "What fun we had at this year's Oscars! Long show, sure, but where to cut it?" [ 60 ] Writing for Deadline Greg Evans said, "Did the nearly four-hour running time contain any moments for the Oscar ages? Probably not." [ 61 ] David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, "Even the hope that the noise of clapping might keep the audience at home and in the theater awake, there was little of that for anything except the entrance of actors of advance age." [ 62 ] The Oregonian columnist Kristi Turnquist wrote, "Was it respectful? Absolutely. Did it make for kind of a dull, earnest Oscars show? Yeah, kind of." [ 63 ] Ratings and reception [ ] Attaining 26.5 million U.S. viewers according to Nielsen ratings , the ceremony's telecast had a 16-percent drop in viewership from last year's ceremony and had the lowest U.S. viewership in Oscar history. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] On March 6, after the final ratings were confirmed, President Donald Trump took to his Twitter account, saying, "Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is, we don't have stars anymore – except your President (just kidding, of course)!". [ 66 ] [ 67 ] In response, Kimmel also tweeted, saying, "Thanks, lowest rated President in HISTORY." [ 68 ] [ 69 ] In July 2018, the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys . [ 70 ] In Memoriam [ ] The annual In Memoriam segment was introduced by Jennifer Garner with Eddie Vedder performing a rendition of Tom Petty 's song " Room at the Top ". [ 71 ] The segment paid tribute to following forty-four artists in the montage: [ 72 ] John G.
