We've got just the thing: The Golden Globe Awards air today Sunday. The first major show of the 2020 awards season , the Globes is also usually the booziest, funniest (thanks in part to returning host Ricky Gervais) and fashion-adventurous of the Hollywood events. The awards soirée is one that should be enjoyed as a frothy entertainment event, and not necessarily a prestigious Academy Awards predictor. Here's everything you need to know to watch the 77th annual celebration of film and TV stars. Golden Globes predictions: Who will win – and who should?

The Globes air Jan. 5 on NBC The show will air live coast to coast on NBC at 8 EST/5 PST. The three-hour event will take place at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. E! will present red carpet interviews with the stars live on TV, and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association will have pre-show coverage on Facebook starting at 6 EST/3 PST. After the show, the HFPA and The Hollywood Reporter will host an hourlong Twitter live stream with winner interviews. You can stream the show If you have a cable or satellite subscription, you can watch the Globes on host network’s NBC App or NBC.com . Cord-cutters can watch on their streaming services, including Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, Sling TV and PlayStation Vue. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association picks the winners The HFPA is a small group of about 90 international journalists based in Southern California. Since the group is small (and has been accused of voting for glamorous stars), winners tend to be unpredictable. Winning a Golden Globe isn't quite as prestigious as, say, taking home an Emmy Award or Oscar, but you'll still hear stars emotionally thank the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for their awards. The awards do raise awareness for nominated projects, though. Netflix's "Marriage Story," which has six Globes nominations , has plenty of momentum going into Oscars voting, which began Thursday. And the streaming service's show "Unbelievable" is nominated, which might give the series some fresh critical eyes months before the Emmy Awards. Ricky Gervais is back to host The Brit is back for a fifth time , because the HFPA "made me an offer I can't refuse," Gervais joked in a news release.  "But this is the very last time I’m doing this, which could make for a fun evening." The unpredictable and often-outrageous comedian hosted the Globes for three successive years from 2010 to 2012 and returned for a fourth time in 2016. His jokes were not limited to nominated stars; he spent plenty of time making fun of the show he was hosting. In 2012, he said, "The Golden Globes are just like the Oscars but without all that esteem. They are to the Oscar what Kim Kardashian is to Kate Middleton … a bit louder, a bit trashier, a bit drunker and more easily bought – allegedly. Nothing has been proved." The Golden Globe ambassadors are ... Pierce Brosnan's sons , Dylan, 22, and Paris Bronsan, 18, who will assist with presenting awards and handing out trophies. The ambassador honor traditionally goes to the offspring of a celebrity. Big stars turn out for the show This year's A-list nominees include Charlize Theron, Eddie Murphy, Jennifer Lopez, Al Pacino and Tom Hanks (who is set to receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement ). Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, who are also nominated, are set to present Sunday, so the barometer of star power is sure to be high, as the HFPA intended. Why else would the group have an open bar and nominate Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie for 2010's critically panned "The Tourist"? This is an invitation that celebrities tend to RSVP yes to.
