The main thing is the new concept that LEGO is trying with the LEGO Ninjago 10th Anniversary BrickHeadz (40490). Instead of a gift-with-purchase, there’s an option for you to buy it for $10 when you make an $85 purchase. I’ve heard of rumors that LEGO may try this out and it looks like it’ll be starting in a few days. June 1-30: LEGO Ninjago 10th Anniversary BrickHeadz (40490) for $10 when you make a LEGO Ninjago purchase of $85 or more, in-store only, while supplies last. June 1 – December 31: Free LEGO Blue Minifigure Keychain (854090) when you sign up for LEGO VIP. June 7-20: Free LEGO Speed Champions McLaren Elva (30343) polybag with purchase of $40 or more, while supplies last. June 21-30: Free LEGO Swing Ship Ride (5006746) with purchases of $85 or more, while supplies last. VIP membership required. June 24 – July 11: Free LEGO Minions Bon Minion with Robot Arm (30387) polybag with purchases of $40 or more, while supplies last.
