Archive Magazine golden globes nominations Golden Globe Nominations 2020: Full List of Nominees Here From The Irishman to Fleabag, here’s all you need to know about this year’s nominees. By Yohana Desta December 9, 2019 Save this story Save Save this story Save The Golden Globe nominations for 2020 are here, and while there were some surprises, predicted contenders easily muscled their way to the front. Noah Baumbach ’s lovelorn Marriage Story was the runaway hit, picking up six nominations, including best screenplay, best drama, best original score (for Randy Newman ), best supporting actress ( Laura Dern ), best actor ( Adam Driver ), and best actress ( Scarlett Johansson ). It’s the writer-director’s 12th feature and his most winning one yet on the awards circuit, thanks to a sharp script and heartbreaking lead performances. However, Quentin Tarantino ’s Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood and Martin Scorsese ’s The Irishman followed closely behind with five nominations apiece. Tarantino’s ode to Angelenos picked up expected nods for best screenplay, best supporting actor ( Brad Pitt ), best actor ( Leonardo DiCaprio ), best director, and best motion picture, musical or comedy. Scorsese’s Irishman fared similarly, picking up best director, best drama, and best screenplay (for Steve Zaillian ). However, while both Al Pacino and Joe Pesci were nominated in the best-supporting-actor category, lead actor Robert De Niro was surprisingly nowhere to be found in his category, edged out by rising contenders like Christian Bale ( Ford v Ferrari ) and Jonathan Pryce ( The Two Popes ). The HFPA also showered Bong Joon-ho ’s Parasite with three nods, including best director, best foreign language film, and best screenplay (which Joon-ho shares with Han Jin-won ). Meanwhile, late entries like Sam Mendes ’s 1917 and Rian Johnson ’s Knives Out cleaned up with three nods apiece, while Clint Eastwood ’s Richard Jewell couldn’t quite find its footing, walking away with only one nod ( Kathy Bates for best supporting actress). On the TV front, Fleabag continued its hot awards-season streak with three nods ( Andrew Scott, aka the Hot Priest, also landed a nod, a warm surprise after his Emmy snub when the British export ran away with numerous statuettes). Drama-wise, HBO’s Chernobyl and Netflix’s The Crown earned four nods apiece, while Game of Thrones walked away with a single, solitary nod (for Kit Harington ). Next year’s Golden Globes will take place on January 5, 2020, at the Beverly Hilton hotel. Ricky Gervais, an alum of the Champagne-tinged ceremony, is set to host for the fifth time in his career. The nominations were announced Monday morning by Tim Allen, Susan Kelechi Watson, and Dakota Fanning. See the full list of nominees below.
