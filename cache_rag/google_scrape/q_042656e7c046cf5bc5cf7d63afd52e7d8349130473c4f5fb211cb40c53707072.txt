Members Online • AReverieofEnvisage Just finished watching Assassins Creed movie I understand why it wasn't liked.  I do.  It didn't focus on Ezio I guess or anything else.  This was a separate story apart from Desmond.  I didn't care to be honest. I couldn't believe I waited this long to see this film.  It was awesome.  Changing the animus to allow movement to me was a welcome addition.  I absolutely loved the feel of that.  I loved the Spaniard Assassins and how each had their own look and choice of weapon. The action sequences to me were done really well and I was having fun watching them fight.  The real life segments especially near the end, caused me goosebumps.  When Michael Fassbender's character is looking at the memories of all the Grand Masters, I was overcome with emotion.  Moussa's character was bad ass. However, yeah like all AC games, the ending leaves a lot to be desired.  Sequel material right.  It felt really rushed and forced because well, there really weren't many villains in the movie, apart from that big guy.  However I liked the tone of the movie that it centered around an initiation into the Creed without really knowing. So, it took me this long to see it and I only wished I had gone to theatres to see it when it came out.  To me this is a great movie even if it wasn't accepted by the AC community.
