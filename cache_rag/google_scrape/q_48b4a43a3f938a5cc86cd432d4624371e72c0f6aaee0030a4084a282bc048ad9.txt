Learn about our editorial policies Close With so much cash thrown around Silicon Valley , it’s not easy for an acquisition to cause a stir. The 2014 purchase of WhatsApp by Facebook, now Meta, did just that. It surpassed Google's $3.2 billion purchase of Nest Labs and Apple’s $3 billion Beats Electronics procurement to become one of the largest tech buys of all time. Facebook's initial $16 billion bid for WhatsApp, originally a text messaging app used widely across the globe, stole headlines. The deal was later finalized at $21.8 billion. In 2013, the app lost $138 million and brought in $10.2 million in revenue. So how did the company win over Facebook? Key Takeaways Facebook purchased WhatsApp in 2014. Its $16 billion initial bid and the $21.8 billion final price were astronomical, even for Silicon Valley. WhatsApp requires an internet connection accessed by a mobile data network or WiFi. WhatsApp had over 2.95 billion users as of March 2025. WhatsApp has helped Facebook grow in developing markets where it is used widely to communicate. WhatsApp Acquisition WhatsApp is an ad-free mobile application that allows users to send unlimited messages to contacts using WiFi or mobile data networks. The app is free to download and is an alternative to a cellular provider's traditional text messaging service. The app was established by Jan Koum and Brian Acton, two former Yahoo! executives. When Facebook announced its plans to acquire WhatsApp in February 2014, WhatsApp's founders attached a purchase price of $16 billion: $4 billion in cash and $12 billion in Facebook shares . This price tag was dwarfed by the actual price Facebook paid: $21.8 billion. Facebook agreed to pay $19.6 billion—adding $3.6 billion to the original price as compensation to WhatsApp employees for staying on board at Facebook. However, Facebook share prices soared to $77.56 from $68 when the regulatory approval process concluded in October. By then, the agreed-upon 184 million Facebook shares inflated the final sale price by an additional $2.2 billion, bringing the final cost to the aforementioned $21.8 billion. WhatsApp's six-month revenue for the first half of 2014 totaled $15.95 million, and the company incurred a staggering net loss of $233 million. However, the majority of that loss was attributed to share-based compensation. 7 Billion The approximate number of voice messages sent by WhatsApp users every day. Why WhatsApp? WhatsApp is Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's most significant acquisition and one of the most enormous by price that Silicon Valley has ever seen. It is over 20 times larger than its Instagram acquisition, which made quite the splash in 2012. That begs the $22 billion question: Why did the social media giant break the bank to buy WhatsApp? The answer is user growth. In 2014, over 450 million people used WhatsApp monthly, and the service added more than 1 million users per day. With 70% of WhatsApp users being active daily, the app was expected to quickly reach one billion users. The app launched in 2009 and, as of 2020, had more than 2 billion users. In March 2025, the number of the app's users was approaching 3 billion. As of January 2025, Facebook had 3.07 billion monthly active users . With a shared mission of enhancing global connectivity via internet services, this merging of forces will likely accelerate growth for both companies. For Zuckerberg, user growth comes first and monetization later. WhatsApp and Mobile Users WhatsApp was used widely in developing markets where traditional cell phone call and text service was expensive or lacking. As the new owner of WhatsApp, Facebook gained access to these mobile users, which helped fuel its growth. The company believes it will profit from WhatsApp over time as phone calls become obsolete and internet-driven mobile messages reign. This is why Zuckerberg spent over one-tenth of his company's (then) market value to buy the text messaging app, nearly doubling Google's ( GOOG ) bid and keeping WhatsApp out of the hands of tech rivals. Where Is WhatsApp Most Widely Used in 2025? The country with the greatest number of WhatsApp users is India, with 532 million users. Brazil comes in second with 124 million users. Where Is WhatsApp Most Popular? Its the most popular social app in Latin America, where 92% of smartphone owners use it routinely. Is WhatsApp More Than a Chat App? Yes, its a social network that, in addition to text messaging, lets users exchange photos, videos, time-limited stories/updates, voice messages, and documents. It allows people to make voice and video calls, and has begun offering a business option of the app that's focused on connecting companies with their customers. The Bottom Line WhatsApp plays a significant role in global areas crucial to Meta's future growth. By putting monetization efforts for the app on hold, Meta has focused on the future of international, cross-platform communications. Through the acquisition of WhatsApp, the company gained the ability to reach billions of people, and it is sure to find a way to eventually cash in.
