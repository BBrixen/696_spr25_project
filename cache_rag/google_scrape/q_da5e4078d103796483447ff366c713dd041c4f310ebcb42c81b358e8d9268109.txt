Will Diablo 3 continue to receive updates after D4? - General Discussion - Diablo 3 Forums Diablo 3 Forums Will Diablo 3 continue to receive updates after D4? General Discussion Reluctant-1588 February 10, 2023,  3:09pm 1 I have and continue to enjoy Diablo 3. I sometimes need a break from other games like CoD and rocket league. This game is so reliable for a fun fast paced leveling adventure. I always enjoy trying new builds each season based on changes. It sounds like D4 will be very different probably a lot more like Diablo immortal. Is there word that D3 will continue more seasons after D4 release? 3 Likes Bruh-16978 February 10, 2023,  3:16pm 2 Remake D3 but with D4 graphics, or better. #ReskinDiablo3 Oblivion-1520 February 10, 2023,  3:16pm 3 Well, just as D2 still has ladder resets despite D3 being out, I’m pretty sure D3 will still have season resets even after D4 is released. That said, I imagine that at some point, we’ll likely have less new seasonal themes, and instead we’ll simply recycle through previous seasonal themes. Reluctant: I always enjoy trying new builds each season based on changes. Based on what we know thus far, this will definitely still be possible for D4. Kirottu-2131 February 10, 2023,  3:28pm 4 I don’t see why not. D4 will take higher priority but that doesn’t mean D3 will be abandoned after S28. It’ll likely still recieve updates but maybe not so comprehensive ones. 2 Likes ParaBellum-2652 February 10, 2023,  3:57pm 5 Kirottu: D4 will take higher priority but that doesn’t mean D3 will be abandoned after S28 agree, I think D3 never die and with the end of season 29, the second rotation of seasons will end, so I can’t wait for season 30, I think it will be the most gorgeous Reluctant-1588 February 10, 2023,  4:07pm 6 Okay great I hope so! I’ll try out Diablo 4 but pretty sure it will be just like Diablo Immortal where I find myself back to playing D3. I feel D3 style of play fits me better. The grinding in immortal was annoying. It could be a few days till you find something worth keeping. All the loot was pretty much the same. You had to spend mostly to get good gems. It was just constant grinding. D3 is grinding too but lot better rewards for time spent so most nights don’t feel like a waste. 1 Like Sighborg-21640 February 10, 2023,  4:28pm 7 I would assume so since Diablo 3 is maintained by the Classics team, which isn’t the same team as the one working on Diablo 4. There shouldn’t be any reason for them to not continue maintaining the game, although maybe it will receive slightly fewer updates shortly after D4 since I assume Blizzard would like people to try out D4. Kilometer-11340 February 10, 2023,  5:07pm 8 Most likely they will either recycle the seasonal theme or slow down the season development time frame (e.g. 6months+ per season). From a business perspective, they have no reason to make D3 players keep playing D3 (or D2) after the initial purchase when they should get as many Diablo players to stick to D4 so these players can buy BP. The more players are playing D4, the higher/better chance for D4 MTX to make money. Coreander-2636 February 10, 2023,  5:55pm 9 According to the d2 community. D4 is just a reskin of d3=p But yeah they prolly keep making seasons. I believe they will keep using d3 seasons as a way to try different things to see what ppl like. Tandem-1349 February 10, 2023,  6:07pm 10 I’m so far fairly milquetoast on D4’s combat. It’s slowed down compared to D3, and D3’s smooth and fast gameplay is its biggest draw imo. So yes, I suspect people will keep playing D3 and if they do then Blizz will likely support that. Credit where it’s due, Blizz is really good about keeping their franchises running. 1 Like Avalon-11311 February 10, 2023,  6:12pm 11 Will Diablo 3 continue to receive updates after D4? You will know if you see a season 29 and it is not just a repeat of a previous season. Unsanety-1456 February 10, 2023,  7:39pm 12 I can see them doing that with the seasons, with maybe a slight tweak here and there to make it different enough. There are enough seasons to do that as well. If they decided to extend seasons to 6months, then D3 will have another 6-7 years already planned out. Maybe after the second rotation of seasons, there will be a D3: Revisioned. Venaliter-1813 February 11, 2023,  5:53am 13 Kirottu: I don’t see why not. D4 will take higher priority but that doesn’t mean D3 will be abandoned after S28. It’ll likely still recieve updates but maybe not so comprehensive ones. “Comprehensive” ? I mean, the season theme was pretty comprehensive, but I would argue “comprehensive” patches have been very few and far between. Indian-2161 February 11, 2023,  8:02am 14 If they wanted, they could have shut down D3 years ago, with many contenders out there. But they didn’t, so D4 will not stop them either. It doesn’t worth it for the company pretty long ago, and they still put out new sesons, so why stop with D4 comeing? Kirottu-2131 February 11, 2023,  9:25am 15 Maybe “comprehensive” was a poor choice, “large as now” might be better description. D3 will likely keep getting updates but not as large as now. 1 Like Alavit-6408 February 11, 2023, 10:02am 16 D4 will NOT be like diablo immortal. Don’t listen to anyone who ever says that. Diablo immortal is a mobile game and completely different from the normal diablo franchise. Meshuggah-1994 February 11, 2023, 10:06am 17 simple answer is yes.  how will the seasons after 28 be compared to previous seasons?  my crystal ball is cracked so I cannot answer that at this time. AlienSpaceDu-1493 February 12, 2023,  3:50am 18 If people want to make Diablo 3 look prettier just use the source code in Unreal Engine 5.1 but that will never happen because no one has the source code Home Categories Guidelines Terms of Service Privacy Policy Powered by Discourse , best viewed with JavaScript enabled
