Members Online • Boss452 The Reveal trailer of Last of Us Part 2 released in December 2016, 3.5 years after the release of TLOU 1. Will we get some news this year? General Question TLOU  released in June 2013. The release of the reveal trailer for Part II was done in December 2016 at the Playstation Experience 2016, 3.5 years after the first game's release. This was the reveal trailer as we all know: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Wnvvj33Wo Now TLOU 2 also got as great reviews and critic reception as TLOU 1 and even won GOTY 2020. The audience reception is a different story altogether. But still TLOU 2 was a major commercial success and its quality, undoubtedly a better game if not in story then surely in gameplay, won over many fans. Now with the success of the show bringing some more set attention, the franchise seems to back to its glory days. 2023 is the 10 year anniversary year as TLOU turns 10 next month. As rumors suggest ND will come out with TLOU 3 and the fact that Ellie's story seems incomplete in TLOU 2, I feel it would be a great time to make an announcement this year. Do you guys feel we would be hearing some news in 2023 about Part III? Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
