Members Online • zannet_t How good is the two player mode? As titled. Thinking about getting the game as a gift to a couple (neither is a hardcore gamer so figured something lighthearted and relatable like Mario works), but my understanding is that the 2nd player only controls Cappy and I'm wondering whether it's fun at all to play as the 2nd player. Because even though I'm sure they can/will switch off, I don't want it to be a boring experience for either one of them when they're doing 2-player mode. If not Odyssey, what other games are good for two players on the Switch? I know Rabbids is kinda limited (apparently you can't go through campaign entirely as 2 players?) but there's versus so that could be interesting. Thanks for answers in advance!
