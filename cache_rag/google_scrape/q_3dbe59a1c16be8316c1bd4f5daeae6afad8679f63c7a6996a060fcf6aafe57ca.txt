Apple seems to have chosen Tuesday, September 10 Spotted by iHelpBR , the screenshot is named “HoldForRelease” and features the Calendar app with the date clearly set to Tuesday the 10th. The month isn’t displayed but the day lines up perfectly with September, which itself coincides with Apple’s usual announcement schedule. Lending further credence is the fact a similar screenshot was found in one of Apple’s iOS 12 beta releases last year which showed September 12th, the date that was subsequently confirmed for the iPhone XS and iPhone XR introductions. Considering the iPhone 11 series is now expected to debut on Tuesday, September 10, pre-orders for Apple’s upcoming trio of devices will likely commence on Friday, September 13. The actual launch, on the other hand, should happen on Friday, September 20. This coincides perfectly with the previously reported release date.

Apple has been rumored to be planning the debut of a new 10.2-inch iPad alongside its next-generation iPhones and this image suggests this will indeed be the case. iOS 13 and iPadOS 13 might arrive later than expected If Apple sticks to its typical iOS launch schedule, the upcoming iOS 13 and iPadOS 13 releases will be made available to download for devices such as the iPhone 8, iPhone XS, iPad Pro (2018), and iPad Air (2019) on Monday, September 16. However, today's findings suggest this may not be the case. Another pair of iOS 13 and iPadOS 13 screenshots which are destined to be used on older devices show the Calendar display Monday the 23rd. This is one week later than expected and ultimate suggests Apple may be giving its developers an extra week to ensure everything's in working order on previous-gen products. After all, unlike iOS 12 which was largely bug free, iOS 13 and iPadOS 13 beta releases have been plagued with issues since the beginning, many of which are still unresolved. The downside to this move is that iOS 13 and iPadOS 13 will be exclusive to the iPhone 11 series and 10.2-inch iPad (2019) for roughly three days because these are all set for release on Friday, September 20, as mentioned above. What will Apple's next iPhones actually be called? The upcoming iPhones have been consistently referred to as either the iPhone XI or iPhone 11 lineup over the course of the past year but a reliable tipster recently suggested Apple's final names may be slightly different . Specifically, they mentioned the 'Pro' moniker but left quite a bit of room for speculation because they didn't elaborate on the matter. Recommended Stories The most logical strategy would be the creation of two very separate lineups. The successor to the iPhone XR could be marketed simply as the iPhone (2019) while the iPhone XS and XS Max replacements could be called the iPhone Pro (5.8-inch) and iPhone Pro (6.5-inch). An alternative strategy which was recently mentioned by a case maker would also make sense, although the names would ultimately be more clunky. In this case, the 2019 iPhone XR would be branded as the iPhone 11 and the iPhone XS's successor would be called the iPhone 11 Pro. Meanwhile, the 6.5-inch model could land as the iPhone 11 Pro Max. The final possibility is perhaps the most straightforward one of all. It'd involve the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max replacements being marketed as the iPhone 11R, iPhone 11, and iPhone 11 Pro respectively. Did you enjoy reading this article?
