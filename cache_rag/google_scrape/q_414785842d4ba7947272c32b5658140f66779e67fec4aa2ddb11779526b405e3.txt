Enjoy your stay. Members Online • 1230986545 Does anyone feel like Chapter 2 & Chapter 3 stray too far from the original film? Discussion Take the third movie, John Wick: Chapter 3, Parabellum, for example. There is no Aurelio, no Jimmy, no Charlie, no direct mention of either Viggo or Iosef, no mention of Daisy, no mention of Perkins, no mention of Marcus, nothing about John’s car or house, and no real “Baba Yaga moments”, where people express fear of John (such as the scene where Viggo tells his son who John Wick is). Not to mention the mild appearance change in John, where he no longer rocks a vest, has longer hair, and shorter facial hair. They also barely use any music from the original movie, apart from the main John Wick theme. Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad that they expanded the universe in Chapters 2 & 3, with the High Table, markers, the Bowery, and the Continental Hotels in Rome & Morocco. But I can’t help but feel like it is overpowering canon John Wick, and this especially sticks out with moments such as when John reveals his real name is “Jardani Jovonovich” while speaking to the Director, and when John speaks to the Elder, who evidently has powers higher than the high table. Looking back at moments like these make me literally question whether this is the same John Wick from the original 2014 movie. The John Wick movies are my all-time favorite movies, but I can’t help but get upset at how far the movies have strayed from the path created in 2014. Not to mention how deep down, I know that the 4th & 5th movies are going to be even more different. Does anyone else feel the same way? Read more New to Reddit?
