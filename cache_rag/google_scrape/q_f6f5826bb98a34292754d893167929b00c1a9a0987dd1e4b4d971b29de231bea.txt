Update: The next Nintendo Direct is coming on 18th June 2024: Related Articles News Nintendo Direct June 2024: Time, Where To Watch, What To Expect Bring on the news! Ha, good one. Oh, you really want to know? Well, analysis of the date-based data above suggests that Nintendo will likely stick to a similar cadence from past years when it comes to 'full-fat' Nintendo Direct presentations. Over the past few years, the schedule has one early in the year (around February), one in June (typically to coincide with the now-defunct E3), and another in September in the run-up to the lucrative holiday season. There's no reason to think Nintendo won't stick to a similar timetable with future Directs. It's an established formula that works with/around scheduling for other major events in the gaming and business calendars. While the company enjoys playing with and subverting people's expectations, there's no reason to give up on a marketing strategy and timetable that, historically, has been a winner. And this year, in a break from the norm, in an attempt to quash 'Switch 2' rumours, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa gave us all a heads-up by announcing that a planned June Nintendo Direct wouldn't feature new hardware announcements. And remember, while the real blow-outs tend to some two or three times a year, a smaller broadcast could be announced at pretty much any time.

Nintendo Directs are videos created by Nintendo to announce and showcase upcoming video games and hardware, directly to fans via broadcasts presented by Nintendo employees. Starting in October 2011, Nintendo has put out regular Direct presentations of different types — some focusing on a specific game or system, with others featuring third-party publishers or indie games. Other Direct showcases cover non-gaming, Nintendo-related products, such as The Super Mario Bros. Movie . Nintendo Direct Types Nintendo Direct The flagship 'full-fat' format, typically showcasing a mix of first- and third-party titles and hardware or peripherals. Before 2017, these could include system-specific Nintendo Directs for the 3DS or Wii U, until the company converged its handheld and home console hardware into a single system, the Switch. Nintendo E3 Direct presentations took place for several years before halting in 2020 when E3 was cancelled due to COVID-19. Nintendo Direct Mini / Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase As per the name, a shorter version of the Direct format. Narrators introduce and discuss the game in segments, with headline-style inserts before gameplay is shown. Partner Showcases feature no first-party Nintendo software, highlighting third-party games only. Indie World A format that highlights games from smaller developers and publishers. Preceded by Nindies Showcases and Indie Highlights presentation. One-Off Nintendo Direct Specials On occasion, Nintendo will produce a game or series-specific Direct to showcase a single game. Examples of this include the 'Mr Sakurai Presents' Super Smash Bros. Direct DLC presentations, the Super Mario Bros. 35th Anniversary Nintendo Direct, and the Super Nintendo World Direct. Pokémon Direct / Pokémon Presents A broadcast devoted to, as the name suggests, all things Pokémon. These are presented by employees of The Pokémon Company rather than Nintendo staff and often cover non-gaming Pokémon events and products, in addition to software news. As a recurrent, series-specific presentation, we haven't included Pokémon Presents in the lists above. Hopefully this Nintendo Direct guide has been useful. We'll be updating it with new information, direct to you, as and when it drops — this will remain the place for all your past Nintendo Direct needs.
