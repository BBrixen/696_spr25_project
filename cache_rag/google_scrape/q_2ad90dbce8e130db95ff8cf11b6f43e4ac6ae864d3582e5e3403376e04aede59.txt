Psychotext Member Oct 30, 2017 18,351 Jul 27, 2019 #152 Not as exciting as it could have been, but I'm made up for G / Bernal. Shame JA couldn't have made the podium though. Ortix Banned Oct 27, 2017 1,438 Jul 27, 2019 #153 Psychotext said: There's an argument it hurt G as much as anything.  He was in a solid group that was pushing on and likely would have caught Bernal as he'd burned a bunch of matches. But it is what it is. Click to expand... Click to shrink... That "solid group" was losing time on Bernal, both in the climb and in the descent. The most likely scenario was Bernal just gaining more time on everyone (and Alaphilippe losing more) Oscillator Banned Oct 30, 2017 1,787 Canada Jul 27, 2019 #154 KingFox said: Damn, not even a French rider on the podium would be pretty disappointing after these three weeks.

T8SC Member Oct 28, 2017 908 UK Jul 27, 2019 #155 Well done to Team Ineos, great to see such a young winner of the TdF also with Egan Bernal. Well done, great effort. I hope SIS have a good sale on for Ineos winning, I need some new nutrition. :-D HTupolev Member Oct 27, 2017 3,004 Jul 27, 2019 #156 offtopic said: I agree the 'what-if' game could go around forever (and I'm not claiming it hurt JA more than anyone else...just that QS could pretty easily claim that it did) but isn't the fact that nobody knows how it would have played out and riders had no way to account for this randomness a big problem and a bad precedent? In future races can we no longer let breakaways get up the road if there is any sign of bad weather anywhere in a 120 mile stretch? If I'm a team manager this certainly changes who I put into breakaways in addition to a huge number of other decisions. Click to expand... Click to shrink... There's no option that doesn't risk some kind of bad precedent. If you neutralize the whole stage, then it presents the opposite risk of long-range attacks being pointless. The deciding factor of whether it becomes problematic is whether mechanisms like this start being abused, not which particular choice happened to get made. Throughout the history of cycling, this mostly hasn't been a problem. It seems like a situation ripe for a challenge of some sort. Click to expand... Click to shrink... Within the race itself, it is not. There is no mechanism to challenge this type of decision. If the cycling community thinks that the race director acted in bad faith or with great stupidity, the "challenge" would largely take the form of a loss of confidence in the event and its planners. Obviously the Tour organizers don't want that. If someone wants to swing things in favor of a particular rider, that'll happen more subtle many months beforehand in the form of route planning. :) Joni Member Oct 27, 2017 19,508 Jul 27, 2019 #157 HTupolev said: If the cycling community thinks that the race director acted in bad faith or with great stupidity, the "challenge" would largely take the form of a loss of confidence in the event and its planners.

Suppose that they do lose confidence? What can they do? The teams are forced to participate. HTupolev Member Oct 27, 2017 3,004 Jul 27, 2019 #158 Joni said: Suppose that they do lose confidence? What can they do? The teams are forced to participate. Click to expand... Click to shrink... I don't mean "lose confidence" in the sense that the teams are feeling grouchy. I mean "lose confidence" in the sense of risk to the bottom line and political pressure being put on the UCI and ASO to sort the situation out. The TdF's prestige and profitability is dependent on public faith that the race organizers aren't cheating. OP OP weekev Is this a test? Member Oct 25, 2017 6,373 Jul 27, 2019 #159 Bit of an anti-climax. The weather and pinots injury kind of spoiled the ending. Fair play to Bernal though. Sheepinator Member Jul 25, 2018 30,017 Jul 29, 2019 #160 Did anyone else think Groenewegen coasted the last few meters there, thinking he had it in the bag? I think Ewan would have won anyway as he was going so fast, but maybe not.

But he didn't look like he was about to start celebrating either, so I don't know.

Nah, he saw Ewan had the overspeed and forfeited. bobnowhere Member Oct 26, 2017 2,592 Elsewhere for 8 minutes Jul 29, 2019 #163 Didn't realise we had a thread this year, hasn't been one for a few years.   Great tour for Australia, 4 wins for Mitchelton--Scott and 3 for Ewan.  Ewan was clearly the fastest though can still get out muscled in the build up and end up too far back at times.  He and Gaviria are the fastest two in the world now, should be fun watching them go at it for the next 10 years or so. Geoff Banned Oct 27, 2017 7,115 Jul 29, 2019 #164 Such a bad end to what was shaping up to be an all time great tour. Nothing anyone could really do but I was really pissed off on Saturday when it became clear that everyone was just going to settle for the places they had. The absolute worst thing about the Tour in recent years is the podium and top ten placed riders just accepting their fate and not even trying to attack the Skyneos riders. Understand it's easier said than done. Sheepinator Member Jul 25, 2018 30,017 Jul 29, 2019 #165 NewDust said: Nah, he saw Ewan had the overspeed and forfeited. Click to expand... Click to shrink... Maybe. It's just the last 1-2 seconds though, strange time to give up. There's a great side shot here, and it looks like he saw Ewan coming on the right, but then he looks down, so it's possible he knew he had lost but I'm not sure. I wonder if he's kicking himself for stopping that short of the line though. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVB09JYBlw8&t=265s Astandahl Member Oct 28, 2017 9,451 Jul 29, 2019 #166 Geoff said: Such a bad end to what was shaping up to be an all time great tour.
