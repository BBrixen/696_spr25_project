Jeanty defeated both Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel and Colorado two-way standout Travis Hunter, the two other finalists. NCAA head football coaches, sports information director, select national media, and Maxwell Football Club members vote on the award each year. This marks just the second time in the last 22 seasons that a running back has received the Maxwell Award. Former Alabama running Derrick Henry was the last to accomplish the feat in 2015. Of the 11 total running backs to win the award since 1979, nine went on to win the Heisman Trophy as well. Jeanty set the Boise State single-season record with 2,497 rushing yards and 29 rushing touchdowns this fall. He almost became just the fourth FBS player with at least 2,000 rushing yards and 30 total touchdowns in a single season since 1956. He is also just 132 rushing yards away from breaking Barry Sanders’ single-season rushing record (2,628), one of the more hallowed records in all of college football. In recent years the winner of the Maxwell Award has often claimed the Heisman Trophy. Eight of the last 10 Maxwell Award recipients also won the Heisman Trophy. Jeanty is the first player from a Group of 5 school to earn this specific honor since former BYU quarterback Ty Detmer in 1990. This is the second national honor Jeanty claimed on Thursday. He also won the Doak Walker Award, presented annually to the top running back in college football. Jeanty now takes aim at the Heisman Trophy, which will be announced in New York on Saturday.
