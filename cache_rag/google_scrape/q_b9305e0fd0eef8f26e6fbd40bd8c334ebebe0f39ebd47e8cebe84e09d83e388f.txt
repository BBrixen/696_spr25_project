Members Online • real_osuchalke When is the best time to start Phantom Liberty in terms of it's story? Discussion So i know that you can start Phantom Liberty after the Voodo Boys questline, and i know that a 15-20 lv is a good place to do it , but those are not my question. Without spoiling, i simply wonder how does the PL chapter coexist with the main storyline and V's story in general. What is the best order to fully immers yourself into V's storyarc and get the most of PL content. I haven't started Dogtown yet but im really close to getting the oportunity to do so, and as i have played Cyberpunk before but not PL it makes me wonder what is the best strategy to tackle it. It's important to me as i won't have opportunity to compleate it once again because of numerous other things that i have lined up. So i want to give it my best shot in order to get the most out of PL story. Should i start PL as soon as possible? Or should i first compleate some of the Act 2 missions (like Rouge/Panam storyline first) ? Should i mix in PL with main storyline or compleate one first? How did you do it and what would you change your first playthrough if you had chance to do it again? Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
