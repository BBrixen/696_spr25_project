He explained: "I just wanted to be influenced by the story and how the director today was going to reinterpret it for the stage. "You have to remember the film is literally mostly close-ups of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts so it's not really set as a wide angle. "So how do you transcend those very personal shots into song, that was the challenge." Adams is on tour in the UK until 6 March.
