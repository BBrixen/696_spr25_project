Members Online • Antman269 Why did it take so long for Naughty Dog to release a PS5 port of Part 2? PT 2 QUESTION Part 2 is finally getting an enhanced PS5 version, but it will have been 3.5 years since the PS4 version released, and I don’t understand why it took so long. It came out at the end of the PS4’s life cycle, just a few months before the PS5 came out, and other games from that time span like Death Stranding, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and Ghost of Tsushima all got PS5 versions much sooner, as well as games that came out much earlier and were in less demand for an upgrade, like Uncharted 4 and Spider-Man 1. Part 1 originally released on PS3, and it only took one year for the PS4 version. Why did Part 2 take so much longer for a PS5 version? It isn’t giving the game a full graphical overhaul compared to the PS5 remake of Part 1, which came out first. Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
