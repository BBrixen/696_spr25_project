What Happened : On Oct. 9, 2006, Google announced it was paying $1.65 billion in a stock-for-stock deal to acquire video platform YouTube, which is now one of its biggest revenue drivers. "The YouTube team has built and exciting and powerful media platforms that complement Google's mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful," former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said at the time. "Together, we are natural partners to offer a compelling media entertainment service to users, content owners and advertisers.” In the last fiscal year, YouTube ads brought in $36.2 billion in revenue, broken down below by quarter: Q1: $8.1 billion Q2: $8.7 billion Q3: $8.9 billion Q4: $10.5 billion The YouTube segment has also increased Alphabet's presence in the streaming market with an offering that includes its own videos and content from other media partners with YouTube TV.

Alphabet gets subscription and advertising revenue from the YouTube segment, which is believed to total more than $50 billion on an annual basis.

The video platform sees an average of 20 million videos uploaded every single day.
