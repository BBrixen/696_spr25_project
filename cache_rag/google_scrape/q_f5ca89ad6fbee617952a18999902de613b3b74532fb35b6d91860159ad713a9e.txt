Oct 19, 2017 at 05:00 AM Copied! At today's NFL Fall League Meeting in New York City, NFL owners officially awarded Super Bowl LV in 2021 to Tampa. In May, it was announced that Tampa had been offered the Super Bowl on the condition that the city meet certain requirements related to its bid. With today's announcement, the city now turns its focus to preparing to host the league's premier event for the fifth time. "The final approval of Super Bowl LV is a great source of pride for the Glazer family, the Buccaneers organization and the entire Tampa Bay region," Buccaneers Co-Chairman Bryan Glazer said. "We have made substantial improvements in recent years to ensure that Raymond James Stadium could ultimately host the game for a third time and we appreciate that our fellow owners have recognized the stadium and our area's long and distinguished history as a world-class host city." Tampa - which trails only Miami, New Orleans and Los Angeles in the total number of Super Bowls hosted - has been the site of the game in 1984, 1991, 2001 and 2009. This year's Super Bowl will be held in Minnesota, followed by Atlanta, Miami and, ultimately, Tampa. Tampa hosted the College Football National Championship game this past January. Raymond James Stadium is in the midst of a four-phase, $150 million renovation that will be completed by the start of the 2018 NFL season.
