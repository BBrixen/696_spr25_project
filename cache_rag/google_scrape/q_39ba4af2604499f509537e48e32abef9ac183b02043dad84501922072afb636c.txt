[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Both are also the only instances in her career where she made the quarterfinals at the majors. Personal life [ edit ] From Mount Pleasant, South Carolina , Rogers followed her sister, Sabra, into tennis at the age of six. She was quickly identified by her coaches for her natural athletic ability and started competing on the national stage by the age of 11. Home-schooled during high school, Rogers was able to focus on her tennis and quickly started receiving scholarship offers from the top schools in the U.S. [ 4 ] In 2009, she decided to forgo college and become a professional tennis player. [ 5 ] On August 15, 2021, Rogers was awarded with a Bachelor of Science in psychology from Indiana University East in a ceremony at the Western Southern Open (WSO) tournament.
