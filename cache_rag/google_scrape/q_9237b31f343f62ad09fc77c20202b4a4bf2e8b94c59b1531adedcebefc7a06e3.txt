The Experience Golf Team The Open Championship , often referred to simply as The Open, is the oldest and most prestigious tournament in golf. Following a meeting outside the Red Lion Inn in Prestwick in 1860 The Open was born. This legendary competition has shaped the sport, producing some of the most memorable moments in golfing history. From its humble beginnings to its status as a global sporting spectacle, The Open is a true test of skill, resilience, and mastery of links golf. As The 153rd Open returns to Royal Portrush in 2025, now is the perfect time to explore the history of this iconic tournament - and perhaps even walk in the footsteps of champions on one of the legendary Open rota courses. The Birth of The Open Championship The inaugural Open Championship was held at Prestwick Golf Club in Scotland on 17th October 1860. The tournament was established to determine the best golfer of the time, with eight players competing for the title. The first-ever winner was Willie Park Sr., who triumphed over Old Tom Morris to become the original Champion Golfer of the Year. Over the decades, The Open expanded beyond Prestwick, finding homes at some of the world’s most renowned courses and evolving into the international event it is today. The Iconic Open Rota Courses Since those early days, The Open has been hosted at a select group of world-class courses known as the Open rota. These courses represent the pinnacle of links golf, offering unpredictable weather conditions, undulating fairways, and deep pot bunkers that challenge even the best players. Some of the most famous Open venues include: St Andrews (The Old Course) – The spiritual home of golf, hosting The Open more times than any other venue. Royal Troon – Famous for its dramatic 8th hole, The Postage Stamp, and one of the most stern back nines on the rota. Muirfield – A true championship test, where some of the greatest names in golf have triumphed. Currently not active on the rota but the hope is that it will reappear soon. Royal Birkdale – Known for its demanding layout and deep rough. Royal Portrush – A stunning links course set to host The 153rd Open in 2025. For those looking to experience the challenge of an Open venue, The Experience Golf offers exclusive access to play these legendary courses, following in the footsteps of the game’s greatest players. Record-Breakers and Legends of The Open The Open has witnessed some of the most remarkable performances in golf history. Harry Vardon holds the record for the most Open victories, winning six times between 1896 and 1914. Other legends who have lifted the Claret Jug include: Jack Nicklaus – Three-time winner and one of the most dominant players in major history. Seve Ballesteros – A charismatic champion who won The Open three times. Tiger Woods – Secured three victories, including his iconic win at St Andrews in 2000. Tom Watson – A five-time Open champion who defined links golf brilliance. Each year, new legends are made, and the drama continues to unfold on golf’s most historic stage.
