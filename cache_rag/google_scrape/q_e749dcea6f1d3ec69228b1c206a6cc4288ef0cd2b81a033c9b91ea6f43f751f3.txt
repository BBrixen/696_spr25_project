They first met in 2012 at the French Open where, in her second Grand Slam main draw appearance, Barty was defeated in straight sets. The pair's next clash came more than five years later, in 2017, in the final of Birmingham where Kvitová came back from a set down to claim the title, before replicating a similar victory in the Sydney final in 2019. They met once more two weeks later in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open where Kvitová moved past Barty in straight sets. [ 11 ] Barty then went on to record her first win two months later in the quarterfinals of the Miami Open . She then recorded a further three consecutive victories – in the quarterfinals of the 2019 China Open , in the round-robin stage of the 2019 WTA Finals , [ 12 ] and in the quarterfinals of the 2020 Australian Open , the latter two in straight sets. Nonetheless, Kvitová snapped her losing streak in the semifinals of the Qatar Open , recording her fifth win over Barty in the process. This was the final match played by Barty in 2020, as she opted not to play again for the rest of the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic . [ 13 ] Barty and Kvitová resumed their rivalry at the 2021 Madrid Open with Barty prevailing in three sets, thus winning her fifth out of their last six matches.

Sabalenka then won the next two encounters later in the year; once in the semifinals of the Wuhan Open and then just a month later in the Round Robin of the WTA Elite Trophy , both in straight sets, however Barty did go on to win the latter tournament. Barty then avenged those losses the year after at the Fed Cup , defeating her solidly in straight sets. They once again met each other in the semifinals of Wuhan, in a rematch of the previous years semifinal match, with Sabalenka taking the win once again. The next time they met was in the quarterfinals of the Miami Open in 2021 where Barty defeated her in three sets to defend her title. They then met in consecutive clay-court finals in the Stuttgart Open , where Barty prevailed, and the Madrid Open , where Sabalenka took her first WTA 1000 (Mandatory) title.
