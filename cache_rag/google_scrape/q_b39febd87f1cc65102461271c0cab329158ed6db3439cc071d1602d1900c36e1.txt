Suits first have to be unlocked, either by completing a specific mission, or reaching a certain level, and then purchased with tokens . While each suit comes with a signature power of its own, these can be swapped depending on players' gameplay style or preference. Players may also customize their suits with up to three suit mods , which grant various passive bonuses. The ability to choose and craft suits only becomes available after players have unlocked the Advanced Suit via discussion with Otto Octavius in his lab , at roughly level 3. There are a total of 47 suits (45 in the PlayStation 4 version) obtainable in the game. There are 28 suits available to unlock in the main story, nine suits obtained in The City That Never Sleeps (three suits per DLC campaign), eight suits added through free updates to the PlayStation 4 version (or available from the start in the remaster), and two suits exclusive to the remaster that were added through a free update to the PlayStation 5 version (or available from the start in the PC version).
