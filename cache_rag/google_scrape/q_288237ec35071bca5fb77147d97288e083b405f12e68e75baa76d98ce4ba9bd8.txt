The Emmy winning comedian and host of "Jimmy Kimmel Live" impressed with his hosting duties in 2017, but that ceremony is probably best remembered for its twist ending: "La La Land" was announced as the winner for Best Picture, but minutes later it was revealed that the wrong winner had been announced and that "Moonlight" was the rightful victor. Was the 2018 Best Picture outcome just as shocking? Scroll down for our live updating report and analysis of the winners as they happened. " Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri " was the front-runner for Best Picture going into Oscar night after winning top prizes at the Golden Globes, SAG Awards and BAFTAs. But close behind was " The Shape of Water ," the winner at the Producers Guild, Directors Guild and Critics' Choice Awards. And don't forget " Get Out ," which won the Independent Spirit Award just like five of the previous six Oscar winners for Best Picture. SIGN UP for Gold Derby’s free newsletter with latest predictions So what happened on Oscar night, and how can we make sense of it all? Follow along below for our take on all the winners as they were announced. ( All times listed are Eastern .) 8:00pm -- Let the games begin! 8:15pm -- Sam Rockwell wins the first award of the night: Best Supporting Actor for "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri." This was his first nomination and win, and he had to get past his co-star Woody Harrelson . But Rockwell had already won a Golden Globe, SAG Award, Critics' Choice Award and BAFTA, so this victory came as little surprise. He was the overwhelming front-runner according to our racetrack odds. "You guys rock!" said Rockwell to his fellow nominees while accepting his awards. "My mom and dad's love of movies became my love of movies." He also wished to thank "anyone who has looked at a billboard." And in the end he dedicated the prize to his "old buddy Phil Hoffman." Watch our interview with Rockwell from earlier this season here . 8:25pm -- "Darkest Hour" claims Best Makeup and Hairstyling, another expected win. It was up against "Wonder" and "Victoria and Abdul," which had few other Oscar nominations. The prize went to David Malinowski , Lucy Sibbick and Kazuhiro Tsuji , the last of whom came out of retirement to make the film. And that makeup is expected to help Gary Oldman win Best Actor later in the evening. Watch our interview with Tsuji here . 8:31pm -- Mark Bridges wins Best Costume Design for "Phantom Thread," his second win in three nominations following his victory for "The Artist" (2011) The film is all about a fashion designer, who it's understandable that its "Phantom" threads would take this award. So far all three prizes that have been handed out have gone to the overwhelming front-runners, but we haven't gotten to any races that were considered especially close yet, so stay tuned!

[POLL] 8:39pm -- In what was a fairly close race for Best Documentary Feature, Netflix's "Icarus" pulled off a bit of an upset against the presumed front-runner "Faces Places" by legendary filmmaker Agnes Varda , who received an Honorary Oscar last fall. "Icarus" tells the story of the Russian athletic doping scandal and undoubtedly struck a chord during the month of the 2018 Winter Olympics and amid scandal about Russian interference with the 2016 US presidential election. Watch our interview with "Icarus" filmmakers Bryan Fogel and Dan Cogan here . 8:58pm -- Richard King and Alex Gibson win Best Sound Editing for "Dunkirk," as widely expected. The World War II drama also won Best Sound Mixing for Gregg Landaker , Gary A. Rizzo and Mark Weingarten . It was strange, then, that the stars of "Baby Driver," Ansel Elgort and Eiza Gonzalez , were made to present the awards that their own film was losing. It's always an uncomfortable moment. I don't know why awards producers do that. Nevertheless, this was a historic win for Richard King, who is now the most awarded sound editor in Oscar history. 9:08pm -- "The Shape of Water" takes its first award of the night, Best Production Design, another victory we were expecting despite a strong challenge from "Blade Runner 2049." The winners are all first-time contenders: Paul D. Austerberry , Shane Vieau and Jeffrey A. Melvin . The film had also won Best Production Design at the BAFTA Awards, Critics' Choice Awards and Art Directors Guild Awards.

It's the first Chilean film ever to win and only the second to be nominated. It's even more groundbreaking for telling the story of a transgender woman with a trans actress ( Daniela Vega ) in the leading role. "This is an amazing gift," says director Sebastian Lelio upon accepting the award. 9:27pm -- After seven Emmys, Allison Janney won her first Oscar on her first try. She prevailed for her role as Tonya Harding 's abusive mother in "I, Tonya." She had won Best Supporting Actress at the Golden Globes, Critics' Choice Awards, SAG Awards and BAFTAs, so she had been the overwhelming favorite to win, though the early front-runner was Laurie Metcalf ("Lady Bird"). "I did it all by myself," joked Janney upon accepting the award. When she went into her real "Thank yous," she singled out screenwriter Steven Rogers for writing the role with her in mind. 9:37pm -- "Dear Basketball" wins Best Animated Short. It's the first win for animated Glen Keane and basketball player Kobe Bryant . Keane has been a longtime animator, but this was his first ever Oscar nomination and win.

The prize goes to director Lee Unkrich and producer Darla K. Anderson . Unkrich previously won Best Animated Feature for "Toy Story 3" (2010) while Anderson was a Best Picture nominee for "Toy Story 3." "Marginalized people deserve to feel like they belong," says Unkrich upon accepting the award. "Representation matters." 9:53pm -- "Blade Runner 2049" wins the war against "Planet of the Apes" for Best Visual Effects. The honored effects artists are John Nelson , Gerd Nefzer , Paul Lambert , Richard R. Hoover . Could this be good news for Roger Deakins for Best Cinematography? Those two awards have gone together multiple times in recent years, and Deakins is long overdue after 14 nominations and no wins. 9:56pm -- "Dunkirk" claims its third award of the night, Best Film Editing for "Dunkirk." Editor Lee Smith wins for the first time following previous bids for "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" (2003) and "The Dark Knight" (2008). "I'm an editor, I should be able to do this very quickly," said Hall as time was running out for his speech. Hall had previously won ACE Eddie and Critics' Choice Awards for his cutting of "Dunkirk," though "Baby Driver" did pull off an upset at the BAFTAs, which made this race a bit of a nail-biter.

Director Frank Stiefel is a first-time winner and first-time nominee. The film profiles mentally ill artist Mindy Alper . 10:18pm -- "The Silent Child" is another surprise winner, prevailing for Best Live Action Short over "DeKalb Elementary." The award goes to director Chris Overton and writer-producer-star Rachel Shenton . The film tells the story of a deaf child torn between a caretaker who teaches her to sign and a family that wants her to read lips. 10:32pm -- James Ivory wins Best Adapted Screenplay for "Call Me by Your Name." This is his first Oscar win and fourth nomination following bids for directing "A Room with a View," "Howards End" and "The Remains of the Day." At age 89, Ivory is the oldest competitive Oscar winner in history. The film is based on the novel by Andre Aciman . Watch our interview with Ivory here . SEE Oscars 2018 live pre-show: Two hours of last minute predictions chaos with 15 Gold Derby editors and contributors [WATCH] 10:37pm -- Jordan Peele wins Best Original Screenplay for "Get Out." This was one of the closest races of the year; Peele was up against Greta Gerwig ("Lady Bird") and Martin McDonagh ("Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"). Peele isn't the first black writer to win an Oscar, but he is the first to win Original Screenplay. Does this give "Get Out" the edge for Best Picture? The last five Best Picture winners have won a writing award. 10:48pm -- Roger Deakins FINALLY wins an Oscar and gets a well-deserved standing ovation from the audience. He had been nominated 14 times spanning more than 20 years. "I really love my job. I've been doing it a long time as you can see," he said upon accepting the award. Given how beautiful his work has been over the years and how long he had waited for recognition, this may be the most satisfying victory of the night. 10:59pm -- Alexandre Desplat wins his second Oscar for Best Original Score thanks to his compositions for "The Shape of Water." He won his first prize for "The Grand Budapest Hotel" (2014) on his eighth try. This is his ninth nomination overall. "The Shape of Water" has now won twice for the night in addition to its earlier victory for Best Production Design. Watch out interview with Desplat here . SEE 2018 Oscars: McDormand, Oldman, Janney and Rockwell are the first group of acting winners to sweep all the major awards 11:03pm -- "When you look at a category like ours it helps you imagine a world where all categories look like ours," said Kristen Anderson-Lopez upon accepting Best Original Song for "Remember Me" from "Coco" along with her husband and co-writer Robert Lopez . Anderson-Lopez was noting the gender and ethnic diversity in their category. Robert Lopez added, "This is for my mom who passed away. Everyone who knew her will always remember her." These songwriters previously won this category for "Let it Go" from "Frozen." 11:14pm -- Guillermo Del Toro wins Best Director for "The Shape of Water" in one of the more expected outcomes of the night. "I am an immigrant ... like many, many of you," says Del Toro, citing fellow Mexican Best Director winners Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu ("Birdman" and "The Revenant") and Alfonso Cuaron ("Gravity"). He adds that movies "erase the lines in the sand ... when the world tells us to make them deeper." 11:24pm -- Gary Oldman wins Best Actor for "Darkest Hour." This is the second win for the film and the first ever win for Oldman, who received a standing ovation from the audience. "I owe this and so much more to so many. I've lived in America for the longest time," he said, and and is grateful for the "wonderful gifts it has given me." SEE Reflecting on Meryl Streep’s record 21 Oscar nominations and celebrating her 3 wins (to date) 11:33pm -- Frances McDormand wins Best Actress for "Three Billboards." This is her second win and fifth career nomination. She previously won Best Actress for "Fargo" (1996). "I'm hyperventilating, so if I fall over pick me up because I've got some things to say." She feels like " Chloe Kim after she did back-to-back 1080s in the half-pipe." She asks all the female nominees in the room to stand: "Look around ... we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed." 11:46pm -- "The Shape of Water" takes the top prize of the night: Best Picture. That brings its total for the night to four  awards. Director Del Toro wins again as a producer along with J. Miles Dale . Del Toro made sure to double-check the envelope after Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty read the result. Steven Spielberg told Del Toro that if he won, "Remember that you are part of a legacy ... and be proud of it." "The Shape of Water" managed this victory despite losing the Golden Globe and BAFTA Award to "Three Billboards." It's also the first Best Picture winner without a corresponding SAG nomination for its ensemble cast since "Braveheart" (1995). 16 thoughts on “2018 Oscar winners and analysis: ‘The Shape of Water’ takes down ‘Three Billboards’ for Best Picture, comes away with 4 awards overall” joseph kitchens says: March 4, 2018 at 7:11 pm keep winning Dunkirk Reply Gabe Guarin says: March 4, 2018 at 7:59 pm Roger Deakins FINALLY! Yay!!! Reply Eric Close says: March 4, 2018 at 8:54 pm Seeing him in person finally, though, it does kind of make sense why they kept him off that stage for so many years.  Man, what a loon!  lol Reply Gabe Guarin says: March 4, 2018 at 9:03 pm Fun stat: The Shape of Water is the first film since 1948’s Hamlet to win both the Venice Film Festival Golden Lion and the Academy Award for Best Picture. Looks like Laurence Olivier’s second unique Oscar record has finally been broken! Olivier was also the only performer to direct himself to an Oscar win, again for Hamlet, until Roberto Bengini repeated the feat 50 years later with Life is Beautiful. Reply Timothy Best says: March 4, 2018 at 9:13 pm And of course, the least of my favorite of the 9 films nominated for Best Picture wins. Really Academy???? Once again you’ve voted a film that won’t be remembered years from now in the leagues of Shakespeare In Love, American Beauty, A Beautiful Mind, Crash The Kings Speech and Birdman just to name a few. The Oscars are losing their respectability.  Thanks again for another very predictable show. Reply Ivo Stoyanov says: March 4, 2018 at 9:31 pm Timothy, your subjectivity is pathetic, you just named a few of the most memorable and respected winners of all time, grow up! Reply Award Chaos says: March 4, 2018 at 10:06 pm LOL totes, Shakespeare in Love, American Beauty, Birdman are great film, the fact that you can’t see it means nothing. Reply Timothy Best says: March 5, 2018 at 4:15 pm And yes, you have a right to your opinion as I do mine. What will these films be remembered for in 20 years???? Reply Gabe Guarin says: March 8, 2018 at 10:35 am We’ll just have to wait and see. But don’t go condemning others for having opinions that differ from yours. Reply EraserHead77 says: March 4, 2018 at 9:57 pm American Beauty is a great movie except for the fact that Kevin Spacey Sucks as a person. Birdman is a great movie. The other movies i can agree with though. A Beautiful Mind is a decent movie but Mulholland Dr. should have won best picture that year. Reply James Breheney says: March 4, 2018 at 10:52 pm Some of those Best Picture winners you mentioned don’t belong with the others. American Beauty, A Beautiful Mind and The King’s Speech were all rightful winners. The others you mentioned are debatable. Reply Timothy Best says: March 5, 2018 at 4:21 pm I’d recommend The Insider 1999, In the Bedroom or Gosford Park 2001, The Social Network or Winter’s Bone 2010. Reply Gabe Guarin says: March 4, 2018 at 11:53 pm As for Icarus, we should’ve remembered the Salesman situation last year. Reply Timothy Best says: March 8, 2018 at 3:57 pm by the way, Icarus has nothing to do with TSOW winning Best Picture. The Salesman won because it was a very good film, no other political reason!! Reply jimmy barr says: March 9, 2018 at 8:00 am Still sorry we had to witness Sally Hawkins’ boobs in the film Oscar bestowed Best Picture.  Her handjob in the bathtub was another unnecessary event we had to see. Reply Jeff says: March 13, 2018 at 10:48 am and the Michael Shannon and his horny wife sex scene was unnecessary. Just thrown in there to call it an adult fairy tale?  would have worked without those and the shower with the creature sex scenes. Really?
