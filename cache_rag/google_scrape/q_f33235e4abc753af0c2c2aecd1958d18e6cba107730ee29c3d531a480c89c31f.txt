(Image credit: Getty Images | Anadolu) Over the past few years, generative AI has scaled great heights and become more advanced with incredible capabilities like OpenAI's new ChatGPT-4o image generator that went viral on social media with Studio Ghibli-inspired memes . OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed his disappointment with the company's GPT-4, admitting that it " kind of sucks " and that it's mildly embarrassing at best . "GPT-4 is the dumbest model any of you will ever have to use again by a lot," added Altman. "It's important to ship early and often and we believe in iterative deployment." As it turns out, OpenAI is getting ready to pull the plug on GPT-4. According to a changelog posted by the company late last week, GPT-4 will be effectively replaced by GPT-4o on April 30, 2025, as the default model in ChatGPT. However, GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI's API.
