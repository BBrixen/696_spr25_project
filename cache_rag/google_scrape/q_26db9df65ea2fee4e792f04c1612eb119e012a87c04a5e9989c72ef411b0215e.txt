Members Online • Enthusiastic_Bagels You know how BOTW was announced for the Wii U and Nintendo delayed/kept refining the game until a new console was launched? Welcome to the development cycle for BOTW2 Speculation TL:DR-History tends to repeat itself If something like this has been posted, I’ll take it down cause I don’t wanna be redundant. Work on Breath of the Wild started as soon as Skyward Sword dropped, and wasn’t formally announced until a Wii U January 23, 2013. BOTW was released March 3, 2017, more than 4 years later. Now, I’m not saying I want the sequel to be rushed. I think BOTW will be an all time classic, and with good reason. It’s nearly a perfect game, and much of that is due to the fact that Nintendo kept delaying the release to polish and perfect it. But it feels eerily similar to the post Skyward Sword Zelda hype train. Long swaths of no information, only to get confirmation that yes, we are still working on the game. I’m happy to wait for BOTW2, and I hope the switch has more life in it. I would be happy with this console for a long time. I was actually quite pleased with the most recent direct, so it’s not like there won’t be any games to play. I just feel like the next console will be the focus of the sequel, and the switch will be second fiddle to the next big bad Nintendo console. I hope I’m wrong, but it just feels like more of the same. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. New to Reddit?
