The figure skating team event ended with the United States in third, adding a bronze medal to its total. The Americans finished behind the Olympic Athletes of Russia and Canada, who took silver and gold, respectively. Then in the women’s slopestyle snowboarding event, the Americans dominated as usual. Specifically, Jamie Anderson defended her Sochi gold medal in the event by taking the gold on Sunday evening. Lurie Blouin of Canada and Enni Rukajarvi of Finland finished second and third, respectively, on the podium. Before Sunday The United States picked up its first gold medal when 17-year-old Red Gerard won the men’s slopestyle event on Saturday. Its only other medal going into Sunday was a silver, won in luge. The U.S. was pretty far behind in the medal count, but it’s still very early on. Norway, always considered a force in the Winter Olympics, leads the total medal count with eight. That includes one gold, four silver, and three bronze medals. The Netherlands are in second, with five total medals, including two gold. Germany has the most gold medals, with three, and also has a bronze. American figure skaters were expected to be competing for gold, but in the team event, they’ve had some struggles. They are still within range, with three events to go on Sunday evening. But they are currently third in the team event standings. In the non-team events later on, America is expected to do well. The Czech Republic has two medals, like the United States, but that country has a silver and a bronze, possessing no gold. Canada is just above the United States with three silvers and a bronze, for a total of four medals. On Sunday, Perrine Laffont of France took home the gold in the women’s moguls final in freestyle skiing. Arnd Peiffer won the biathlon men’s 10km sprint for Germany. Sven Kramer won the men’s 5,000m in speed skating for the Netherlands. David Gleirscher won gold in the men’s singles luge for Austria. Finally, Simen Hegstad Krueger won the men’s 30km skiathlon for Norway. Upcoming medals for Sunday and Monday On Sunday evening, the figure skating team event will hand out medals when the men’s and women’s free skate and the ice dancing free program happen, with an expected end time of around 11 p.m. ET. That all gets started on NBC at 8 p.m. ET. The women’s slopestyle final will also take place on Sunday evening, also in primetime on NBC. The qualifying was canceled due to strong winds. The same can be said for the women’s alpine skiing giant slalom, which is scheduled to give out a medal with the second runs beginning at 11:45 p.m., though with the first heats also postponed due to heavy winds, it’s unclear at the time of writing if this will take place. Early in the morning on Monday, at least in the United States, medals will awarded in the women’s 10km pursuit and men’s 12.5km pursuit in the sport of biathlon. The men’s moguls final in freestyle skiing, women’s 1,500m in speedskating, women’s individual normal hill final in ski jumping, and the women’s halfpipe final in snowboarding will all have medals on Monday as well.
