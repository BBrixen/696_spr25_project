The model generates short video clips based on user prompts , and can also extend existing short videos. Sora was released publicly for ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Pro users in December 2024. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] History [ edit ] Several other text-to-video generating models had been created prior to Sora, including Meta 's Make-A-Video, Runway 's Gen-2, and Google 's Lumiere, the last of which, as of February 2024, [update] is also still in its research phase. [ 3 ] OpenAI , the company behind Sora, had released DALL·E 3 , the third of its DALL-E text-to-image models , in September 2023. [ 4 ] The team that developed Sora named it after the Japanese word for sky to signify its "limitless creative potential". [ 5 ] On February 15, 2024, OpenAI first previewed Sora by releasing multiple clips of high-definition videos that it created, including an SUV driving down a mountain road, an animation of a "short fluffy monster" next to a candle, two people walking through Tokyo in the snow, and fake historical footage of the California gold rush , and stated that it was able to generate videos up to one minute long. [ 3 ] The company then shared a technical report, which highlighted the methods used to train the model. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also posted a series of tweets, responding to Twitter users' prompts with Sora-generated videos of the prompts. In November 2024, an API key for Sora access was leaked by a group of testers on Hugging Face , who posted a manifesto stating that they were protesting that Sora was used for " art washing ". OpenAI revoked all access three hours after the leak was made public, and gave a statement that "hundreds of artists" have shaped the development, and that "participation is voluntary." [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] As of December 9, 2024, OpenAI has made Sora available to the public, for ChatGPT Pro and ChatGPT Plus users. Prior to this, the company had provided limited access to a small " red team ", including experts in misinformation and bias, to perform adversarial testing on the model. [ 4 ] The company also shared Sora with a small group of creative professionals, including video makers and artists, to seek feedback on its usefulness in creative fields. [ 11 ] In February 2025, OpenAI announced plans to integrate Sora into ChatGPT by letting users generate Sora videos from the chatbot. [ 12 ] Capabilities and limitations [ edit ] A video generated by Sora of someone lying in a bed with a cat on it, containing several mistakes The technology behind Sora is an adaptation of the technology behind DALL-E 3 . According to OpenAI, Sora is a diffusion transformer [ 13 ] – a denoising latent diffusion model with one Transformer as the denoiser. A video is generated in latent space by denoising 3D "patches", then transformed to standard space by a video decompressor. Re-captioning is used to augment training data , by using a video-to-text model to create detailed captions on videos. [ 7 ] OpenAI trained the model using publicly available videos as well as copyrighted videos licensed for the purpose, but did not reveal the number or the exact source of the videos. [ 5 ] Upon its release, OpenAI acknowledged some of Sora's shortcomings, including its struggling to simulate complex physics, to understand causality , and to differentiate left from right. [ 14 ] One example shows a group of wolf pups seemingly multiplying and converging, creating a hard-to-follow scenario. [ 15 ] OpenAI also stated that, in adherence to the company's existing safety practices, Sora will restrict text prompts for sexual, violent, hateful, or celebrity imagery, as well as content featuring pre-existing intellectual property . [ 4 ] Tim Brooks, a researcher on Sora, stated that the model figured out how to create 3D graphics from its dataset alone, while Bill Peebles, also a Sora researcher, said that the model automatically created different video angles without being prompted. [ 3 ] According to OpenAI, Sora-generated videos are tagged with C2PA metadata to indicate that they were AI-generated. [ 5 ] Reception [ edit ] Will Douglas Heaven of the MIT Technology Review called the demonstration videos "impressive", but noted that they must have been cherry-picked and may not be representative of Sora's typical output. [ 11 ] American academic Oren Etzioni expressed concerns over the technology's ability to create online disinformation for political campaigns. [ 5 ] For Wired , Steven Levy similarly wrote that it had the potential to become "a misinformation train wreck" and opined that its preview clips were "impressive" but "not perfect" and that it "show[ed] an emergent grasp of cinematic grammar" due to its unprompted shot changes. Levy added, "[i]t will be a very long time, if ever, before text-to-video threatens actual filmmaking." [ 3 ] Lisa Lacy of CNET called its example videos "remarkably realistic – except perhaps when a human face appears close up or when sea creatures are swimming". [ 4 ] Filmmaker Tyler Perry announced he would be putting a planned $800 million expansion of his Atlanta studio on hold, expressing concern about Sora's potential impact on the film industry.
