From left to right: Adéwalé, Ratonhnhaké:ton (Connor) , Arno Dorian , Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad , Evie Frye , Bayek , Kassandra, Alexios , Aya, Jacob Frye , Ezio Auditore , Edward Kenway , Aveline de Grandpré , and Shay Cormac . The Assassin's Creed media franchise, which primarily consists of a series of open-world action-adventure stealth video games published by Ubisoft , features an extensive cast of characters in its historical fiction and science fiction -based narratives. The series also encompasses a wide variety of media outside of video games, including novels, comic books, board games, animated films, a live-action film , and an upcoming Netflix television series. The series features original characters intertwined with real-world historical events and figures , and is centered on a fictional millennia-old struggle for peace between the Assassin Brotherhood, inspired by the real-life Order of Assassins , who fight for peace and free will and embody the concept of chaos; and the Templar Order , inspired by the real-life Knights Templar , who desire peace through control over all of humanity, and embody the concept of order. A convention established by the first game involves the player experiencing the lives of these characters as part of a simulation played by a protagonist from the modern day, using technology known as the Animus developed by Abstergo Industries, a corporate front of the Templar Order in the modern era. The first five games feature modern-day protagonist Desmond Miles , a direct descendant of their respective lead characters who are members of familial lines that had sworn an allegiance to the Assassins. By exploring his ancestors' memories, Desmond searches for powerful artifacts called "Pieces of Eden", which are connected to the Isu, a precursor race that created humanity to serve them and went extinct following a catastrophic event tens-of-thousands of years ago. However, they left behind clues to guide humanity to their technology, which could be used to prevent the same disaster from happening in the future. Following the events of Assassin's Creed III , Abstergo develops a more advanced version of the Animus technology called the Helix, which can explore the genetic memories of any historical individual using their DNA without relying on the user being a direct descendant of them. From Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag to Assassin's Creed Syndicate , the player assumes control of unnamed research analysts working for the entertainment branch of Abstergo or the Assassin Brotherhood; the analysts are intended to be the embodiment of the player in the Assassin's Creed universe. [ 1 ] From Assassin's Creed Origins to Assassin's Creed Valhalla , the modern-day protagonist is Layla Hassan, an ambitious former Abstergo employee who developed a portable version of Animus technology and is eventually recruited to the Brotherhood. This article describes major historical and fictional characters that appear in the video games and the 2016 live-action film adaptation . Most games tend to feature standalone or self-contained stories told within a fictionalized version of real-world historical civilizations, with at least one lead character from that setting and time period. However, some games are more interconnected than others, as is the case with the "Ezio Trilogy", consisting of Assassin's Creed II , Brotherhood , and Revelations . These games feature interconnected characters and plot points, so to avoid listing a character multiple times, this article organizes character by their first or most significant appearance and describes their entire history there. Modern-day characters [ edit ] Desmond Miles saga [ edit ] Desmond Miles [ edit ] Fictional character Desmond Miles Assassin's Creed character First game Assassin's Creed (2007) Created by Ubisoft Montreal Voiced by Nolan North Motion capture Francisco Randez In-universe information Alias The Reader Significant other Unnamed lover Children Elijah (son) Relatives William Miles (father) Unnamed mother Adam (ancestor) Aquilus (ancestor) Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad (ancestor) Ezio Auditore da Firenze (ancestor) Edward Kenway (ancestor) Haytham Kenway (ancestor) Ratonhnhaké:ton / Connor (ancestor) Origin Black Hills , South Dakota , United States Nationality American Desmond Miles (13 March 1987 – 21 December 2012) is a fictional character from Ubisoft 's Assassin's Creed video game series. He is the protagonist of five Assassin's Creed installments, with his journey uniting the frame story of the first five installments. [ 2 ] Desmond has also appeared in smaller capacity in subsequent games in the series, as well as various spin-off media. He is voiced by actor Nolan North , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and modeled after Canadian fashion model Francisco Randez. [ 5 ] According to several video game journalists and authors, Desmond's character is meant to represent a form of transcendence symbolically from the necessity of the human body . [ 2 ] In the franchise, Desmond is a descendant of a long line of important characters, including Adam , [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Aquilus, [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad , [ 11 ] Ezio Auditore da Firenze , [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Edward Kenway , [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Haytham Kenway , [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] and Ratonhnhaké:ton / Connor , most of whom were members of the Assassin Brotherhood, a fictional organization inspired by the real-life Order of Assassins that is dedicated to safeguarding peace and freedom. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Born into the Brotherhood, Desmond is trained as an Assassin  from a young age, but his desire to lead a normal life eventually prompts him to run away from home and cut ties with the Assassins. However, he is eventually kidnapped by the Templar Order , the Assassins' mortal enemies, who force him into a machine called the Animus that allows Desmond to experience the genetic memories of his ancestors. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] In doing so, the Templars hope to locate powerful artifacts called Pieces of Eden and enslave all of humanity. Desmond manages to escape and, after accepting his Assassin heritage, rejoins the Brotherhood to help them stop the Templars. In the process, he learns that he is destined to save humanity from an impending solar flare , and continues to explore his ancestors' memories to find the technology of a precursor race called the Isu , who were wiped out by a similar disaster. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Critical reception of the character has been mixed. Many reviewers and video game journalists criticized Desmond as a dull and uninteresting protagonist, whose story arc does not match the quality of the historical plots featured in each of the games, though more positive commentary focused on North's performance and Desmond's character development. The decision to have Desmond killed off in Assassin's Creed III also proved controversial, as both critics and players noticed a significant decrease in the importance of the series' modern-day storyline after his death. Nevertheless, Desmond is considered to be a significant part of the franchise's identity. [ 27 ] Creation and development [ edit ] According to his voice actor Nolan North , the original plan for Desmond was that he would feature in six games, acquiring the skills of his Assassin ancestors to become "The Ultimate Assassin", [ 28 ] and at some point would be able to time-travel between different time periods. North became greatly interested in the concept but was scrapped. Adding upon this, North commented that he saw Desmond as a boring protagonist who ultimately had no direction to go forward, describing the character as "a fork in the road". Desmond has been defined as a MacGuffin , namely that "he exists to move the story forward, but he provides little substance." [ 2 ] Following the release of Assassin's Creed III and the conclusion of Desmond's storyline, lead designer Steve Master said: "What we're trying to do is bring some finality to Desmond's story. To actually wrap up what you've opened and experienced with him." Jean Guesdon, the creative director of the series, later said that Desmond is an important character in the Assassin's Creed series, and that despite his death, he would continue to play an important role in the franchise. [ 29 ] In 2016, Michael Fassbender starred in and co-produced a film adaptation of the series, titled Assassin's Creed . [ 30 ] Initially thought to be cast as Desmond, Ubisoft later stated that Fassbender would play a new character, named Callum "Cal" Lynch. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Appearances [ edit ] In the original Assassin's Creed , Desmond is introduced as a former Assassin leading a simple life as a bartender in New York City . [ 2 ] In order to hide his identity, he lives under assumed names and uses only cash to protect himself. Despite this, he is eventually tracked down and captured by Abstergo Industries , a company used as a front by the modern-day Templar Order. [ 2 ] Once inside Abstergo's facility in Rome , Desmond is forced to enter the Animus, a machine that allows him to relive the memories of his ancestors stored in his DNA . [ 2 ] The Animus translates these memories into a three-dimensional environment, where Desmond retains some degree of control, but must remain synchronized with his ancestors' exact actions at any given moment or else he risks being kicked out of the Animus. [ 2 ] Under the watch of Abstergo's lead scientist, Dr. Warren Vidic , and his assistant Lucy Stillman , Desmond is instructed to relive the memories of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad (1165–1257; Syria ), to help Abstergo find specific information they are looking for, which Vidic refuses to disclose. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] After recovering the information sought by Abstergo—a map showing the locations of various Pieces of Eden, ancient artifacts of great power created by a Precursor race—Vidic's superiors order Desmond to be killed. Lucy's quick thinking saves him, as she persuades Vidic to keep him alive until they know he is of no further use. Upon returning to his room, Desmond, suffering from the "Bleeding Effect" due to prolonged exposure to the Animus, discovers he has gained one of Altaïr's abilities: Eagle Vision. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] This allows him to discern friend from foe and to read cryptic messages written on walls and floors by Subject 16, the previous Animus test subject that Lucy and Vidic occasionally mention. [ 25 ] Assassin's Creed II continues from where the first game left off, as Desmond escapes from the Abstergo facility with the help of Lucy, revealed to be an undercover Assassin. After being taken to the Assassins' hideout, Desmond meets the rest of Lucy's team—historian Shaun Hastings and technician Rebecca Crane —and enters the Animus 2.0, built by Rebecca, to be quickly trained as an Assassin via the Bleeding Effect. Desmond begins reliving the memories of Ezio Auditore da Firenze (1459–1524; Italy ), his ancestor from the Renaissance , in order to graft his skills and abilities onto himself. [ 38 ] After successfully navigating Ezio's early memories, Desmond is extracted from the Animus to avoid the mental degradation that Subject 16 suffered as a consequence of the Bleeding Effect. Soon after, Desmond involuntarily relives a memory of Altaïr while outside of the Animus, as a result of the Bleeding Effect. [ 25 ] After spending more time in Animus 2.0, Desmond begins to adjust to his newly developed skills and becomes a master freerunner and expert fighter, just like his ancestors. The last segment of Ezio's memories brings an astonished Ezio and Desmond to a futuristic chamber underneath the Sistine Chapel , where they are met by a hologram of Minerva , a member of the Precursor race known as the Isu that created humanity and the Pieces of Eden. Minerva addresses Desmond by name, knowing that he is reliving Ezio's memories, and talks about a cataclysm which wiped out most of her race thousands of years ago, and which is set to occur again by the end of that year , if Desmond does not prevent it. Desmond is then pulled from the Animus as Abstergo discovers the Assassins' hideout, forcing the team to escape to a new hideout. [ 25 ] In Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood , Desmond, Lucy, Shaun, and Rebecca arrive at Monteriggioni , where they set up a safe house in the Villa Auditore 's sanctuary. Desmond re-enters the Animus 2.0 to continue reliving Ezio's memories and discover what he did with the Apple of Eden he had obtained, hoping to use the artifact to defeat the Templars and stop the cataclysm Minerva warned him about. After learning Ezio hid the Apple under the Colosseum , Desmond and the other Assassins head there to retrieve it. Desmond takes the Apple, but through it another Isu named Juno takes control of his body and forces him to stab Lucy, saying that she would have betrayed him if he allowed her to accompany him any further. Desmond then falls into a coma and is placed back into the Animus by two unknown Assassins in a bid to preserve his consciousness. [ 25 ] In Assassin's Creed: Revelations , Desmond awakens within the Black Room, a safe mode area for the Animus. In the Black Room's Animus Island, he meets the digital construct of Subject 16, Clay Kaczmarek , who tells Desmond that he must find a "Synch Nexus", a memory that links him with Altaïr and Ezio, so that the Animus can reintegrate his shattered subconscious and awaken him from his coma. While in this state, Desmond can hear conversations between Shaun, Rebecca, and his father, William Miles , who are concerned about his state, and access five memory sequences that detail his own life prior to his abduction by Abstergo. In these sequences, Desmond reminisces of his time on "the Farm", where he grew up in secrecy among other Assassins, and his father's harsh training, which prompted him to run away on his 16th birthday, due to not wanting to live the life his parents had chosen for him. Eventually, he moved to New York, where he got a job at a high-end bar, but always regretted not being able to properly say goodbye to his parents. Following his abduction, he blamed himself for not taking his parents' warnings and training more seriously. In the present, Desmond realizes that his easiest days are now behind him and finally accepts his role as an Assassin. [ 25 ] When the Animus begins to delete Animus Island to get rid of excess data. Clay sacrifices himself to prevent Desmond from being deleted, but not before transferring his own genetic memories onto him. Eventually, Desmond is able to reach the Synch Nexus, which allows him to communicate with the Isu Jupiter , who directs him to find the Grand Temple so that he may use the technology inside to save humanity from the solar flare set to hit the Earth in several weeks. Following this, Desmond awakens from his coma to find Shaun, Rebecca, and William next to him, and simply states that he knows what they have to do. [ 39 ] The Lost Archive downloadable content for Revelations expands upon Desmond's time in the Black Room, as he involuntarily experiences Clay's memories prior to the latter's death. Through these memories, he learns that Lucy was in fact a double agent for the Templars, and that his escape from Abstergo was staged as part of "Project Siren." In reality, Vidic had ordered Lucy to extract Desmond to a place where he would feel safe so that he would willingly enter the Animus and facilitate the search for Ezio's Apple of Eden, which Abstergo planned to send to space via satellite in an effort to enslave humanity. However, this plan came to a halt when Juno forced Desmond to kill Lucy. [ 25 ] In Assassin's Creed III , Desmond arrives at the Grand Temple, located in a cave system in New York , and accesses it using Ezio's Apple of Eden. With the help of his father and friends, Desmond relives the memories of his ancestors Haytham Kenway (1725–1781; Kingdom of Great Britain ) and Ratonhnhaké:ton / Connor (1756–unknown; Colonial America ) using the new Animus 3.0, [ 2 ] hoping to find the Key to the Temple's Central Vault, where the solution to stopping the solar flare is located. During his breaks in-between Animus sessions, Desmond explores the Temple and speaks with Juno, who tells him more of her race's history and their failed attempts to survive the Great Catastrophe. The Assassins also search for Isu batteries to power the Grand Temple and allow them to access the Central Vault, with Desmond being sent to retrieve them due to his superior skills. Desmond successfully retrieves two batteries from Manhattan and São Paulo , where he has run-ins with the Templar Daniel Cross , dispatched by Abstergo to capture him. As the date of the solar flare approaches, William volunteers to retrieve the final battery so Desmond can locate the Key, but is captured by Abstergo and taken to their Rome facility in an attempt to get Desmond to surrender his Apple of Eden. Instead, Desmond storms the facility to rescue his father, killing Cross and Warren Vidic and reconciling with William in the process. [ 25 ] After retrieving the Key, Desmond and his allies enter the Central Vault, discovering a pedestal. The holograms of Minerva and Juno then appear, with the former warning Desmond not to touch the pedestal, as it would kill him and release Juno, who was imprisoned in the Temple to prevent her from conquering humanity. In response, Juno shows Desmond a vision of what will happen if the solar flare hits the Earth: although Desmond will become a messiah -like figure to other survivors and will be revered as a god after his death, future generations will manipulate his legacy for their personal gain. After several moments of consideration, Desmond decides to release Juno, believing humanity has a better chance at fighting her than rebuilding society after the solar flare. As the others leave the Temple, Desmond touches the pedestal, which frees Juno and activates a protective shield around the Earth that stops the solar flare, at the cost of his own life. [ 25 ] Despite his death, Desmond remains a powerful asset for the Templars and Assassins in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag . Shortly after his death, an Abstergo recovery team was sent to collect samples from his body for their new Sample 17 Project. His DNA is stored in Abstergo Entertainment's servers, where a crew of analysts is tasked with reliving his copied genetic memories and learning about his ancestors. One of them, the player character , is tasked with reliving the memories of Edward Kenway (1693–1735; Wales ), Haytham Kenway's father and Connor's grandfather. While this is ostensibly to gather data for a feature film about Edward's life, in reality Abstergo seeks to find the Observatory, an Isu site hosting an advanced tracking device and several vials of Isu blood samples. [ 25 ] During their research, the player character steals and sends back to the Assassins several recordings left by Desmond detailing his initial doubts of leaving the Farm, his acceptance of the role he had been chosen to play, and his love for his parents. Because Abstergo can now collect anyone's genetic memories without having to use blood-related analysts, his body gives Abstergo full knowledge about his family life. [ 25 ] In 2015, during the events of Assassin's Creed Syndicate , a boy named Elijah is brought by his mother to an Abstergo clinic in New York City. Abstergo analysts discover that the boy shares exactly the same patrilineal lineage of Desmond, indicating that he may have been unknowingly conceived by him a few years after his escape from the Farm. On top of that, it is also revealed that the boy is a Sage, the reincarnation of a member of the Isu species. An Abstergo researcher proposes to kidnap the boy and conduct vivisection on him. Another researcher, Isabelle Ardant , opposes the idea, stating that it would be better to abduct the boy when he is older and place him in the Animus for 50 years so that Abstergo can study his lineage. [ 25 ] In Assassin's Creed Valhalla , it is revealed that when Desmond sacrificed himself to save the Earth, only his physical form was killed, as his consciousness was transported into a computer simulation created by the Isu known as "The Grey." During his time there, Desmond forgot his original identity and was transformed into a being of pure light called The Reader , whose task is to analyze various branching timelines to determine ways of preventing future cataclysms. In 2020, the Assassin Layla Hassan enters the Grey in an attempt to slow the magnetism of the global aurora borealis device, which was activated by Desmond when he died. Here, Layla meets the Reader and shows him more possibilities and calculations based on timelines he had not explored. Layla then decides to stay in the Grey and help the Reader explore more timelines, allowing her mortal body to die. [ 26 ] Additionally, the player can find and listen to two audio logs of Desmond on Layla's computer, recorded shortly before his death. In the first, he talks about his life as an Assassin and his lack of choice in the matter, which he finds ironic given the Brotherhood's advocation for free will . He also expresses his belief that the Assassins have become more dogmatic and stagnant in time, as most have stopped thinking about the actual meaning of the Creed; despite this, he still believes in the Assassins' cause and considers that people sometimes need limitations. In the second log, Desmond talks about his ancestors and how he feels overwhelmed after having relived so many different lives in a short time span, as well as how he doesn't consider himself special for being descended from the Isu, believing that anyone can join the Assassins and make a difference in the world. [ 26 ] Reception and analysis [ edit ] Desmond received mixed reviews from critics, [ 40 ] primarily due to his uneven characterization and development. [ 41 ] He was voted the 20th top character of the 2000s by Game Informer readers. [ 42 ] PlayStation Universe rated him as one of the PlayStation 3 's worst characters, saying: "While voiced admirably by the ubiquitous Nolan North, it's impossible to shake the feeling of pure monotony when stepping into Desmond's shoes when all you want to do is hop back in time and stab people in the face." [ 43 ] The significance of Desmond as an atypical video game protagonist and as a character study on posthumanism is analyzed by Aubrie Adams in the 2017 publication 100 Greatest Video Game Characters . [ 2 ] Adams commented that as his mind travel through time and experiences the memories of his ancestors, aided by the technological innovations of science fiction plot devices like the Animus, his body appears to have become increasingly unnecessary throughout the franchise. From this view, the technology that enables him to transcend the biological limitations of his frail body taps into a cultural zeitgeist that desire the idea of extending life throughout technology. [ 44 ] Adams cited the character's continued presence in the storylines of later games in spite of his apparent death in Assassin's Creed III , along with fan theories and official in-game lore which confirm the persistence of his consciousness in the virtual environment, which is indicative of his conclusive change into a posthuman character who transcended his trivial need for a physical form. [ 45 ] Adams highlighted the significance of the introduction of Desmond as a character during a time period when white hypermasculine player characters were the norm in the video game industry, emphasizing in particular his depiction as a subdued protagonist who is psychologically complex, and of an ambiguous ethnicity as the result of his diverse ancestral heritage. [ 44 ] The story arc in the early Assassin's Creed titles centered around Desmond, where his identity gradually evolves from a blank state who subsumes the characteristics and skills of others into a highly skilled Master Assassin, is also marked by his evolving individuality as he comes to terms with his shifting personal identity and acceptance that he is part of a lineage that is bigger than the sum of its parts. [ 44 ] Adams commented that there is a compelling depth to Desmond as character but only if players are willing to engage in the largely optional experiences that follow his psychological journey and illuminate the details of his past. [ 45 ] Lucy Stillman [ edit ] Lucy Stillman (1988 – 10 October 2012) (voiced by Kristen Bell ) [ 46 ] is a member of the modern-day Assassin Brotherhood and genetic memory researcher for Abstergo Industries' Animus Project. During her infiltration of Abstergo, she reports on the company's recent activities to the Assassins. However, Lucy's lengthy separation from the Assassins and her distrust for William Miles leads her to defect to the Templar cause prior to 2011. When Desmond Miles is brought into Abstergo for testing, Warren instructs Lucy to earn Desmond's trust so that the Templars can find the Piece of Eden located within his memories and use it for their Eye-Abstergo satellite. As Desmond's condition begins to worsen, Warren and Lucy resort to more drastic measures, and formulate Project Siren. Lucy is ordered to take Desmond somewhere he would feel safe, and the two Templars orchestrate Desmond and her escape from Abstergo. Lucy carries out her orders and relocates Desmond to a hideout to join his fellow Assassins Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane. After a month and another relocation to the ruined Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni , the Assassin team discovers the location of an Apple of Eden, which is inside the Colosseum Vault. When Desmond's hand makes contact with the Apple, his body is possessed by the Isu Juno. With her knowledge of Lucy's true allegiance, Juno forces Desmond to stab and kill Lucy with his Hidden Blade. Desmond would later learn of Lucy's betrayal while involuntarily reliving the memories of Clay Kaczmarek, Subject 16 of the Animus Project. Warren Vidic [ edit ] Dr. Warren Vidic (died 14 December 2012) (voiced by Philip Proctor ) [ 46 ] is the head of the Abstergo's Animus project and a member of the Inner Sanctum of the Templar Order. In Assassin's Creed: Bloodstone , he is introduced to Abstergo Industries by William King Harvey , a CIA director and double agent for the Templar Order. He inherits the Bluebird project from Colonel Boris Pash , which is the precursor of the Animus project. As the head of research for Abstergo, Vidic is put in charge of the genetic memory research and the Animus project. As the one responsible for finding new subjects for the Animus, Warren has them explore their genetic memories, which he would then analyze to gain information on both the Assassins and the Pieces of Eden. As a high-ranking employee of Abstergo Industries, Warren is also one of the few members of the Inner Sanctum, a group of Templars with full awareness of the Orders' plans for their "New World". He plays an important role in those plans, being tasked with finding a Piece of Eden to power Eye-Abstergo, a satellite which uses the Piece of Eden's power to control humanity. In Assassin's Creed , Vidic experiments on Desmond Miles with the Animus, forcing him to relive the memories of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad so that Abstergo can obtain a map showing the locations of countless Pieces of Eden around the globe. Following Desmond's escape from Abstergo in Assassin's Creed II , Vidic leads several agents to attack the Assassins' hideout in an attempt to re-capture him, though this attack fails and Vidic is forced to flee. Afterwards, he shifts his focus to overseeing the training of a number of Templar agents through the Animus, as seen in the multiplayer modes in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed: Revelations . In Assassin's Creed III , after capturing William Miles, Vidic is killed by Desmond when the latter storms Abstergo's Rome facility to rescue his father. In Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag , an e-mail sent by Abstergo Entertainment COO Olivier Garneau reveals that Warren had volunteered as Subject 2 for his Animus Project, where he relived the life of an ancestor in 18th-century Hungary and of one of Joan of Arc 's executioners in 1431. Shaun Hastings [ edit ] Shaun Hastings (born 1985) (voiced by Danny Wallace ) [ 47 ] is a cynical, condescending, and pessimistic member of the modern-day Assassin Brotherhood, specializing in research and information handling. He is introduced as a member of Lucy Stillman's team that helps Desmond in his mission to find Pieces of Eden and save the world. Through conversations in Assassin's Creed II , Desmond learns that Shaun was interested in conspiracies from an early age, and developed a love of history. Although he was unaware of the existence of modern-day Templars and Assassins, Shaun realized that there was some sort of power struggle going on. Shaun attempted to tell others about his findings, not realizing that the Templars would try to silence him. Rebecca Crane "rescued" Shaun and recruited him into the Brotherhood. This is mentioned as being unconventional, as most Assassins are born into the Order, not recruited. In 2013, following Desmond's death, Shaun infiltrates Abstergo by working as a coffee vendor at their Entertainment subsidiary in Montreal to find out what happened to Desmond's body. A year later, Shaun (under the alias " Deacon ") and Bishop enlist the help of a Helix player to locate the remains of a Sage during the French Revolution . In 2015, with the help of the same player, Shaun and Rebecca infiltrate Abstergo's London headquarters and locate the Shroud of Eden hidden in a vault underneath the city, but lose it to the Templars after a struggle. In 2020, Shaun and Rebecca are assigned to work with Layla Hassan in investigating the strange strengthening of Earth's magnetic field , and later meet Basim Ibn Ishaq, whom they put in contact with William Miles. Rebecca Crane [ edit ] Rebecca Crane (born 1984)  (voiced by Eliza Schneider ) [ 48 ] is a member of the modern-day Assassin Brotherhood and the creator of the Animus 2.0, which she affectionately refers to as "Baby". She is introduced in Assassin's Creed II as a member of Lucy Stillman's team and works with Desmond towards finding Pieces of Eden and saving the world. She provides technical support for the other members of the Brotherhood alongside her fellow Assassin, Shaun. After Desmond's death, Rebecca works with Shaun to infiltrate Abstergo Entertainment as a courier. In 2015, Rebecca and Shaun head to London with fellow Assassin Galina Voronina to locate and extract the Shroud of Eden. Their efforts fail, and Rebecca is wounded when she takes a shot meant for Shaun. The trio manages to escape after Galina dispatches most of the Abstergo agents surrounding them. In 2020, Rebecca and Shaun are assigned to work with Layla Hassan in investigating the strange strengthening of Earth's magnetic field , and later meet Basim Ibn Ishaq, whom they put in contact with William Miles. William Miles [ edit ] William Miles (born 1948)  (voiced by John de Lancie ) is Desmond's estranged father and de facto leader of the modern-day Assassin Brotherhood, having risen to the position following the death of the previous Mentor in 2000. He raised Desmond in the ways of the Assassins, teaching him about the order and what they fight for. William's first appearance is in the ending scene of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood , where he can be heard telling his fellow Assassins to put Desmond in the Animus to save his mind after the latter has fallen into a coma. In Assassin's Creed: Revelations , he can be heard talking with Rebecca and Shaun during Desmond's time in the Animus Black Room, explaining Desmond's importance to the Assassins due to his ability to wield the Apple of Eden properly. He questions Rebecca and Shaun if Desmond and Lucy were close, and feels sad about Lucy's death. He is the first person to greet Desmond after recovering from his coma. In Assassin's Creed III , William and his team arrive at the Isu Grand Temple and search for power cells to activate it while Desmond is in the Animus, exploring his ancestors' memories to find the key to the Temple's Inner Chambers. He is captured by Abstergo agents in Egypt while attempting to retrieve a power cell and is taken to their facility in Rome. Desmond infiltrates the facility and rescues William, reconciling with him in the process. Following Desmond's death, a grief-stricken William retires from the position of Mentor of the Brotherhood and goes into hiding, but eventually reclaims the title in 2015. In Assassin's Creed Origins , William travels to Egypt to recruit Layla Hassan to the Assassins. In Assassin's Creed Valhalla , William meets Basim Ibn Ishaq at the latter's request and agrees to work with him to further the Assassins' goals, though not before demanding a sample of Basim's genetic material, to allow the Assassins to observe Basim's genetic memories and be convinced of his motives. Clay Kaczmarek (Subject 16) [ edit ] Clay Kaczmarek (1982 – 8 August 2012) (voiced by Cam Clarke in Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and by Graham Cuthbertson in Assassin's Creed: Revelations ), also known as Subject 16 of the Animus Project, is a member of the modern-day Assassin Brotherhood and descendant of Ezio Auditore da Firenze . Born into a family of engineers, Clay faces psychological problems due to developmental disorders and his father's neglectful attitude, and runs into the Assassins while looking for acceptance. As a member of the Brotherhood, Clay's most important mission is to infiltrate Abstergo Industries as a subject of the Animus Project to obtain more information on the Animus. Labeled Subject 16, Clay is forced to relive the memories of his ancestors via his genetic memory. When Clay finds out that his teammate, Lucy Stillman—who infiltrated Abstergo years before and was tasked with getting Clay out of Abstergo safely—had abandoned their cause to join their enemies, the Templars, Clay spends days and hours of sessions inside the Animus. Since it leaves his mind incapable of separating his own personality from those of his ancestors, Clay becomes mentally unstable to the point that he commits suicide. After his alleged death, Clay continues to exist as an AI recreation of his personality within the Animus, and is able to manipulate much of the Animus' programming from within to help Desmond. In Assassin's Creed: Revelations , when the Animus begins to delete excess data after Desmond achieves full synchronization with Altaïr and Ezio, Clay sacrifices himself to help Desmond escape the Animus, though not before passing on his genetic memories to him. Daniel Cross [ edit ] Daniel Cross (9 March 1974 – 14 December 2012) (voiced by Danny Blanco-Hall) is a member of the Templar Order and a sleeper agent tasked with infiltrating the Assassin Brotherhood to assassinate its Mentor. He is the grandson of Innokenti Orelov and the great-grandson of Nikolai Orelov, a prominent member of the Russian Assassin Brotherhood.

He is introduced as the modern-day protagonist of the comic book series Assassin's Creed: The Fall , and makes his first on-screen appearance in Assassin's Creed III , where he is assigned the task of hunting down Desmond Miles. Cross is ultimately killed by Desmond when the latter storms Abstergo's Rome facility to rescue his father. Research analyst / Helix player saga [ edit ] Erudito [ edit ] Erudito is a hacking collective that works against Abstergo Industries, being aware of its true nature. The collective's primary goal is to expose the truths censored by Abstergo in its products, to make the general public aware of the Assassin-Templar conflict. This can be seen in Assassin's Creed III: Liberation , where they contact the unnamed player character during their playthrough of Abstergo's newest video game, Liberation , and help them uncensor it. Because of their similar goals, Erudito would at times work with the Assassins against the Templars. Abstergo research analyst [ edit ] The Abstergo research analyst , nicknamed " Noob ", is the modern-day protagonist of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag . They are never seen or referred to by name, being controlled from a first-person perspective . In 2013, the analyst is hired by Abstergo Entertainment, a subsidiary of Abstergo Industries that produces multimedia goods to be sold to the general public, and is assigned to work on the Sample 17 Project, consisting of various products based on the genetic memories of the late Desmond Miles' ancestors. The analyst relives the memories of Edward Kenway to collect footage for an upcoming interactive film , but during their work, they are contacted by John Standish, who persuades them to investigate Abstergo and recover sensitive information on the company, which is then delivered to Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane to help the Assassins. Although the analyst soon becomes suspicious of John's motives, they are blackmailed into pushing forward, eventually hacking a terminal which would allow Juno to come back to life by possessing someone. However, Juno is not strong enough yet to possess the analyst, so John tries to weaken them with poison, but is killed by Abstergo's security forces before he could do so. The analyst is then allowed to return to work, as evidence found on John's computer implicated him as the sole person responsible for the hacks. However, they would eventually resign by November 2014. Helix research analyst [ edit ] The Helix research analyst , nicknamed " Numbskull ", is the modern-day protagonist of Assassin's Creed Rogue . Similarly to the analyst from Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag , they are never seen or referred to by name, and are controlled from a first-person perspective. In 2014, they are hired by Abstergo Entertainment to use their Helix software to relive the memories of Shay Patrick Cormac , but inadvertently trips a hidden memory file that infects the Animus servers. After cleaning them, the analyst is thanked for their services, and invited to join the Templar Order, or be killed to keep the order's existence secret; their decision is not revealed. Helix player / The Initiate [ edit ] The Helix player , referred to as " The Initiate " after their induction into the Assassin Brotherhood, is the modern-day protagonist of Assassin's Creed Unity and Assassin's Creed Syndicate . They are an individual contacted by the Assassins through their agent, Bishop, to help them on at least two separate occasions: once in 2014, when they located the body of François-Thomas Germain , an 18th-century Sage, by reliving the memories of Arno Dorian through the Helix software they own; and again in 2015, when they relived Jacob and Evie Frye 's memories to find the Shroud of Eden in London.

Later, while en route to a shareholders meeting in Chicago , he goes missing and is never heard from again. In Assassin's Creed Origins , it is revealed that he was killed by a fixer , likely hired by the Assassin Brotherhood. John Standish [ edit ] John Standish (16 August 1975 – 26 November 2013) (voiced by Oliver Milburn ) is the head of the IT department at Abstergo Entertainment's Montreal facility and a member of the Instruments of the First Will, a cult of followers of Juno who seek to bring her back to life. He is also a Sage, the reincarnation of Juno's husband Aita . During his work at Abstergo, he uses other employees, to whom he grants access to restricted areas of the company, to retrieve sensitive information and deliver it to the Assassins, while covering his own involvement. In 2013, during the events of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag , he does the same with the newly hired research analyst, but also secretly plots to have them possessed by Juno. However, when it comes time to put his plan into action, he discovers Juno is not strong enough to return yet. John then tries to poison the analyst to make them weak enough for Juno to enter their body, but is shot and killed by Abstergo's security forces.

Historical characters [ edit ] Characters of Assassin's Creed [ edit ] Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad [ edit ] Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad (11 January 1165 – 12 August 1257) (voiced by Philip Shahbaz in Assassin's Creed , [ 46 ] and by Cas Anvar in Assassin's Creed: Revelations ) [ 50 ] is the protagonist of Assassin's Creed , the spin-off games Assassin's Creed: Altaïr's Chronicles and Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines , and the novel Assassin's Creed: The Secret Crusade , as well as the secondary protagonist of Assassin's Creed: Revelations . He has also made appearances or been mentioned in several other games and spin-off media of the franchise, being a legendary figure in the history of the Assassin Brotherhood. Altaïr is a Syrian -born member of the Levantine Brotherhood of Assassins who serves as Mentor from 1191 until his death in 1257, assuming the position after killing the previous Mentor, Al Mualim , who betrayed the Assassins. During his tenure as Mentor and its brief interregnum, Altaïr makes several discoveries and inventions that greatly helps the Brotherhood's progression. Under his leadership the Levantine Assassins' spread their influence across the Old World, setting up many guilds in cities like Constantinople . With the Apple of Eden in hand, Altaïr changes the way members of the Brotherhood live their lives, writing the details in his fabled Codex for later generations of Assassins to read. Throughout his travels, Altaïr strengthens the Brotherhood, stops various Templar plots over the years, and stops Genghis Khan 's march. In 1257, Altaïr dies sitting quietly in his chair in his secret library in Masyaf, and is found centuries later, in 1512, by Ezio Auditore da Firenze . Altaïr is an ancestor to Desmond Miles through the maternal line. After completing Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time in 2003, director Patrice Désilets was instructed to begin work on the next Prince of Persia game. [ 51 ] However, he wanted to move away from the lead character being a prince simply waiting for his reign to start, onto a character that wanted to strive to be a king. He came upon one of his university books on secret societies and its material related to the Order of Assassins . Désilets recognized that he could have the lead character in the game be the second-highest Assassin , seeking to be the leader of the group. [ 52 ] The game began work under the title Prince of Persia: Assassin , [ 53 ] or Prince of Persia: Assassins , [ 52 ] inspired by Hassan-i Sabbah 's life and making heavy use of Vladimir Bartol 's novel Alamut . [ 54 ] [ 55 ] The Assassin character was fleshed out throughout the game's three-year development in an iterative fashion. The team had some idea of how the character dressed from Alamut and other historical works in all-white robes and a red belt but had to envision how to detail this in the game. One of the first concept sketches, drawn by animator Khai Nguyen, suggested the concept of a bird of prey , which resonated with the team. The Assassin was named Altaïr, meaning "bird of prey" in Arabic , and eagle imagery was used heavily in connection to the Assassins. [ 52 ] Altaïr was to be a heroic character with a bit of a badass edge, and the artist borrowed elements of the G.I. Joe character Storm Shadow , a similarly skilled hero. Rendering long flowing robes was impossible on the newer hardware, so they shortened the robe and gave it a more feathered look, resonating the bird of prey imagery. [ 52 ] Al Mualim [ edit ] Main article: Rashid ad-Din Sinan Engraving of Rashid ad-Din Sinan Rashid ad-Din Sinan (1135 – September 1191) (voiced by Peter Renaday ), [ 46 ] commonly known as Al Mualim (Arabic: "The Teacher") or The Old Man of the Mountain , is based on his real-life counterpart, the Iraqi -born Hashshashin leader in the Syrian town of Masyaf . He is the hidden main antagonist of Assassin's Creed , and also appears in Assassin's Creed: Revelations and Assassin's Creed: The Secret Crusade . Al Mualim serves as Mentor of the Levantine Brotherhood of Assassins from circa 1176 until his death in 1191. A wizened old man, he trains Altaïr as an Assassin from a young age, and raises him in the Brotherhood's castle in Masyaf after his father, Umar, is killed by the Saracens , causing Altaïr to look up to Al Mualim as a second father. At some point in his life, Al Mualim secretly betrays the Brotherhood and helps the Templars find the fabled Apple of Eden, which he seeks for himself, hoping to use its power and knowledge to bring an end to the Crusades and establish worldwide 'peace' by controlling all of humanity. In 1191, he sends Altaïr to retrieve the Apple from the Templars, but his apprentice, blinded by arrogance, breaks all three tenets of the Assassin's Creed and alerts the Templars, though his fellow Assassin, Malik Al-Sayf, manages to grab the Apple before escaping. With the Apple in his possession, Al Mualim orders Altaïr, under the pretext of him going on a journey of redemption, to assassinate all nine Templars who were involved in the search for the artifact, to cover his own involvement. Altaïr succeeds, but in the process learns of Al Mualim's betrayal, and ultimately kills his former mentor in Masyaf. Following Al Mualim's death, Altaïr claims both the Apple and the position of Mentor; a move which initially unnerves many Assassins, but Altaïr would soon prove himself to be an efficient leader, more so than Al Mualim. Maria Thorpe [ edit ] Maria Thorpe (1160 – 12 September 1228) (voiced by Eleanor Noble ) is an English noblewoman who becomes a Templar steward, and later the wife of Altaïr. As a child, Maria rejected the gender norms of her time, ultimately being disowned by her parents after annulling her arranged marriage. Seeking to fight in the Third Crusade , she disguises herself as a man and attempts to join the Templar Order. The Templar Grand Master, Robert De Sablé , sees through her ruse, but is impressed by her determination and hires her as his steward. During the events of Assassin's Creed in 1191, Robert deduces that he is Altaïr's final target, so he has Maria serve as a decoy to buy him time. Although she expected Altaïr to kill her, he spares her instead, and warns her not to follow him. After Robert is assassinated, Maria becomes obsessed with revenge. In Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines , she tracks Altaïr to Acre , but he bests her again and takes her prisoner. She escapes in an attempt to join the Templar's new leader, Armand Bouchart , but because of her failure to kill Altaïr, and her "miraculous" escape from him, he perceives her to be either incompetent or a traitor to the Order. He places a bounty on both her and Altaïr, forcing them to work together to kill Bouchart, after which Maria renounces the Templars and joins the Brotherhood. In the following years, she and Altaïr become very fond of each other and eventually marry and have two sons, Darim and Sef. In 1217, Maria joins Altaïr and Darim in a mission to Mongolia to halt the advance of Genghis Khan. While they are away, Abbas murders Sef and seizes leadership of the Assassin. Maria and Altaïr confront Abbas after they return to Masyaf in 1228, but Maria is killed in the ensuing struggle. Altaïr, deeply affected by the loss of his wife, would be haunted by her death for years to come. Malik Al-Sayf [ edit ] Malik Al-Sayf (1165 – 12 September 1228) (voiced by Haaz Sleiman ) [ 46 ] is a member of the Levantine Assassin Brotherhood in Syria during the High Middle Ages . Trained from an early age in the ways of the Brotherhood, he attains a high rank by 1191. [ 56 ] Raised to be an Assassin, Malik learns the fighting arts that strikes fear into the hearts of their enemies. He is an excellent swordsman, a devoted acolyte to the Creed, and a caring adult figure to his brother, Kadar. He is also initially a rival of Altaïr, whom he often berates for disobeying the tenets of the Assassin's Creed. In 1191, Altaïr, Malik, and Kadar go to Solomon's Temple to retrieve the Apple of Eden on the orders of Al Mualim. [ 17 ] His jealousy turns into hatred when Altaïr ignores the tenets of the Creed, endangers his companions' lives during the events of Solomon's Temple, and subsequently botches a mission, which results in Kadar's death, and the injury and subsequent amputation of Malik's arm. Malik retrieves the Templar treasure that Altaïr failed to find and delivers it to Al Mualim. No longer able to operate as an Assassin, Malik is made the bureau leader of the Jerusalem Assassins. At first he is bitter towards Altaïr, but over time forgives him and acknowledges his own fault in his brother's death. When Altaïr returns to confront Al Mualim, Malik supports him, distracting the indoctrinated Assassins while Altaïr faces Al Mualim. After Al Mualim's death, Altaïr becomes the new Mentor of the Levantine Assassins and names Malik his second-in-command. Malik is appointed as a temporary leader in Altaïr's absence, though he would soon be imprisoned by Abbas Sofian in Masyaf's dungeons for almost two years with false charges of murder. When Altaïr returns from his quest across the Middle East in 1228, Abbas has Malik executed and sends his severed head to Altaïr as a threat. Kadar Al-Sayf [ edit ] Kadar Al-Sayf (died July 1191) is the younger brother of Malik Al-Sayf and a member of the Levantine Assassin Brotherhood. [ 57 ] He is less experienced than his brother and, just like him, is a devoted follower of the Creed, although unlike him admires and deeply respects Altaïr. In 1191, Kadar accompanies Altaïr and Malik to Solomon's Temple to retrieve the Apple of Eden from the Templars. However, Altaïr inadvertently sabotages the mission due to his arrogance, and Kadar, due to his lack of swordsmanship skills, is swiftly killed by the Templars while Altaïr and Malik manage to escape with the Apple. Richard the Lionheart [ edit ] Main article: Richard I of England 19th-century portrait of Richard the Lionheart by Merry-Joseph Blondel Richard I of England (8 September 1157 – 6 April 1199) (voiced by Marcel Jeannin), commonly known as Richard the Lionheart , reigned as King of England from 1189 until his death in 1199. He is the second monarch of the House of Plantagenet , the commander of the Crusader army during the Third Crusade, and is considered a great military leader and warrior. Upon his death, he is succeeded as King of England by his younger brother, John . In Assassin's Creed , he is encountered by Altaïr during the Battle of Arsuf , where the Assassin informs Richard that his lieutenant, Robert de Sablé, intends to betray him. In response, Robert claims that Altaïr's story is a ruse to keep Richard from interfering in the Assassin's mission. Unsure on whom to believe, Richard leaves the decision in the hands of God, declaring that Robert and his Templars are to fight Altaïr in a trial by combat. Altaïr wins, and Richard accepts the Assassin's version of events. Robert de Sablé [ edit ] Main article: Robert IV of Sablé Robert de Sablé ( c. 1150 – 7 September 1191) (voiced by Jean-Philippe Dandenaud) is the secondary antagonist of Assassin's Creed . He is a French lieutenant under Richard the Lionheart, and Grand Master of the Knights Templar during the Third Crusade . Born into a powerful family, Robert is immersed into nobility from birth, though events during his life are difficult to pin down; at some point he becomes lord and ruler of Briollay , France. Subsequently, he joins the Knights Templar and eventually becomes their Grand Master in early 1191. During the Third Crusade, Robert and the Templars lay siege to the city of Acre and conquer it; throughout August 1191, they recapture many fortresses and cities along the Palestinian coast, which have been lost previously. Robert follows a goal similar to the Assassins (to end the war in the Holy Land ). Al Mualim has no objections against him ending the Crusade, but opposes the Templar's methods—the Assassins would have people find peace themselves, but the Templars would force their "peace" onto others and attempt to control them. Robert is ultimately assassinated by Altaïr during the Battle of Arsuf in September 1191; which contradicts his historical death in 1193. Tamir [ edit ] Tamir ( c. 1147 – 1191) (voiced by Ammar Daraiseh) is a black arms merchant from Damascus and a member of the Templar Order, who uses his wealth to fund his fellow Templars' operations with the goal of establishing a new world order. He is the first of the nine Levantine Templars to be assassinated by Altaïr. Garnier de Naplouse [ edit ] Main article: Garnier de Nablus Portrait of Garnier de Nablus Garnier de Naplouse ( c. 1147 – 1191) (voiced by Hubert Fielden) is a French nobleman and the tenth Grand Master of the Knights Hospitalier in Acre , as well as a member of the Templar Order. He experiments on and tortures innocent people and lunatics he picks up off the streets of Acre, claiming they are his children and that he is helping them. He transformed Acre Fortress into a hospital and is killed by Altaïr inside it. Talal [ edit ] Talal ( c. 1157 – 1191) (voiced by Jake Eberle) is the leader of a gang of slavers in Jerusalem and a member of the Templar Order. He is Altaïr's third target, and before dying by his blade, he tells the Assassin that he did not sell people for profit, but to "rescue" them by giving them better living conditions. Abu'l Nuqoud [ edit ] Abu'l Nuqoud ( c. 1137 – 1191) (voiced by Fred Tatasciore ) is Damascus' Saracen merchant king and a member of the Templar Order. He invites many Damascan citizens to a grand party at his palace, where all the attendants are killed with poisoned wine or by the guards so that Abu'l Nuqoud may steal their money intended to fund the Saracen army, as well as exact revenge on those who tormented him because of his appearance. He is Altaïr's fourth target, who kills him after infiltrating his party. William of Montferrat [ edit ] Main article: William V, Marquis of Montferrat William V, Marquess of Montferrat (1136–1191) (voiced by Harry Standjofski ), also known as Guglielmo V del Monferrato in Italy , is an Italian Crusader and Richard the Lionheart's regent in Acre, as well as a member of the Templar Order. He plans to kill Richard and give Acre to his son Conrad of Montferrat , and makes his plans inside Acre's Citadel, where he is ultimately assassinated by Altaïr. Majd Addin [ edit ] Majd Addin (died 1191) (voiced by Richard Cansino ), loosely based on Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad , is the Saracen regent of Jerusalem and a member of the Templar Order, who rules the city through fear by making examples out of criminals, whom he executes publicly. He is assassinated by Altaïr during one of his executions. Jubair al Hakim [ edit ] Main article: Ibn Jubayr Jubair al Hakim (died 1191) (voiced by Fred Tatasciore ), loosely based on Ibn Jubayr , is a chief scholar of the Saracens in Damascus and the leader of "The Illuminated", as well as a member of the Templar Order. He plans to have all texts in Damascus burned, claiming that these texts lead people astray. He is killed by Altaïr during one of his public purges. Sibrand [ edit ] Main article: Master Sibrand Sibrand ( c. 1157 – 1191) (voiced by Arthur Holden ) is a German Crusader and the first Grand Master of the Teutonic Order in Acre, as well as a member of the Templar Order. He intends to have all ships submitted to him be used in a blockade against King Richard, but is killed on his personal ship by Altaïr. Characters of Assassin's Creed II and Lineage [ edit ] Ezio Auditore da Firenze [ edit ] Ezio Auditore da Firenze (24 June 1459 – 30 November 1524) (voiced by Roger Craig Smith ; played by Devon Bostick in Assassin's Creed: Lineage ) is the protagonist of Assassin's Creed II , Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood , and Assassin's Creed: Revelations , as well as the spin-off game Assassin's Creed II: Discovery and the animated short film Assassin's Creed: Embers . He is an Italian nobleman born in Florence during the Renaissance and unknown to most historians and philosophers. He becomes an Assassin in 1476 to avenge the death of his father and brothers in a conspiracy masterminded by the Templars, but slowly learns to overcome his desire for revenge and fight for peace and freedom instead. He is essential in elimating the Templar Order's presence in Italy in the early 16th century, and also foils major Templar schemes in both Spain and the Ottoman Empire during his travels. In 1503, Ezio becomes Mentor of the Italian Brotherhood, a title he holds until 1513. Following his retirement from the Brotherhood, he lives a peaceful life with his family in the Tuscan countryside, ultimately passing away from a heart attack in 1524. Ezio is an ancestor to Desmond Miles through the paternal line. Federico Auditore [ edit ] Federico Auditore (1456 – 29 December 1476) (voiced by Elias Toufexis ; [ 58 ] [ 59 ] played by Jesse Rath in Assassin's Creed: Lineage [ 60 ] ) is the eldest child of the Auditore family and Ezio's older brother. [ 61 ] In 1475 he enters the Medici bank as a clerk , but in 1476 is removed from the bank's payroll (on suspicion of being responsible for the disappearance of a bag of florins on 17 September 1475). [ 62 ] At the start of Assassin's Creed II , he helps Ezio fight Vieri de Pazzi, visits a doctor to treat his brother's wound, and races him to the top of Santa Trinita . [ 63 ] He is later captured and hanged alongside his father Giovanni and younger brother Petruccio in the Piazza della Signoria on the orders of Uberto Alberti and Rodrigo Borgia . [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Giovanni Auditore [ edit ] Giovanni Auditore (3 May 1436 – 29 December 1476) (voiced and played by Romano Orzari ), loosely based on Giovanni Villani , [ 67 ] is the head of the Auditore family, Ezio's father, [ 68 ] and a banker , advisor , and nobleman who is a pivotal figure in Florentine banking. Giovanni oversees the Medici bank branches across Italy, and when Lorenzo was busy, he ran the bank. He extends his reach into the bank's international operations, and notices the problems with the Lyon bank, which Francesco Sassetti saves. In 1471 he secures the negotiations between the Pope and the Medici bank. [ 69 ] Giovanni is also secretly a member of the Italian Brotherhood of Assassins, and, in 1476, uncovers a plot by Rodrigo Borgia and the Pazzi family to overthrow the Medici. Before he can expose it, however, he and two of his sons, Federico and Petruccio, are arrested and subsequently hanged on the orders of Borgia and Giovanni's former ally, Uberto Alberti. Before his death, Giovanni directs Ezio to find his Assassin equipment, thus setting his son on the path of becoming an Assassin. Claudia Auditore [ edit ] Claudia Auditore (2 January 1461 – unknown) (voiced by Angela Galuppo ) [ 70 ] is the only daughter of the Auditore family and Ezio's younger sister. Following her father and brothers' execution in 1476, she flees Florence with her mother and Ezio. In 1477, Claudia becomes the financial accountant of the town of Monteriggioni , which is under the leadership of her uncle, Mario Auditore. The town flourishes with Claudia's organization and the money made from Monteriggioni's shops and organizations. In January 1500, Monteriggioni is besieged and largely destroyed by the Papal army commanded by Cesare Borgia , which leave the Auditores homeless. Going against Ezio's desire for them to return to Florence, Claudia and Maria follow Ezio to Rome, where the former eventually becomes the madame of the Rosa in Fiore, the city's most popular brothel. After proving herself to be a worthy fighter to her brother, Ezio inducts Claudia into the Assassin Brotherhood in 1502. The following year, Claudia is captured by Borgia die-hards, and is subsequently saved by Ezio and Niccolò Machiavelli . During this time, she steps down as the madame, and stays in Florence with her friend Paola to recover until 1507. Claudia is given temporary control of the Italian Assassins in 1510 when her brother leaves on a journey to the Middle East to find Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad 's library. She holds the position until her brother returns in late 1512, after which Ezio resigns from the Brotherhood and assigns a successor. Maria Auditore [ edit ] Maria Auditore (1432–1504) (voiced by Ellen David ; played by Claudia Ferri in Assassin's Creed: Lineage ) is a writer and noble. She was born into the Mozzi, a powerful banking family. She is one of the most famous historical sources of the time period due to her multi-volume diary, which has been translated by several notable scholars and is on display in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence . With funding from her parents, she opened up a bakery in the courtyard of her family palazzo, which she transformed into an artistic gathering place. In 1448, she meets Giovanni Auditore, and marries him in 1450. [ 71 ] Following the death of her husband and two of her sons, Federico and Petruccio, in 1476, she flees Florence with her surviving son Ezio and daughter Claudia, and moves into the estate of her brother-in-law, Mario Auditore, in Monteriggioni . Years later, following the attack on Monteriggioni in early 1500, she moves to Rome with her family, where she helps Claudia manage the Rosa in Fiore brothel until her death in 1504. Petruccio Auditore [ edit ] Petruccio Auditore (1463 – 29 December 1476) is a student and noble, and the youngest child of the Auditore family. In 1475, he is pulled from school due to illness and confined to a bed. A year later, Petruccio, his father Giovanni, and older brother Federico are arrested and then hanged in the Piazza della Signoria on the orders of Rodrigo Borgia and Uberto Alberti. [ 72 ] Annetta [ edit ] Annetta (1457–1511) (voiced by Anne-Marie Baron) is the Auditore family's live-in servant . In 1476, she leaves Florence with Ezio, Claudia, and Maria and moves into the estate of Mario Auditore in Monteriggioni, but later returns to Florence to be with her sister, Paola. She dies under unknown circumstances around 1511. [ 73 ] Cristina Vespucci [ edit ] Cristina Vespucci (1459–1498) (voiced by Amber Goldfarb [ 74 ] ), based on Simonetta Vespucci , is a well-known Florentine beauty, and a favorite of painters; most notably Sandro Botticelli , who uses her as a model for several of his paintings. She is the cousin of the Italian explorer, financier, navigator and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci . Cristina is introduced as Ezio's first love interest in Assassin's Creed II , though most of her story is told during the "Repressed Memory Sequences" from Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood . When Ezio has to leave for Monteriggioni , he asks Cristina to come with him, but she refuses, as she does not want to leave her family behind. Ezio accepts her decision and gives her a pendant to remember him by. In 1478, Cristina marries Manfredo Soderini, more because of her father's will than her own. The day before their wedding, Ezio returns to Florence and visits Cristina, unaware of the direction her life has taken. Cristina tells Ezio she did not expect him to return and reveals her engagement. Even though he is heartbroken, Ezio appeals to Manfredo's conscience, and tells him to stop gambling and be a good husband. Years later, Cristina and her husband travel to Venice for Carnevale . Ezio, who also happens to be in the city, tries to use this opportunity to reconnect with her, only to be rejected, as Cristina tells him that she loved him, but he left her to be married to another man. During the bonfire of the vanities in 1498, Cristina, due to her noble status, is attacked by Girolamo Savonarola 's fanatics. Ezio comes to her aid, but she is mortally wounded. Cristina shows him the pendant he gave her twenty-two years ago, and says she wished for another chance with him before dying in his arms. Mario Auditore [ edit ] Mario Auditore (19 March 1434 – 2 January 1500) (voiced by Fred Tatasciore ) is Giovanni Auditore's older brother and Ezio's uncle. He is a condottiero and nobleman who stays at Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni and patrols the Tuscan countryside, as well as the Mentor of the Italian Assassins from at least 1476 until his death. In 1440, he starts his military career when he plays an important role in the Battle of Anghiari : on an expedition to Monterchi with his father, he alerts Micheletto Attendolo to the surprise advance of Milanese troops. The attack is foiled and the Florentines win the battle. He then defends Monteriggioni's interests by derailing Florentine attempts to seize Tuscan territory. [ 75 ] After Giovanni's death, he brings his children and wife to the Villa and teaches Ezio about the conflict between Assassins and Templars, [ 76 ] eventually inducting him into the Assassin Brotherhood in 1488. Mario is later killed by Cesare Borgia during his attack on Monteriggioni in early 1500. Leonardo da Vinci [ edit ] Portrait of Leonardo da Vinci by Francesco Melzi Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) (voiced by Carlos Ferro ) was an Italian Renaissance polymath and ally of the Assassin Brotherhood. His lifelong friendship with Ezio begins when Maria has Ezio help Leonardo move some paintings from his new workshop. Leonardo comments that his current work lacks purpose, but Maria is confident that he will go on to do great things. After Ezio's father and brothers are executed, Ezio brings two objects from his father's study to Leonardo: a broken hidden blade and a Codex page written by Altaïr . Leonardo repairs the blade and deciphers the Codex, fascinated by the technological secrets it alludes to. As Ezio continues his Assassin training, Leonardo makes several upgrades to Ezio's weapons and armor, including a poison blade, gun, and poison dart launcher. Some time after Ezio foils the Pazzi conspiracy , Leonardo receives a commission from a Venetian noble, prompting him to set up a new workshop in Venice . As Ezio had his own business in the city, he accompanies him. Leonardo develops an interest in flight, and invents an experimental flying machine , which Ezio uses on one of his missions. After seeing the Apple of Eden, Leonardo marvels at the futuristic visions it shows him. He then develops an interest in Pythagoras 's findings, and is able to create a map leading to a temple built by his followers. Leonardo is blackmailed by Cesare Borgia into designing Templar war machines, but secretly continues to support Ezio until he is kidnapped by a third party, the Cult of Hermes, who want him to lead them to the Temple of Pythagoras. He is rescued by Ezio and explores the temple, fascinated by the numeric codes found within. Although Leonardo does not appear in Assassin's Creed: Revelations , its novelization describes him dying peacefully at his home in Amboise , with his friends, including Ezio, at his side. In Assassin's Creed III , the Davenport Homestead's residential carpenter obtains some of Leonardo's blueprints and, at Connor 's request, builds a prototype replica of the original flying machine. Lorenzo de' Medici [ edit ] Portrait of Lorenzo de' Medici by Peter Paul Rubens (17th century) Lorenzo de' Medici (1 January 1449 – 9 April 1492) (voiced and played by Alex Ivanovici ) was an Italian statesman and de facto ruler of the Florentine Republic during the Italian Renaissance . Known as "il Magnifico" (the Magnificent) by contemporary Florentines, he was a diplomat, politician and patron of scholars, artists, and poets. His life coincided with the high point of the early Italian Renaissance. His death in 1492 marked the end of the Golden Age of Florence, as the end of his life also meant the end of the fragile peace he had helped maintain between the various Italian states. In Assassin's Creed: Lineage and Assassin's Creed II , Lorenzo is portrayed as an ally of the Assassins, particularly the House of Auditore, working closely with Giovanni against the corrupt Rodrigo Borgia . After Giovanni's death, Lorenzo is saved by Ezio during the Pazzi conspiracy , which starts a long-term partnership between them, with Ezio carrying out several assassination contracts for him. Caterina Sforza [ edit ] La dama dei gelsomini , by Lorenzo di Credi , presumed portrait of Caterina Sforza Caterina Sforza (1463 – 28 May 1509) (voiced by Cristina Rosato ) was the Countess of Forlì and Imola, and the daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza , the Duke of Milan . She was engaged to Pope Sixtus IV 's nephew, Girolamo Riario , at only 10 years of age, and consummated the marriage at 14. As the countess of Forlì, she becomes a strong ally of the Assassin Brotherhood, meeting Ezio after her husband Girolamo traps her on a small island in Romagna. Eight years later, Caterina has the Orsi brothers kill her husband after finding out that he was working for the Templars and for being a poor husband. Caterina offers to keep the Apple of Eden safe in Forlì, but she, Ezio, and Niccolò Machiavelli find the city taken by the Orsi brothers, who were hired by the Templars. Retaking the city, Ezio saves Caterina's children from the Orsi and kills them, though the Apple is stolen from him by a mysterious monk. In 1500, Caterina travels to the Italian Assassins' headquarters in Monteriggioni , requesting help against Cesare Borgia 's army. Monteriggioni is besieged by Cesare the next day, causing the town to be destroyed and Caterina to be captured. The next year, Caterina is transported to the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome to be jailed. Ezio infiltrates the Castel and frees Caterina with a key taken from Lucrezia Borgia . A few weeks later, Caterina returns to Florence to await the restoration of her lands. However, her request to Pope Julius II is rejected, and Caterina ultimately dies in Florence from pneumonia in 1509. Niccolò Machiavelli [ edit ] Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli (3 May 1469 – 21 June 1527) (voiced by Shawn Baichoo ), or simply Niccolò Machiavelli , is a supporting character in Assassin's Creed II , Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood , and related media. He is an Italian philosopher, writer, and a member of the Italian Brotherhood of Assassins. Within the Brotherhood, he primarily works with Ezio, and helps him with driving the Orsi brothers from Forlì and removing the friar Girolamo Savonarola from power in Florence to obtain the Apple of Eden from him. Following Mario Auditore's death in early 1500, Machiavelli becomes the de facto leader of the Italian Assassins, and names Ezio his successor in 1503. Together with Ezio and the other Assassin, he fights against the corrupt Borgia family and their Templar allies, ultimately succeeding in removing them from power. Paola [ edit ] Paola (1438 – unknown) (voiced by Claudia Ferri ) is the madame of La Rosa Colta, the most popular brothel in Florence, and a member of the Italian Brotherhood of Assassins. In 1446, she was orphaned when her parents were killed at sea, so she began her life of prostitution on the streets until 1454. In 1458 she is arrested for murdering a city guard , and Giovanni Auditore represents her in court, winning the case on a self-defence plea . She is released from prison and starts her own brothel to protect other unfortunate women of the street. [ 77 ] Following Giovanni's death in 1476, she guides Ezio in his path to become an Assassin, teaching him how to pickpocket and use crowds of people to hide from city guards. She is later present for Ezio's initiation into the Brotherhood in 1488, and the attack on the Vatican in 1499, creating a distraction alongside other Assassins to allow Ezio to confront Rodrigo Borgia . It is unknown when she died, though in 1512 Ezio's sister Claudia, with whom she had become close friends, mentioned that Paola was still alive and leading the Assassins. La Volpe [ edit ] Gilberto (voiced by Vito DeFilippo), known mainly as La Volpe (English: The Fox ), is the leader of the Florentine and Roman Thieves' Guilds, and a member of the Italian Brotherhood of Assassins. Very little is known about his life outside of what is depicted in the games. In 1478, La Volpe assists Ezio in locating an important Templar meeting in Florence, which results in Ezio preventing the Pazzi conspiracy . Ten years later, La Volpe is present for Ezio's induction into the Brotherhood. In 1499, he helps his fellow Assassins attack the Vatican as a distraction to allow Ezio to confront Rodrigo Borgia . After the fall of Monteriggioni in early 1500, La Volpe moves to Rome, where fights the Borgia influence in the city. However, he refuses to work with the Assassins because of his suspicions towards Niccolò Machiavelli . After Ezio helps save some of his thieves and uncovers the identity of the real traitor, La Volpe agrees to assist the Assassins again. Antonio de Magianis [ edit ] Antonio de Magianis (1443 – unknown) (voiced by Carlo Mestroni) is the leader of the Gilda dei Ladri di Venezia (the Venetian Thieves' Guild) and a member of the Italian Brotherhood of Assassins. He was born at the very bottom of Venetian society, son of a cobbler , while his mother was a live-in maid for the Bellini family. He taught himself to read and write between the apprenticeship sessions with his father, then applied to the University of Padua . He was denied entry due to his low social rank, and was also rejected by other schools in Italy. In 1469, he robbed a noble Venetian estate owned by the rector of the University of Padua, and was later incarcerated, but mysteriously escaped from prison. [ 78 ] Antonio serves as one of Ezio's most prominent allies during his time in Venice, and is later present for his initiation into the Brotherhood in 1488, as well as the attack on the Vatican in 1499, where he creates a distraction alongside other Assassins to allow Ezio to confront Rodrigo Borgia . Rosa [ edit ] Rosa (1460 – unknown) (voiced by Lita Tresierra ) is a member of the Venetian Thieves' Gild and an ally of the Assassins. As the daughter of an unknown Venetian nobleman and a prostitute, she grew up on her own on the streets of Venice. In 1475, she met Antonio de Magianis while attempting to pickpocket him; Antonio caught her, but was impressed by her skills and took her on as a pupil. [ 79 ] Rosa becomes a close friend and love interest of Ezio during his time in Venice, and later replaces Claudia as the madame of the Rosa in Fiore in Rome, after the latter abandons the position in 1504. Teodora Contanto [ edit ] Teodora Contanto (1450 – unknown) (voiced by Nadia Verrucci) is the madame of La Rosa della Virtù, the most popular brothel in Venice, and a member of the Italian Brotherhood of Assassins. Her parents owned a jewellery store , and she was apprenticed to her mother as a shop girl. On 26 November 1467, she engaged in adultery with a married man, and his wife alerted the Venetian courts, so her parents sent her to a nunnery to live the rest of her life in prayer and silence.

With Ezio's help, Yusuf establishes good relations with the Ottoman monarchy by befriending Suleiman I and thwarting the Templars' attempts to rebuild the Byzantine Empire . When Ezio has to leave for Cappadocia , he entrusts Yusuf to look after Sofia Sartor in his absence. Sofia's shop is later raided by the Templars, and although Yusuf and the other Assassins try fighting them off, they are ultimately overwhelmed and killed. Ezio discovers Yusuf's body upon his return to Constantinople and uses his death to rally the remaining Assassins to fight the Templars.

In the game, a seventeen-year-old Suleiman befriends Ezio shortly after the latter's arrival in Constantinople, and initially avoids telling him of his true identity by posing as a simple student. However, after Ezio saves Suleiman from a kidnapping attempt by the Templars, the latter enlists his help in investigating the feud between his father, Selim I , and uncle, Ahmet , over the claim to the Ottoman throne. This leads Ezio to uncover a Templar plot, headed by Ahmet (whom Suleiman had always supported over Selim), to restore the Byzantine Empire and use Isu artifacts to establish what the Templars view as "peace" by eradicating all differences between men. After discovering his uncle's betrayal, Suleiman, although shocked and not agreeing with the Templars' views, asks Ezio to spare Ahmet's life if he can. Suleiman also speaks with his father and, while unsuccessful in persuading him not to kill Ahmet, manages to convince him to spare Ezio and exile him from Constantinople instead.

Suleiman decides to act on his theory and asks Ezio to kill Tarik. In his final moments, Tarik reveals that he feigned his betrayal to get close to the Templars and discover their hideout in Cappadocia , which he planned to attack. He makes a final request to Ezio to stop the Templars, which the latter honors. Tarik is one of the few assassination targets in the series that is unaffiliated with the Templars or Assassins. Dilara [ edit ] Dilara (voiced by Nadia Verrucci) is an Ottoman spy sent by Tarik Barleti to infiltrate the Byzantine Templars' hideout in Cappadocia , to observe their movements and make preparations for when Tarik and his men would attack them. However, the attack does not occur, due to Ezio killing Tarik, and the spies accompanying Dilara are eventually discovered and captured. When Ezio arrives in Cappadocia in 1512, he attempts to make amends for his assassination of Tarik by carrying out his original plan and meets with Dilara.

His rule was marked by the enormous expansion of the Empire, in particular the conquest of the Levant , Hejaz , Tihamah , and Egypt , which became known together as the Mamluk Sultanate . He was succeeded by his only living son, Suleiman . Although most of Assassin's Creed: Revelations takes place during Selim's fight with his brother Ahmet over the claim to the Ottoman throne, Selim himself has only a few references throughout the main story and appears briefly at the end, when he confronts Ahmet and Ezio shortly after forcing Bayezid to abdicate. Proclaiming his new authority as Sultan, Selim murders Ahmet, but spares Ezio due to Suleiman's endorsement, instead ordering him to leave Constantinople and never return. Ahmet [ edit ] Main article: Şehzade Ahmet Ahmet ( c. 1465 – 25 April 1512) (voiced by Tamer Hassan ) is the main antagonist of Assassin's Creed: Revelations . He is an Ottoman Şehzade (prince), the eldest living son of Bayezid II , the older brother of Selim I , and Suleiman 's uncle. Between him and Selim, Bayezid favored Ahmet as an heir due to his calm and calculated demeanor. This enraged Selim, who wanted the Ottoman throne for himself and began fighting his brother in 1509. Around the same time, Ahmet secretly joined the Templar Order, who promised him the power to end all feuds that divided men, and eventually became the Grand Master of the Byzantine Rite. Although Ahmet himself was Ottoman, he nonetheless helped the Templars infiltrate Constantinople to further their plans of re-establishing the Byzantine Empire . He also started an expedition to find the keys to Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad 's library, believing it contained the location of the Isu's Grand Temple and would thus further the Templar cause. In 1511, Ahmet sets up an unsuccessful ambush to capture Suleiman, intending to have him rescued and appear as a brave hero. The plan is foiled by Ezio, who then investigates the Byzantine Templars at Suleiman's request, leading him to uncover Ahmet's betrayal. After learning Ezio has found all the library keys, Ahmet has his love interest, Sofia Sartor, kidnapped, to ransom her for the keys. After obtaining the keys, Ahmet tries to flee Constantinople, but is defeated by Ezio, just as Selim's army arrives. Proclaiming his authority as the new Sultan, Selim then executes Ahmet by strangling him and tossing him off a cliff.

After an Ottoman ambush on his tribe left him orphaned and alone, Shahkulu, seeking revenge and a sense of belonging, joined the Byzantine Rite of the Templar Order. By 1511, he had become well known for his ruthlessness, especially towards Ottomans, and was in a partnership with Manuel Palaiologos , believing that if he helped him restore the Byzantine Empire , he would be generously rewarded. Although Shahkulu historically died in battle in July 1511, in the game he is shown surviving until 1512, when he is found in Cappadocia , violently beating Ottoman spies to death in a chapel. After surviving Ezio's initial assassination attempt, he is slain in the ensuing fight.

Abbas, who had grown up believing his father had left the Brotherhood, branded Altaïr a liar, and developed a lifelong hatred for him. After Altaïr kills their Mentor, Al Mualim , in 1191, Abbas stands against Altaïr, who wants to become the Brotherhood's new leader.

With Sef and Malik out of the way, Abbas holds the most power over the Brotherhood, and he implements a council with himself as its head. Eventually, he disbands the council, usurping the title of Mentor, and becomes the sole leader of the Levantine Assassins. Under Abbas' leadership, the Order declines and becomes corrupt. Additionally, Abbas spends most of his time hiding in Masyaf's fortress, fearing for his life. After Altaïr returns from his exile, the Assassins, disillusioned with Abbas' rule, join him again and help him get to Abbas, who is killed by Altaïr's newest invention: the Hidden Gun.

After Maria is also killed, Darim and Altaïr are forced to flee Masyaf. The two later have a falling out due to Altaïr's depression and obsession with the Apple of Eden, and Darim leaves him to support Sef's widow and children. In 1247, Altaïr returns alone and kills Abbas, reclaiming the title of Mentor. Darim returns soon after and stays in Masyaf until it is attacked by the Mongols in 1257. After repelling the attack, Altaïr, knowing the Mongols will return, decides to seal himself in the library he had built. Before that, he bids farewell to Darim, telling him to go and live his life.

After the Revolutionary War, he focuses on rebuilding the Colonial Brotherhood of Assassins, which had been all but eradicated by the Templars decades prior, and becomes its Mentor.

During this time, Haytham sires a son, Ratonhnaké:ton / Connor , with a Native American woman, who in turn joins the Assassins and undoes most of his father's work. Though Haytham and Connor briefly become allies and consider unifying their orders, they both ultimately realise that peace between the Assassins and Templars is impossible, and their conflict culminates with Haytham's death at Connor's hands in 1781. [ 122 ] Achilles Davenport [ edit ] Achilles Davenport ( c. 1710 – September 1781) (voiced by Roger Aaron Brown ) is a major supporting character in Assassin's Creed III , and the main antagonist of Assassin's Creed Rogue . He is a Master Assassin who serves as Mentor of the Colonial Brotherhood from 1746 until his retirement in 1763. Trained by Ah Tabai, the Mentor of the West Indies Brotherhood, Achilles travels to the American Colonies in 1740 to establish his own branch of the Brotherhood, which he develops over the following years by recruiting additional members. By 1752, due to the lack of a strong Templar presence in North America at the time, Achilles and his Brotherhood have started to focus on finding Pieces of Eden before the Templars can. Around the same time, Achilles' wife Abigail and son Connor die of typhoid fever , greatly affecting the Mentor, who becomes more distant and reckless with his actions as a result. In 1755, after his apprentice's, Shay Cormac , attempt to retrieve a Piece of Eden results in Lisbon's destruction , Achilles refuses to listen to Shay's pleas to stop the search for the Pieces, resulting in the latter betraying the Brotherhood and eventually joining the Templar Order. With Shay's help, the Templars purge the Colonial Brotherhood over the following years, though Achilles himself is spared by the Templar Grand Master, Haytham Kenway , at Shay's request, so that he could warn the other Assassins of the Pieces' destructive capabilities after witnessing them first hand. After being crippled by Haytham, Achilles retires to his homestead, becoming a hermit, until he meets Ratonhnhaké:ton in 1769, who is eager to become an Assassin. Though reluctant at first, he trains Ratonhnhaké:ton in the Assassins' ways, and renames him Connor, after his own late son, to help him blend in with colonial society. Achilles and Connor frequently argue during the latter's quest to eliminate the Colonial Templars, as Connor hopes to make peace with them since they share a common goal. Despite this, the two develop a genuine father-son bond, and Connor even helps Achilles find new purpose in life by bringing in new people to his homestead, turning it into a small community. Achilles eventually passes away of old age in 1781, and his death is mourned by Connor and all the homesteaders. Kaniehtí꞉io [ edit ] Kaniehtí꞉io (1731 – 2 November 1760) (voiced by Kaniehtiio Horn ), also known as Ziio , is a Kanien'keha:ka ( Mohawk ) clan woman and warrior, and the mother of Ratonhnhaké꞉ton / Connor. Unlike her fellow villagers, who prefer to stay neutral to protect their sacred sanctuary, she fights settlers encroaching on her people's lands. In 1754, she becomes allies with Haytham Kenway , who seeks access to the sanctuary. The two share a brief relationship, which results in Connor's birth. However, Ziio is left to raise their son alone, as Haytham abandons her after she accuses him of simply using her to achieve his goal. When her son is four, Ziio dies in an attack on their village ordered by George Washington ; Connor grows up believing Haytham's subordinate Charles Lee is responsible, which sets him on the path to join the Assassins. Kanenʼtó꞉kon [ edit ] Kanenʼtó꞉kon (1756 – 17 June 1778) (voiced by Akwiratékha Martin) is a member of the Kanien'kehá:ka nation in the Mohawk Valley and a close childhood friend of Connor. Although he initially advocates for the Kanien'kehá:ka to remain neutral in the American Revolutionary War , he and several other of his village's warriors believe that they can protect their people by siding with the British. He is manipulated by Charles Lee into believing that Connor had joined George Washington in a campaign against the Mohawk people, prompting him to attack his former friend when he tries to intervene in a Mohawk ambush on colonial soldiers. Pinned to the ground and vulnerable to a lethal blow, Connor is forced to stab Kanenʼtó꞉kon in the neck with his Hidden Blade, killing him. Oiá꞉ner [ edit ] Oiá꞉ner is the Clan Mother of the Kanien'kehá:ka village of Kanatahséton. [ 123 ] She and the other Kanien'kehá:ka in the village serve as protectors of the sacred ground on which both their village and the Grand Temple stood. Oiá꞉ner is also the keeper of the tribe's "Crystal Ball", a Piece of Eden which allows anyone to communicate with the Isu Juno . In 1769, Oiá꞉ner shows the Crystal Ball to Connor when he returns from a hunt and allows him to interact with it. Through the Crystal Ball, Juno informs Connor of his destiny as an Assassin and urges him to leave the village and seek out Achilles Davenport. Many years later, Oiá꞉ner meets an adult Connor and tells him of the whereabouts of Kanenʼtó꞉kon and other Kanien'kehá:ka men, who are attempting to attack Continental soldiers. Sometime after Kanenʼtó꞉kon's death, Oiá꞉ner speaks with Connor, and reveals that she plans to move their people west, far from the American Revolutionary War , like many of the other nations. After his unpleasant reaction, she tells him that she would do what was best for her people, and Connor leaves the village. On his return some years later, he finds the village deserted except for an old hunter, who tells him that his people have already left. Robert Faulkner [ edit ] Robert Faulkner (1715 – unknown) (voiced by Kevin McNally ) is an elderly sailor and Assassin who serves as Connor's first mate aboard the Aquila . He has a reputation for having a disciplined crew, avoiding trouble, and predicting the weather accurately. Although he is the fourth generation in his family to become a sailor, he is the first to be recruited into the Assassin Brotherhood. Faulkner started off in the Royal Navy , but after finding that his career is stalling (partly due to his inability to purchase commissions), he went to work for the United Company of Merchants. In 1753, Faulkner disappears from the historical record, presumed dead—because it was around this time that he joined the Assassins as first mate of the Aquila . When the Aquila is nearly destroyed in 1768, Faulkner retires to a shack near Achilles Davenport's homestead, trying to drink his sorrows away. [ 124 ] He finds new purpose in life when he meets Connor a few years later, who repairs the Aquila and becomes its captain. George Washington [ edit ] Main article: George Washington Portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart George Washington (22 February 1732 – 14 December 1799) (voiced by Robin Atkin Downes in Assassin's Creed III and by Tod Fennell in Assassin's Creed Rogue ) was the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War from 1775 to 1783, and later served as the first President of the United States from 30 April 1789 to 4 March 1797. Prior to the Revolutionary War, Washington also fought in the Seven Years' War and led several attacks against neutral or enemy Native tribes, including the neutral village of Kanatahséton in 1760. During the Revolutionary War, Washington is targeted by the Templars, in particular his own subordinate and political rival Charles Lee , who is angered that he had been passed over for the position of Commander-in-Chief, leading Connor to inform Washington of the existence of both the Assassins and the Templars in order to protect him. Although the Continental Army initially suffers many losses under Washington's command, Connor and his Assassin apprentices help win the army several small victories. Over time, Washington develops a strong working relationship with Connor, thought this falls apart after the latter discovers Washington was behind the Kanatahséton attack, which killed his mother, and now plans a second attack after Lee manipulated Connor's people into siding with the Loyalists. Nevertheless, Connor remains loyal to the Patriot cause, and thanks to his efforts, the Continental Army ultimately emerges victorious in 1783. After the war, Washington seeks Connor's help in disposing of an Apple of Eden he had seized, which has been giving him nightmares of an alternate timeline where Washington ruled over the United States as a tyrant. Thanks to these visions, as well as Connor's words of advice, Washington would become inspired to be a just leader for the American people when he was later elected President. Samuel Adams [ edit ] Main article: Samuel Adams Portrait of Samuel Adams by John Singleton Copley Samuel Adams (27 September 1722 – 2 October 1803) (voiced by Mark Lindsay Chapman ) was an American statesman, political philosopher, a Sons of Liberty Patriot and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States . During the American Revolution , Adams meets and becomes a trusted associate of Connor, after Achilles Davenport tells him to find Adams on his first trip to Boston . Connor would subsequently aid Adams and the Sons of Liberty several times throughout the Revolution, most notably during the Boston Tea Party in 1773. Benjamin Franklin [ edit ] Main article: Benjamin Franklin Portrait of Benjamin Franklin by Joseph Duplessis , 1778 Benjamin Franklin (17 January 1706 – 17 April 1790) (voiced by Jim Ward in Assassin's Creed III and by Rick Jones in Assassin's Creed Rogue ) was a freemason , a noted polymath , and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States . Franklin is first encountered by Haytham Kenway in Boston in 1754, when he requests the latter's help in finding the stolen pages of his Poor Richard's Almanack . Around the same time, Franklin was being unknowingly used by the Templars to study the Precursor box they had seized, which was given to him by William Johnson . However, the Assassins Shay Cormac and Hope Jensen are able to hijack the research by posing as associates of Johnson's. They help Franklin with his experiments on the box, generating a map which shows the locations of various Precursor sites. By 1756, the Assassins have commissioned Franklin to develop various weapons for them, including a prototype grenade launcher , though this would later be given to Shay, who visits Franklin at his lab in New York after his defection to the Templars. During the American Revolutionary War , Franklin is appointed the first United States Ambassador to France and moves to Paris , where he unexpectedly encounters Shay again in 1776. After Shay saves him from a gang of street criminals, Franklin helps him infiltrate the Palace of Versailles for a supposed "business meeting" (in reality, Shay came to retrieve the Precursor box from the Assassins, who were having a secret meeting there). Despite his many interactions with various Assassins and Templars throughout his life, Franklin doesn't appear to be aware of the existence of either of the two orders. Paul Revere [ edit ] Main article: Paul Revere Portrait of Paul Revere by John Singleton Copley , c. 1768–1770 Paul Revere (1 January 1735 – 10 May 1818) (voiced by Bruce Dinsmore ) was an American silversmith , engraver , early industrialist, and a Son of Liberty Patriot. He is best remembered for his 1775 midnight ride to alert the colonial militia to the approach of British forces before the Battles of Lexington and Concord , which marked the start of the American Revolutionary War . In the game, he is accompanied by Connor during this ride, after being previously introduced to the Assassin by Samuel Adams . Thanks to Revere and Connor's efforts, the Patriots are able to organize a defense in time and ultimately win the two battles. Israel Putnam [ edit ] Main article: Israel Putnam Major General Israel Putnam Israel Putnam (7 January 1718 – 29 May 1790) (voiced by Andreas Apergis) was an American military officer and Patriot commander during the American Revolutionary War . He is best remembered for fighting with distinction at the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775 at the start of the war. In the game, he is shown being assisted by Connor during the battle, whom Putnam initially distrusts, but later comes to respect after the Assassin proves himself by killing the British commander and Templar John Pitcairn . Although both sides suffer heavy casualties, Pitcairn ultimately deems the battle a lost cause and orders his troops to retreat, allowing the British to capture Charlestown . The following year, after Connor thwarts an assassination attempt on George Washington that he was originally framed for, Putnam comes to his defense and praises him, calling Connor a hero. Benjamin Tallmadge [ edit ] Main article: Benjamin Tallmadge Benjamin Tallmadge (25 February 1754 – 7 March 1831) was an officer of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War , as well as a spymaster who organized the Culper Ring spy circle alongside George Washington during the British occupation of New York . He would later become a politician after the war, being elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1801. In the game, he is also a close friend of Achilles Davenport, as Tallmadge's father was an Assassin, although Tallmadge opted not to follow in his footsteps and join the Brotherhood due to hoping to lead a normal life someday and not enjoying the idea of "living in two worlds." In 1776, after learning Connor had uncovered a plot to kill Washington, Tallmadge enlists his help in stopping the assassin, the Templar Thomas Hickey , although both Connor and Hickey would end up arrested by the Patriots and jailed after an altercation in New York. Tallmadge tries to use his position in the government to secure Connor's release and ensure Hickey remains imprisoned by accusing him of the assassination plot, but his efforts are thwarted by the Templars, who manage to get Hickey pardoned and frame Connor for the plot. Nevertheless, Connor would ultimately escape his execution and kill Hickey before he could carry out Washington's assassination. Mason Weems [ edit ] Main article: Mason Weems Mason Locke Weems (11 October 1759 – 23 April 1825) (voiced by Tod Fennell ) was an American minister, evangelical bookseller, and author best known for writing the first biography of George Washington immediately after his death. Weems held Washington in very high esteem and much of his work praised Washington and highlighted his feats, although many of them were greatly exaggerated. In the game, Weems is encountered by Connor in Bridewell Prison in 1776, where he tries to help the latter escape after learning that Washington's life is in danger and that Connor is trying to save him. Marquis de Lafayette [ edit ] Main article: Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette Portrait of Lafayette as a Lieutenant General in 1791, by Joseph-Désiré Court Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette (6 September 1757 – 20 May 1834) (voiced by Vince Corazza ), commonly known as Lafayette , was a French aristocrat, freemason and military officer who fought in the American Revolutionary War , commanding Patriot troops in several battles. He would later serve as a key figure in both the French Revolution of 1789 and the July Revolution of 1830, and is considered a national hero in both France and the United States. In the game, Lafayette works alongside Connor several times during the Revolutionary War, most notably during the Battle of Monmouth in 1778, resulting in Lafayette becoming one of Connor's most trusted associates. As such, the Assassin would later enlist Lafayette's help in planning his infiltration of Fort George in 1781 in order to assassinate Charles Lee . Benedict Arnold [ edit ] Main article: Benedict Arnold Portrait of Benedict Arnold by Thomas Hart, 1776 Benedict Arnold (14 January 1741 – 14 June 1801) (voiced by Graham Cuthbertson) was an American-born military officer who served as Major General in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War . Although initially regarded as a war hero, he had a propensity for arguing with his superiors, meaning he would often be passed over for promotions. As such, after being given command of West Point in 1780 by George Washington , Arnold secretly betrayed the Patriots and planned to surrender the fort to the British. In the game, Washington becomes distrustful of Arnold and asks Connor to investigate rumors of his betrayal, which the latter discovers to be true upon intercepting a letter discussing Arnold's plan. He then confronts Arnold but is distracted by the British's attack of West Point, and Arnold is able to escape by boat while Connor helps the Patriot soldiers defend the fort. For the rest of the war, Arnold would serve as a brigadier general in the British Army and lead British troops against his former allies, but his name has since become synonymous with treason and betrayal in the United States. François-Joseph Paul de Grasse [ edit ] Main article: François Joseph Paul de Grasse François-Joseph Paul de Grasse (13 September 1722 – 11 January 1788) was a French Navy admiral best known for his command of the French fleet at the Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781 in the last year of the American Revolutionary War . In the game, Connor aids de Grasse during the battle using the Aquila in exchange for the admiral's help with his infiltration of Fort George in order to assassinate Charles Lee . After the French's victory, de Grasse upholds his end of the deal and has the French fleet open fire on the fort, creating a distraction that allows Connor to infiltrate it undetected. Thomas Jefferson [ edit ] Main article: Thomas Jefferson Official Presidential portrait of Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale , 1800 Thomas Jefferson (13 April 1743 – 4 July 1826) (voiced by John Emmet Tracy ) was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and the principal author of the Declaration of Independence who later served as the third President of the United States from 4 March 1801 to 4 March 1809.

Amanda Bailey [ edit ] Amanda Bailey (1730 – unknown) (voiced by Dawn Ford) is an innkeeper living in Martha's Vineyard and a former love interest of Robert Faulkner. During the American Revolutionary War , she secretly works as a spy for the Continental Army and is reunited with Faulkner when the latter and Connor come to Martha's Vineyard to acquire crew members and cannons for the Aquila . She later helps Connor and Faulkner in their hunt for the Continental Navy captain and Templar Nicholas Biddle , telling them about rumors of Biddle's ship, the USS Randolph , being seen raiding ships along the East Coast . Assassin recruits [ edit ] During the game, Connor encounters several individuals that he recruits to the Assassin Brotherhood after assisting them. These people are subsequently trained as Assassins and can come to Connor's aid or be sent to perform individual missions throughout the Thirteen Colonies . Stephane Chapeau (1743 – unknown) (voiced by Shawn Baichoo ) is a French-Canadian chef residing in Boston . His father was a cook for the French army and died while fighting in the French and Indian War . Stephane took up his profession to honor him and moved to Boston in 1764. Beginning with 1765, he was part of several mobs that violently protested the British's treatment of their colonies, in particular their heavy taxation. In 1773, when tax collectors come to Stephane's house to demand he pay his taxes, the latter angrily refuses and calls them thieves before starting to fight them. After Connor, who happened to be nearby, helps him defeat the tax collectors and their enforcers, Stephane continues with his violent protest, eventually killing a taxman who was working for the Templar William Johnson . Connor later informs Stephane of the existence of the Assassins and Templars and invites him to join the Brotherhood and fight against injustice. Stephane accepts and becomes Connor's first Assassin recruit, assisting him several times throughout the American Revolution , most notably during the Boston Tea Party . Duncan Little (1730 – unknown) (voiced by Julian Casey) is an Irish -born colonist living in Boston. He is also the nephew of Miko, the leader of the British Assassin Brotherhood who was killed by Haytham in 1754. Duncan entered priesthood at a young age and was a missionary for several years, but eventually realized the priest life was not for him and moved to America in 1763, after receiving harsh treatment by his family for abandoning the Catholic Church . Here, he quickly gained a reputation as a skilled mediator and helper of the people. In 1773, Duncan becomes acquainted with Connor and requests his help in eliminating a group of mercenaries threatening the livelihoods of Boston's residents. After killilng the leader of the mercenaries, revealed to be a Templar, Connor tells Duncan the truth about the Assassin-Templar conflict and recruits him into the Brotherhood. Clipper Wilkinson (1756 – unknown) (voiced by Joe Cobden ) is a hunter and marksman residing in New York . Born in Virginia as the youngest of five children, he eventually grew tired of having to compete against his siblings and chose to move away, becoming estranged from his family; even more so when the American Revolutionary War broke out and Wilkinson's family sided with the Loyalists . While in Boston in 1775, Wilkinson notices many young men and boys being forcefully conscripted by the British and reaches out to Connor for help. After eliminating the British recruiters and their leader, who was actually a Templar, Connor informs Wilkinson of the existence of the Assassins and Templars and invites him to join the Brotherhood to continue fighting in the name of freedom. Deborah "Dobby" Carter (1736 – unknown) (voiced by Angela Galuppo ) is courier living in New York. The daughter of a merchant suffering from heavy debt from constantly bankrupting businesses, she was orphaned at a young age and was forced to become an errand-runner to survive on the streets. She posed as a boy, taking the name "Dobby," in the hopes of securing more work opportunities; most of her employers saw through her disguise, but hired her nonetheless because of her skills. Upon reaching adulthood, she dropped this facade, but kept her "Dobby" nickname and continued her courier work. She also developed a reputation for helping the poor, always doing her best to aid the less fortunate, even if it meant fighting merchants to ensure they were not charging exorbitant prices. In 1777, amidst a food shortage in New York, Deborah meets Connor and enlists his help in assisting the people suffering because of the famine, as well as tracking down the perpetrators. After recovering the stolen food and killing the thieves—revealed to be Templars—Connor tells Deborah the truth about the Assassin-Templar conflict and recruits her to the Brotherhood. It is implied that Deborah has romantic feelings for Connor, as she flirts with him several times and offers to be his first partner if he ever decides on settling down and starting a family. Jacob Zenger (1739 – unknown) (voiced by Danny Blanco Hall) is a German -born colonist residing in New York. Born near Mannheim in southeast Germany, Jacob is one of thirteen siblings (although only four of them reached adulthood along with him) and is married with a child. Because of the family's poverty and his poor career prospects in Mannheim, Jacob enlisted in the German army and, when the American Revolutionary War broke out, became one of the Hessians sent to support the British army. After arriving overseas, however, he left the service and moved to New York. At one point, he bought a plot of land and attempted to become a farmer, hoping to one day bring his wife and son to America to live with him, but after a string of crop failures he was forced to move back to the city and take up work as a bodyguard. In 1777, after New York is placed under martial law by the British, Jacob joins a resistance movement to liberate the city and meets Connor, who offers to assist him. Upon killing the officer in charge of the martial law, a Templar, Connor informs Jacob of the existence of the Assassins and Templars and recruits him into the Brotherhood. Jamie Colley (1744 – unknown) (voiced by Marcel Jeannin) is a colonist living in New York. Jamie's father was a dock worker who left the family during Jamie's youth, while his mother cared for slaves on a plantation in the southern colonies, causing Jamie to become estranged from her. As a child, he attended Trinity School for three years, where many professors took notice of his intellect and determined that he "was destined for great things." Despite this, he had trouble finding work for many years and was forced to take several odd jobs until a physician finally recognized his potential and hired him as his assistant. In 1777, while caring for people affected by the Great Fire of New York , Jamie meets Connor and requests his help in preventing the spread of an epidemic. After dealing with several Templars who attempted to kill the people infected by the disease to prevent its spread, Connor tells Jamie the truth about the Assassin-Templar conflict and recruits him into the Brotherhood. Jamie would later admit to Connor that he considers him and the Assassins his true family rather than his parents. Davenport Homestead residents [ edit ] Over the course of the game, Connor can encounter several people suffering from displacement due to the American Revolutionary War and invite them to start new lives at the Davenport Homestead, which over time turns into a small, united community. Godfrey (voiced by Harry Standjofski ) and Terry are two Scottish lumberjacks who lived north of Champlain, New York with their wives, Catherine and Diana (voiced by Ellen Newlands) and their children. They are the first people to be invited to the Davenport Homestead, after a young Connor saves Terry from drowning in a river in 1769, and they set up a sawmill, providing the homestead with lumber. Lance O'Donnell is a carpenter who lived and worked in Boston until being evicted by the Loyalists due to his lack of support for them. He is invited to the Davenport Homestead after Connor saves him from several thugs who tried to rob him on the road and sets up a new workshop, creating wooden items from lumber provided by Godfrey and Terry. Myriam is a huntress who refused to conform to the social norms expected of her and elected to live in the wild instead, causing her to lose touch with her family. After encountering a group of poachers hunting on the lands of the Davenport Homestead, she confronts them and is injured as a result, before being found and rescued by Connor. Once Connor deals with the poachers, Myriam is invited to stay at the homestead and sets up a camp, where she hunts, skins and roasts animals, thus providing the homestead with meat and other animal materials. She later marries Norris. Norris (real name Maurice ) is a miner hailing from Montreal who had trouble finding employment due to people disliking his accent and changed his name because many could not pronounce it correctly. After being saved by Connor from several guards assaulting him in Boston , Norris is invited to move to the Davenport Homestead and work on the mine there, providing the homestead with coal and other minerals. He later develops romantic feelings for Myriam and asks for Connor's help impressing her; the two eventually get married. Warren and his wife Prudence (voiced by Lucinda Davis ) are farmers who are invited to the Davenport Homestead by Connor after he saves them from British soldiers who had assaulted them for not giving up their produce. The two set up a new farm (their previous one having been destroyed by the British) and provide the homestead with vegetables and various animals products. Prudence later gives birth to a boy, whom she and Warren name Hunter . David Walston , commonly known as " Big Dave ," is a blacksmith and former soldier who deserted the British army. After being saved by Connor from his former comrades who were preparing to execute him, he is invited to the Davenport Homestead, where he sets up a workshop and crafts weapons and other metal objects. He is later helped by Connor and the other homesteaders in fending off British soldiers who had come to recapture him. Oliver (voiced by David Francis) and his wife Corrine are innkeepers who used to run an inn in Boston until being evicted. They are invited to stay at the Davenport Homestead after bringing a wagon of ale and befriending several of the homesteaders, who appreciate the alcohol and good company. After Connor builds a tavern called The Mile's End , Oliver and Corrine begin running it, providing the homesteaders with drinks and cooked food in addition to accommodating travelers. Lyle White (voiced by Alex Ivanovici ) is a doctor who used to run a practice in Boston until the Loyalists drove him out of business for treating wounded Patriot soldiers. After being found by Connor and recounting his story to him, he is invited to the Davenport Homestead, which was in need of a doctor. When Lyle later becomes overwhelmed by his work, he recruits Diana as his assistant. Ellen is a seamstress who was trapped in an abusive marriage until Connor saved her from a beating by her husband and invited her and her daughter Maria to move to the Davenport Homestead. After building a tailor workshop, Ellen begins creating various clothing items for the homestead's residents as well as other clients. Ellen is later found by her abusive husband, who wants her and Maria to move back with him, but he is driven away by Connor and the homesteaders. Timothy is a pastor hailing from London who moved to America, eventually making his way to the Davenport Homestead, where several residents convinced Connor to allow him to stay. After building a church, Timothy begins presiding over it, in addition to assisting his fellow homesteaders with various problems (such as reading their mail, as most of the homesteaders are illiterate ). Connor is initially wary of Timothy, but the two grow closer after Achilles Davenport's funeral, and Connor has the option of playing Fanorona with him like he did with Achilles. John de la Tour [ edit ] John de la Tour (died 1745) is a French-Canadian Assassin considered to be the first Assassin active in Colonial America . In 1740, while attempting to establish an intelligence network for the French Brotherhood in Acadia , he met Achilles Davenport, who had come to the colonies to form his own Brotherhood. Although Achilles initially disliked John, believing him to be arrogant and reckless, the two came to respect each other as they worked together over the following years to build up the Colonial Brotherhood. In 1744, John purchased and then freed the slave Angélique-Denise, who went on to become Achilles' wife, Abigail Davenport, and he later sacrificed himself to save Achilles and Abigail during the Siege of Louisbourg in 1745. While never seen on-screen, John is mentioned in both Assassin's Creeed III and Assassin's Creed Rogue , and his robes are available to wear as an alternate outfit for Connor. Reginald Birch [ edit ] Reginald Birch (1705 – 9 October 1757) (voiced by Gideon Emery ) is the Grand Master of the British Rite of the Templar Order and a successful English businessman. Birch meets Haytham, the son of Birch's employer— Edward Kenway —at a young age and takes an interest in the boy's training. He later develops an obsession with the Isu and the Pieces of Eden and, after learning that Edward has conducted research on the Isu's Grand Temple which he wrote down in a journal, sends masked men to steal it and kill Edward. Following Edward's death, Birch becomes Haytham's legal guardian and personally oversees his training as a Templar. However, over time Haytham begins to question Birch's motives as the latter attempts to cover his involvement in Edward's death and the kidnapping of Haytham's half-sister Jennifer.  In 1754, Birch sends Haytham to America to locate the Grand Temple based on notes from Edward's journal, as well as establish a permanent Templar presence on the continent. However, Haytham later finds and rescues Jennifer, who tells him that Birch is to blame for their family's demise. The two then storm Birch's chateau in France with Haytham's friend Jim Holden and kill his guards before Birch himself is killed by Jennifer with a sword that Haytham had embedded into Birch's bedroom door. Jim Holden [ edit ] James "Jim" Holden (died 28 January 1758) is a British soldier who served under Edward Braddock during his campaigns in the Dutch Republic . His brother had also served under Braddock and was executed for desertion, so Holden decided to avenge his death by helping Haytham with his investigation of Tom Smith, a mercenary in Braddock's employ with connections to the murder of Haytham's father Edward Kenway . From there, Holden and Haytham become good friends and Holden would continue to aid Haytham under the guise of being his "gentleman's gentleman." While Holden only makes a small appearance in Assassin's Creed III , his role is expanded in the novel Assassin's Creed: Forsaken , where he helps Haytham rescue his half-sister Jennifer and avenge Edward by killing Reginald Birch. However, during Jennifer's rescue, Holden is captured and sent to a monastery in Egypt where he is castrated . Although Haytham rescues him, Holden later commits suicide, unable to cope with what had happened to him. Miko [ edit ] "Miko" (died 18 April 1754) is the alias of the leader of the British Brotherhood of Assassins alongside Edward Kenway , and the holder of the Grand Temple Key. He is assassinated in 1754 by Haytham at the Royal Opera House on the orders of Reginald Birch, who sought to acquire the key in his possession. In the novel Assassin's Creed: Forsaken , it is revealed that Haytham had previously encountered Miko in 1753, when the latter was protecting an Assassin-allied codebreaker, Lucio Albertine, in Corsica , and that the hidden blades wielded by Haytham previously belonged to Miko, having been stolen by Haytham during their encounter. Samuel Smythe [ edit ] Samuel Smythe is the captain of the Providence , the merchant ship which transports Haytham across the Atlantic Ocean , from London to Boston , in 1754. [ 125 ] He is notorious for his frugal business decisions and for treating his crew members poorly, although he does not punish them, unlike most Royal Navy captains. Louis Mills [ edit ] Louis Mills (died 21 May 1754) is a sailor and member of the British Brotherhood of Assassins. He serves as a crew member aboard the Providence during Haytham's journey across the Atlantic Ocean in 1754 and secretly throws marked barrels of cargo overboard to provide a trail that the Assassin ship, the Aquila , could follow. When the Aquila eventually catches up to and attacks the Providence , Haytham is sent below deck where Mills is waiting for him. After revealing his true affiliations, he is challenged by Haytham to a duel in which Mills is subsequently slain. Charles Lee [ edit ] Main article: Charles Lee (general) Major General Charles Lee Charles Lee (6 February 1731 – 2 October 1782) (voiced by Neil Napier) is the secondary antagonist of Assassin's Creed III . He is a British-born soldier, and later a general of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War , as well as the second-in-command of the Colonial Rite of the Templar Order. Lee is first introduced in the game as a young man eager to prove himself to the Templar cause, who was assigned by Reginald Birch to aid Haytham in his mission to locate the Isu's Grand Temple and build a strong Templar presence in America. Lee helps Haytham locate and recruit several Templars for his expedition, and although their mission to find the Grand Temple is ultimately unsuccessful, Haytham formally inducts Lee into the Order in 1755, for the loyalty and bravery he has shown. In 1760, Lee meets a young Connor for the first time while leading another expedition in search for the Grand Temple, and threatens to harm his people if they do not help the Templars. When Connor's village is later destroyed on the orders of George Washington , Connor mistakenly assumes Lee was behind the attack and vows revenge on him and the Templars. Years later, during the Revolutionary War, Lee and his fellow Templars aim to take control of the Revolution by assassinating Washington, who was appointed Commander-in-Chief instead of Lee. It is during this plot that Lee encounters Connor again, now an adult, and recognizes him, before attempting to frame him for the assassination plot so that he would be executed; however, Connor is able to escape his execution and save Washington's life. Once Connor has killed all the Colonial Templars except Haytham and Lee, the latter attempts to hide in Fort George but is convinced by Haytham at the last minute to flee while Haytham stays behind to confront Connor, his son, and is killed as a result. Succeeding Haytham as Grand Master, Lee vows to destroy Connor and everything he holds dear, but is injured by him after a pursuit in Boston. Lee then retreats to a tavern in Monmouth County , where he shares one last drink with Connor in silence before the latter fatally stabs him. William Johnson [ edit ] Main article: Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet Mezzotint engraving of Sir William Johnson, 1756 Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet (1715 – 11 July 1774) (voiced by Julian Casey) is an Anglo-Irish official of the British Empire , businessman, and member of the Colonial Rite of the Templar Order, who appears in both Assassin's Creed III and Assassin's Creed Rogue . He established many trading routes in the Thirteen Colonies , including with the Native Iroquois , with whom he developed good relations, and was appointed the British agent to the Iroquois and, later, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs. During the French and Indian War , he commanded both Iroquois and colonial militia forces against the French. In 1754, Johnson becomes the first Templar to be recruited for Haytham's expedition to search for the Isu's Grand Temple, due to his knowledge of the land and its Native people. He continues to serve with the Colonial Templars during the American Revolution , although in 1773 his business takes a major blow when a shipment of his British tea is dumped into the ocean by Connor and the Sons of Liberty , in what later became known as the Boston Tea Party . In 1774, Johnson holds a meeting with several Iroquois clan leaders at Johnson Hall , to negotiate the purchase of their land. However, the clan leaders perceive this as an attempt to subjugate them and refuse to comply to his demands, causing an annoyed Johnson to order the massacre of all clan leaders, only to be assassinated by Connor moments later. With his dying words, Johnson claims that he only sought to buy the Iroquois' land in order to protect it, and that with him gone, there will be no one left to defend the Iroquois from the colonists.

Hickey is first seen in Boston in 1754 as William Johnson 's assistant and aids in Haytham's search for the Isu's Grand Temple. In 1776, during the Revolutionary War, Hickey is ordered by the Templars to assassinate George Washington in order to allow Charles Lee to replace him as Commander-in-Chief . Connor uncovers the plot and attempts to kill Hickey in New York , where the latter runs a secret counterfeit ring. However, both men are arrested by the Patriots and sent to Bridewell Prison , where the Templars manage to get Hickey pardoned and frame Connor for the plot against Washington, causing him to be sentenced to death and creating the perfect opportunity to murder Washington, who will be attending the execution. However, Connor is able to escape his execution and kill Hickey before he can get to Washington. With his dying words, Hickey mocks Connor for fighting for ideals instead of personal gain and claims that, while Connor's hands will always be empty, he had lived his life to its fullest.

He is also a member of the Colonial Rite of the Templar Order, and conspires with his fellow Templars to stage attacks on American ships as a means of pressuring the Continental Congress into naming him an Admiral, thus giving the Templars more control over the nation's fledging naval service. Due to his intervention in the Assassin ships' trades and factory prices, Biddle is hunted down by Connor and Robert Faulkner, who eventually manage to catch him off the coast of the Bahamas in 1778. After a naval battle, Connor boards Biddle's ship, the USS Randolph , and mortally wounds him in combat.

Alongside Reginald Birch, he secretly engineered the murder of Edward Kenway in 1735, and became acquainted with Haytham while ostensibly searching for the perpetrators. In 1747, Haytham identifies one of the attackers as Tom Smith, a mercenary in Braddock's employ, but the latter is executed before Haytham can interrogate him, ostensibly for desertion (in reality Braddock was trying to cover up any loose ends regarding Edward's murder). Haytham then serves under Braddock for some time, during which the former notices Braddock becoming more brutal in his methods and distancing himself from the Templars' ideals, losing his trust in him. By 1754, Braddock has completely abandoned the Order and has been sent to serve in the Thirteen Colonies .

Characters of Assassin's Creed III: Liberation [ edit ] Aveline de Grandpré [ edit ] Main article: Aveline de Grandpré Aveline de Grandpré (20 June 1747 – unknown) (voiced by Amber Goldfarb) is the protagonist of Assassin's Creed III: Liberation and the Aveline downloadable content (DLC) for Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag . She is a Louisiana Creole Assassin active in and around New Orleans [ 128 ] during the mid- and late 18th-century who battles the Templars' attempts to take control of the region. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] The daughter of a wealthy French merchant and his African placée , Aveline dedicates herself to liberating oppressed slaves from a young age. [ 131 ] Her fight for freedom eventually catches the attention of Agaté, the Mentor of the Louisiana Brotherhood of Assassins, who recruits Aveline to the Assassins in 1759 and subsequently trains her, although their relationship would deteriorate over time due to Aveline's disobedience and Agaté's secrecy. [ 128 ] Aveline elects to keep her Assassin life hidden from her family, with the only person to be aware of it being her childhood friend Gérald Blanc, who was also recruited by Agaté. During her mission to eliminate the Templar Order, Aveline would meet and befriend her fellow Assassin Connor , who after the end of the American Revolutionary War , enlists her help in finding and recruiting new Assassins in order to rebuild the Colonial Brotherhood. Gérald Blanc [ edit ] Gérald Blanc (1745 – unknown) (voiced by Olivier Lamarche) is Aveline's childhood friend and closest confidant, who works as an accountant for Aveline's father, Philippe Olivier de Grandpré, and was also recruited into the Assassin Brotherhood by Agaté. Born in Acadia , Gérald was orphaned at a young age during the Great Expulsion and moved to New Orleans , where he was found and employed by Philippe, initially as a simple errand boy. Unlike Aveline, who was trained by Agaté to handle field work for the Brotherhood, Gérald was trained as an information officer and runs a spy network in New Orleans that acquires information to aid Aveline's missions. Gérald cares a lot about Aveline and harbors romantic feelings for her, which the latter is aware of but does not seem to reciprocate, believing they shouldn't "mix work with feelings." Following Philippe's death in 1776, Gérald inherits his business, as Aveline was unable to, but assures her that the business will remain hers in everything but name. Agaté [ edit ] Agaté ( c. 1722 – 1777) (voiced by Tristan D. Lalla) is a former slave and the Mentor of the Louisiana Brotherhood of Assassins, who primarily operates from his hideout in the Louisiana Bayou . Born in Africa, Agaté was enslaved from a young age and, while working on a plantation in Saint-Domingue , befriended two other slaves, Baptiste and Jeanne (Aveline's mother), falling in love with the latter. All three eventually encountered revolutionary disruptor François Mackandal , who taught them the ways of the Assassins. In 1738, Agaté and Baptiste formally joined the Brotherhood and escaped the plantation with Mackandal, but Jeanne refused to do the same and stayed behind. Following their Mentor's death in 1758, Agaté abandoned Baptiste and traveled to Louisiana to establish his own Brotherhood, recruiting and training Aveline and Gérald Blanc to be his agents in New Orleans . Agaté cares for his students, especially Aveline, whom he sees as a daughter because of his past relationship with her mother, but is secretive in his dealings with them, causing Aveline to in turn disobey his orders regularly. Over the years, their mutual distrust of each another causes them to grow apart. When Aveline returns to Agaté in 1777 to reveal the identity of the true leader of Louisiana's Templar Order, he attacks her, believing her to have betrayed the Assassins. Aveline wins, causing Agaté, who is overwhelmed with humiliation, to leap to his death from the top of his treehouse. Philippe Olivier de Grandpré [ edit ] Philippe Olivier de Grandpré (1722 – 13 October 1776) (voiced by Marcel Jeannin) is a wealthy French merchant living in New Orleans and Aveline's father. Born in Nantes, France to a family of successful merchants, he traveled to Louisiana as a young man in search of new business opportunities and established a trading enterprise, shipping goods from the New World to the Old . In 1744, during a trade mission to Saint-Domingue , Philippe purchased a slave named Jeanne, whom he fell in love with and made his placée bride. In 1752, he was forced to marry Madeleine de L'Isle, the daughter of one of his investors, to alleviate his financial problems. Although Philippe assured Jeanne nothing would change between them, their relationship became strained over time, and Jeanne eventually disappeared under mysterious circumstances in 1757, causing Philippe to blame himself for driving her away. Philippe loves Aveline deeply and, although unaware of her double life as an Assassin, is nonetheless supportive of her life choices, such as her decision to remain unmarried and help run his business. After discovering signs of Templar interference in his business, Philippe is slowly poisoned by Madeleine, secretly the leader of the Louisiana Templars, and eventually passes away in 1776, leaving his estate to Madeleine and his business to Gérald Blanc. Jeanne [ edit ] Jeanne ( c. 1725 – unknown) (voiced by Lucinda Davis ) is an African former slave and Aveline's mother. Enslaved at a young age, she was sent to work on a plantation in Saint-Domingue , where she met two other slaves, Baptiste and Agaté, falling in love with the latter. While taught the ways of the Assassins by François Mackandal like Agaté and Baptiste, Jeanne opted not to join the Brotherhood due to its violent ways and remained on the plantation until 1744, when she was purchased by Philippe Olivier de Grandpré and moved with him to New Orleans . Having fallen in love with Philippe, she accepted to become his placée bride and gave birth to their daughter in 1747. However, the couple's relationship became strained after Philippe married Madeleine de L'Isle. Upon hearing rumors of Mackandal coming to Louisiana, Jeanne began to fear the Assassins coming after her to recover a stolen artifact known as the Heart of the Brotherhood, and enlisted Madeleine's help in fleeing Louisiana unnoticed. Madeleine arranged for her to be sent to an excavation site in Chichen Itza that was secretly run by the Templars, and in 1757 Jeanne abandoned her family without explanation; an act she would later come to regret. When Aveline comes to Chichen Itza in 1769 to investigate the Templars' activities, she is unexpectedly reunited with her mother, who realizes Aveline has become an Assassin and, assuming she was sent by Agaté to kill her, runs away. During Aveline's second visit to Chichen Itza in 1772, Jeanne, having accepted the life her daughter chose, tries to mend her relationship with her and apologizes for her earlier behavior, as well as abandoning Aveline and Philippe. Aveline forgives her mother and invites her to return to New Orleans, but Jeanne opts to remain in Chichen Itza, though she promises to stay in contact with her daughter. Élise Lafleur [ edit ] Élise Lafleur is a smuggler who, together with her partner Toussaint Roussillon, runs a smuggling operation in the Louisiana Bayou. She displays a sardonic and gruff personality and typically serves as the brains of the operation because of Roussillon rarely taking situations seriously. In 1766, when their operation begins to be threatened by Baptiste's followers, Élise and Roussillon encounter Aveline and help her track down Baptiste in order to put an end to his cult. From there, the two go on to become some of Aveline's most trusted allies as they assist her several more times, such as helping her investigate the mysterious disappearances of several slaves, sabotage an operation run by the Templar Diego Vázquez, and deliver a former slave named George Davidson to the Continental Army . Toussaint Roussillon [ edit ] Toussaint Roussillon (voiced by JB Blanc ) is a smuggler who, together with his partner Élise Lafleur, runs a smuggling operation in the Louisiana Bayou. In contrast to Élise's gruff personality, Roussillon is a good-natured jokester who rarely takes situations seriously; despite this, Élise feels indebted to him because he saved her life in the past. In 1766, when their operation begins to be threatened by Baptiste's followers, Roussillon and Élise come into contact with Aveline and help her track down Baptiste in order to put an end to his cult. From there, the two go on to become some of Aveline's most trusted allies as they assist her several more times, such as helping her investigate the mysterious disappearances of several slaves, sabotage an operation run by the Templar Diego Vázquez, and deliver a former slave named George Davidson to the Continental Army . Houngan [ edit ] The houngan (voiced by Dave Fennoy ) is an unnamed witch doctor living in San Danje, a small settlement in the Louisiana Bayou established by escaped slaves. He maintains a friendship with the smugglers Élise Lafleur and Toussaint Roussillon, who occasionally bring him supplies, and later also becomes an ally of Aveline, who consults him several times for his wisdom and knowledge of the general happenings in the area. Carlos Dominguez [ edit ] Carlos Dominguez (1730s – 1803) (voiced by Marcel Jeannin) is a Spanish ship captain hired by the Templar Rafael Joaquín de Ferrer to transport goods to and from New Orleans . While earning a small fortune from his employers, he spends most of it in taverns and is frequently drunk as a result. In 1765, Dominguez begins to redirect shipments meant for Gilbert-Antoine de St. Maxent , causing Philippe Olivier de Grandpré's shipping business to suffer. While investigating the missing shipments, Aveline charms Dominguez and then steals paperwork revealing the stolen goods' location while the latter is distracted. In 1768, Aveline tracks down Dominguez again and attempts to interrogate him to learn de Ferrer's plans for New Orleans, but is unable to because of Dominguez's drunken state. Later that same year, Aveline boards Domginguez's ship and attempts to destroy it in the hopes of luring Antonio de Ulloa out of hiding. Dominguez confronts and recognizes her, but after Aveline kills his guards, a terrified Domingues pleads for his life while promising to change his ways. Aveline spares Dominguez and later encounters him again at the docks. With his employment by the Templars terminated, Dominguez attempted to find other ways of earning money, only to be robbed by a trader he lent money to. After recovering Dominguez's money and helping him acquire a new ship, Aveline has Dominguez start working for her to repay his debt. Gilbert-Antoine de Saint Maxent [ edit ] Main article: Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent Gilbert-Antoine de Saint Maxent (1724 – 8 August 1794) (voiced by Arthur Holden ) was a French merchant and military officer who played a major role in the development of French and Spanish Louisiana , becoming one of the most affluent citizens of New Orleans . In the game, he is portrayed as a business partner of Philippe Olivier de Grandpré and makes several small appearances throughout the story. François Mackandal [ edit ] Main article: François Mackandal Mackandal on a 20 gourde coin, 1968 François Mackandal (died 20 January 1758) was a Haitian Maroon leader in the French colony of Saint-Domingue , as well as the Mentor of the Saint-Domingue Brotherhood of Assassins, mentioned several times in Assassin's Creed III: Liberation and Assassin's Creed Rogue . In 1732, he came into contact with Agaté, Baptiste, and Jeanne and began teaching them the ways of the Assassins. In 1738, Mackandal officially inducted the former two into the Brotherhood and helped them escape the plantation where they were forced to work. Mackandal would fight alongside Agaté and Baptiste for many years, during which time he also found several Isu artifacts, such as the Precursor box and the manuscript which could be used to decipher it, revealing the locations of various Isu temples around the world. However, these artifacts would be stolen by the Templars in 1751, after one of Mackandal's apprentices investigated an Isu temple and inadvertently triggered a massive earthquake that devastated Port-au-Prince . In 1758, Mackandal was burned at the stake following a failed attempt to poison the white colonists of Saint-Domingue, his public execution serving as a warning to both the Maroons and other Assassins. Madeleine de L'Isle [ edit ] Madeleine de L'Isle (1732 – 1777) (voiced by Leni Parker ) is the main antagonist of Assassin's Creed III: Liberation . She is the second wife of Philippe Olivier de Grandpré (though the first to be legally recognized) and Aveline's stepmother, as well as secretly the leader of the Louisiana Rite of the Templar Order, operating under the alias of the "Company Man." Born into a wealthy merchant family in New Orleans , Madeleine discovered the Templars' existence at a young age, and was inducted into the Order in 1747 after impressing them. Upon learning of the Heart of the Brotherhood stolen by Jeanne, she used her Templar connections to negatively affect the business of Jeanne's husband Philippe and then began courting him, eventually forcing Philippe to marry Madeleine in 1752 to alleviate his financial problems. From there, she attempted to get close to Jeanne in order to obtain the stolen artifact. When Jeanne requested Madeleine's help in fleeing Louisiana, the latter arranged for her to be sent to an excavation site in Chichen Itza , where the Templars were overseeing the search for Isu temples, using liberated slaves as their workforce. Jeanne's departure allowed Madeleine to grow closer to Aveline and, upon learning that her stepdaughter had joined the Assassins, she pretended to take an interest in Aveline's secret mission to help oppressed slaves; under the guise of "rescuing" them, Madeleine would send these slaves to the Templar worksite in Chichen Itza. In 1776, after Philippe discovers signs of Templar interference in his business, Madeleine secretly poisons him, allowing her to inherit of his estate after his death. She also requests that Aveline help an escaped slave named George Davidson, who was promised freedom in exchange for his loyalty to the Templars. When Aveline later assassinates George upon discovering his Templar affiliations, she learns from him that Madeleine is the elusive "Company Man" that she has been pursuing and confronts her. Madeleine reveals that she has been secretly grooming Aveline to become a Templar and asks her to kill her mentor Agaté to prove her loyalty to the Order. When Aveline returns with evidence of Agaté's death and the Prophecy Disk (the Isu artifact which the Templars sought in Chichen Itza), Madeleine prepares to induct her stepdaughter into the Order, only to be killed by her, ending the Louisiana Templars. Rafael Joaquín de Ferrer [ edit ] Rafael Joaquín de Ferrer (1730s – 1769) is the secondary antagonist of Assassin's Creed III: Liberation . He is a Spanish Templar and the right-hand man of Madeleine de L'Isle. Born into a family that had long been loyal to the Templar Order, de Ferrer was sent to Cuba in 1750 to search for a Precursor box. After seducing the Assassin Rhona Dinsmore to steal her maps of the Yucatán Peninsula , de Ferrer searched the peninsula for the box, only to stumble upon the Maya city of Chichen Itza , which he was convinced had been built atop several ancient Isu temples. Over the following two decades, de Ferrer oversaw the excavation of the city using liberated slaves as his workforce, which were provided to him by Madeleine. Although de Ferrer would inflict harsh punishments or even execute any slave attempting to flee, most were oblivious to this fact and saw their lives on the worksite not as enslavement, but as being part of a peaceful community. In 1765, de Ferrer travels to New Orleans to acquire more workers for his site, as well as help Madeleine with her plans to take control of the city. To this end, he forges alliances with Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie and Baptiste, though both of these would fall through after the two men are assassinated by Aveline. In 1769, de Ferrer, upon returning to Chichen Itza, finally manages to locate an Isu temple containing one piece of an artifact called the Prophecy Disk, but is confronted by Aveline, who infiltrated the worksite disguised as a slave. In the ensuing fight, Aveline manages to kill de Ferrer and secure the Prophecy Disk piece. Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie [ edit ] Main article: Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie Governor Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie (1726 – 4 February 1765) (voiced by Bruce Dinsmore ) was the French Governor of Louisiana from February 1763 until his death two years later. His administration primarily focused on systematically dismantling the French garrison to prepare the colony for occupation by English and Spanish forces, pursuant to the terms of the Treaty of Paris . In the game, d'Abbadie is portrayed as an ally of the Templar Order and makes a deal with Rafael Joaquín de Ferrer to hand over Louisiana to Templar plants within the Spanish government, who would allow d'Abbadie to remain in power and keep the colony French in exchange for providing de Ferrer with slaves for his worksite in Chichen Itza . However, this plan falls through when d'Abbadie is assassinated by Aveline in 1765. Baptiste [ edit ] Baptiste (1725 – 23 June 1766) (voiced by Kwasi Songui ) is a voodoo leader and former Assassin operating in the Louisiana Bayou. Baptiste was born on a sugar plantation in Saint-Domingue , where he met two other slaves, Agaté and Jeanne, befriending the former. All three eventually came into contact with revolutionary disruptor François Mackandal , who taught them the ways of the Assassins. In 1738, Baptiste and Agaté formally joined the Brotherhood and escaped the plantation with Mackandal, fighting by his side for many years. Following their Mentor's death in 1758, Agaté abandoned Baptiste and traveled to Louisiana to establish his own Brotherhood. Feeling betrayed, Baptiste left the Assassins and followed Agaté to Louisiana, where he formed his own voodoo cult. To attract more followers, he decided to start impersonating Mackandal, going so far as to amputate his arm to resemble his former Mentor. He also sought to continue Mackandal's work by poisoning the nobility of New Orleans . In 1766, Baptiste makes a deal with the Templar Rafael Joaquín de Ferrer to locate Agaté and deliver him to de Ferrer, who in return would have Baptiste inducted into the Templar Order. To draw his former friend out of hiding, Baptiste has his followers set up many encampments throughout the Louisiana Bayou, threatening the smuggling operation run by Élise Lafleur and Toussaint Roussillon. The two later join forces with Aveline to locate Baptiste's hideout, where the voodoo leader is assassinated by Aveline amidst a ceremony with his followers. Baptiste also appears in a deleted scene in the 2016 Assassin's Creed film , portrayed by Michael K. Williams (who also plays his descendant, Moussa). [ 132 ] Antonio de Ulloa [ edit ] Main article: Antonio de Ulloa Portrait of Antonio de Ulloa by Andrés Cortés (1856) Antonio de Ulloa (12 January 1716 – 3 July 1795) was a Spanish naval officer, explorer, scientist, and administrator who served as the first Spanish Governor of Louisiana beginning with 1766. His rule was strongly resisted by the French Creole colonists in New Orleans , who expelled him from the city in the Louisiana Rebellion of 1768 . In the game, de Ulloa is portrayed as a secret member of the Templar Order, acting primarily as a scientific adviser. During his tenure as governor of Louisiana, he imposes strict trading restrictions, allows French officials to continue operating in New Orleans, and sets up a covert slave-trading operation, which is meant to provide the Templar excavation site in Chichen Itza with new workers. As a result, he is targeted by Aveline, who helps to incite the Louisiana Rebellion to draw de Ulloa out of hiding. While attempting to flee New Orleans, de Ulloa is attacked by Aveline and tells her about the Chichen Itza worksite in an attempt to save himself. Aveline ultimately spares the governor's life (despite having been ordered to kill him) and allows him to leave the city, but warns him that his Templar superiors will not be as forgiving about his betrayal and advises him to leave the continent for his and his family's safety. De Ulloa would take Aveline's advice and go into exile, retiring from both public life and Templar service in favor of a career in the Spanish Navy. Diego Vázquez [ edit ] Diego Vázquez (died 13 October 1776) (voiced by Conrad Pla ) is a Spanish Templar who attempts to take control of the Louisiana Bayou in 1771, but his efforts are thwarted by Aveline and her allies.

However, George ends up abandoning the Patriots and joining the Loyalists , enlisting in Lord Dunmore 's Ethiopian Regiment , which promised freedom to all slaves who joined. In 1777, Aveline travels to the New York frontier in search of a Loyalist officer and Templar who possesses information regarding the identity of the elusive Templar known as the "Company Man." Upon discovering the officer is George, the latter attempts to flee, but Aveline blows up his carriage and mortally wounds him. With his dying words, George claims that he chose his own destiny and tells Aveline that the "Company Man" has been "in her own backyard all along", leading Aveline to realize the "Company Man" is none other than Madeleine.

There, Edward would father another child, Haytham Kenway , with his second wife, Tessa Stephenson-Oakley, and join the British Brotherhood, eventually rising through its ranks to become its co-leader. He also establishes his own commercial enterprise, which he uses as cover to travel around the world and search for more Isu sites like the Observatory. In 1735, Edward is killed in his family estate by mercenaries in the employ of Reginald Birch, his property manager and, secretly, the Grand Master of the British Templars, who sought to acquire Edward's journal detailing his research of the Isu. Edward is the grandfather of Connor and an ancestor of Desmond Miles through the paternal line. Mary Read [ edit ] Main article: Mary Read In Black Flag , Mary Read is introduced posing as James Kidd, the fictional son of William Kidd , which mirrors her real-life counterpart dressing as a man for most of her life.

Through the use of acting, showmanship and stunts such as lighting fuses in his hair and growing his beard long, he has cultivated a reputation of himself as a ferocious, bloodthirsty pirate so that he could intimidate his enemies into submission whilst avoiding violence. As the Pirate Republic begins to collapse in 1717, Thatch and Edward work together to try and save it, but their efforts prove futile when Nassau is later blockaded by the British in 1718. Admitting his dream is over, Thatch decides to retire from piracy and goes on one last pirating spree to fund his retirement. However, this catches the attention of the British authorities and, while Edward is visiting Thatch in North Carolina to convince him to re-join the Pirate Republic, they are attacked by a fleet of British ships. Edward tries to help Thatch fight them off, but the pirates are ultimately overwhelmed and Thatch is killed in battle while Edward is forced to escape.

As the republic begins to collapse in 1717, Hornigold argues with the other founders, as he is the only one who considers accepting the King 's pardon and retiring from piracy. When Nassau is blockaded by the British in 1718, Hornigold meets with Woodes Rogers , the new governor of the Bahamas and a Templar, and accepts the pardon. Hornigold ends up joining the Templar Order himself due to sharing their ideals of order and purpose instead of blindly pursuing freedom like his fellow pirates, and becomes a pirate hunter, causing him to be seen as a traitor by his former allies. While attempting to kill Edward in 1719, Hornigold is lured to the Swan Islands , where he is ultimately assassinated by his former friend.

While attempting to capture the Sage, Bartholomew Roberts , who could lead them to the Observatory, Vane's quartermaster, Jack Rackham , stages a mutiny and has Vane and Edward marooned on the deserted island of Isla Providencia. During his time on the island, Vane is driven mad with desperation and turns on his former friend, who defeats and subsequently abandons him.

Despite his infamy, he earned the nickname of "The Gentleman Pirate", due in part to the fact that he was a moderately wealthy landowner prior to turning to piracy, owning a profitable sugar plantation in Barbados. In the game, Bonnet is portrayed as a jolly and gracious, if somewhat naive man, who greatly values his friends. He is first encountered by Edward Kenway prior to his turn to piracy, in Cape Bonavista, where Bonnet's ship, the Revenge , was waylaid by British authorities under suspicion of having been involved in a nearby naval battle (which Edward himself had taken part in).

However, the couple did not let others' opinions stand in the way of their relationship, and eventually got married in 1712. While Caroline's mother was somewhat supportive of her daughter's marriage, her father Emmett, secretly a Templar, resented Caroline's decision and did everything in his power to try and break her and Edward up. Although Caroline was content with her modest life on the farm of Edward's parents, the latter dreamed of becoming a successful privateer and was unsatisfied with being unable to provide for his wife.

Following his return to Port-au-Prince in 1735, Godin meets with the governor of Saint-Domingue , Pierre, Marquis de Fayet , and tries to convince him to provide more funding and a ship for the expedition. Although aware that Godin embezzled the money that had been originally given to him, de Fayet nonetheless agrees to his request, as the success of the expedition would make the slave trade more efficient. Before Godin's departure, Adéwalé secretly infiltrates the expedition and replaces its illiterate slaves with literate Maroons , so that the Maroons and Assassins could also learn about any discoveries made during the expedition.

When Adéwalé begins to aid the Maroon rebellion in 1735, freeing numerous slaves, de Fayet retaliates by severely punishing the still-imprisoned slaves to discourage future Maroon attacks. Adéwalé eventually decides to put an end to the brutality and assassinates the governor in Port-au-Prince in 1737. Despite being warned by Bastienne Josèphe that another tyrant will simply take de Fayet's place, Adéwalé believes that his death will give hope to both the Maroons and the imprisoned slaves.

During his time as an Assassin apprentice, Shay is disrespected by most of his superiors, and comes to question the Brotherhood's goals and morality after being ordered to eliminate a number of Templars regardless of circumstances. Eventually, after his mission to retrieve a Piece of Eden from Lisbon inadvertently results in a devastating earthquake that destroys the city, Shay completely loses faith in the Assassins and betrays them in 1756. Upon being found by the Templars, he agrees to work with them to stop the Assassins from endangering more innocent lives during the French and Indian War , and is eventually inducted into the Templar Order in 1758. Over the following few years, Shay becomes a skilled Assassin hunter as he kills most of his former allies, helping the Templars purge the Colonial Brotherhood and increase their own influence in the American Colonies . Once most of the Colonial Brotherhood has been eliminated by 1760, Shay is sent to Europe to track down a Precursor box in the Assassins' possession, a mission which would take him over 16 years to complete, as he only manages to retrieve the box in 1776, after killing the Assassin Charles Dorian (the father of Arno Dorian ) at the Palace of Versailles . While Shay makes no further appearances in the Assassin's Creed franchise, he is referenced in the 2016 novel Assassin's Creed: Last Descendants through his grandson Cudgel Cormac, a professional Assassin hunter who continued his grandfather's legacy in protecting the Templar cause during the American Civil War .

During Shay's time as an Assassin, Liam briefly serves as his quartermaster aboard the Morrigan , and is later present for his friend's betrayal and theft of the Voynich manuscript. In 1757, Liam assassinates the Templar George Monro to recover the manuscript, allowing the Assassins to use it in conjunction with their Precursor box to discover the locations of a number of Isu temples. It is during this time that Liam learns of Shay's survival (having thought him to be dead after being shot by Chevalier de la Vérendrye ) and defection to the Templars, and he comes to despise Shay for killing a number of Assassins who had once been his friends. In 1760, Liam accompanies Achilles to the Arctic Ocean to investigate an Isu temple, leading to a confrontation with Shay and Haytham Kenway . Liam battles his former friend and is mortally wounded after falling from a cliff.

Within the Brotherhood, Hope leads several gangs that control most of New York's organized crime, thus providing the Assassins with an effective information network. She is also one of Shay's instructors, and is disappointed by his stubbornness that she feels hinders his potential. Following Shay's betrayal of the Brotherhood and defection to the Templars, he works to reduce Hope's control over New York's underworld, believing that her gangs pose a threat to the safety of the city's population, and eventually manages to assassinate her in 1759, after manipulating the British Army into attacking her mansion to draw her out.

Through Kesegowaase, the Brotherhood would gain allies within nearly every French-aligned Native American tribe. After the outbreak of the French and Indian War , Kesegowaase and Liam are tasked with eliminating the Templar George Monro , but after failing to kill him during the Siege of Fort William Henry , the former rallies his men and attacks Albany, New York .

In 1760, de la Vérendrye acts as a decoy to lead the Templars away from Achilles Davenport and Liam O'Brien while the two head to the Arctic Ocean to investigate an Isu temple. After de la Vérendrye and his fleet are cornered by the Templars off the coast of Newfoundland , Shay, who had survived his fall and went on to join the Templars, boards his ship, Le Gerfaut , and mortally wounds him in battle.

In 1757, he is killed by the Assassin Liam O'Brien during an attack on Albany, New York , in order to retrieve the Voynich manuscript that was given to him by Shay.

In the game, Cook is depicted as a captain of the Royal Navy and master of HMS Pembroke during the French and Indian War , and an unwitting ally of the Templar Order. He provides assistance to Shay and Haytham Kenway during their campaigns against the French, and is oblivious to the true nature of the Assassin-Templar conflict, as the Templars opt to keep him in the dark regarding their Order's existence, believing Cook's character to be too honest to adequately keep secrets. After helping Shay locate and kill Chevalier de la Vérendrye in 1760, Cook takes the latter's maps of Newfoundland , which he would later use during his own expeditions in the area, and is promised a sponsorship to fund his voyages to discover new lands by Haytham, ostensibly on behalf of the British government. Jack Weeks [ edit ] Jack Weeks (1723 – unknown) (voiced by Ralph Prosper ) is an African-American member of the British and Colonial Rites of the Templar Order.

In 1751, while visiting the Caribbean to treat his tuberculosis , Lawrence discovers the hideout of the Saint-Domingue Brotherhood of Assassins, led by François Mackandal , after one of Mackandal's apprentices inadvertently triggers a devastating earthquake while attempting to retrieve a Piece of Eden. From Mackandal's camp, Lawrence is able to steal two Isu artifacts—the Precursor box and the Voynich manuscript—which he later gives to his fellow Templars Samuel Smith and James Wardrop during a garden party at Mount Vernon in July 1752.

Inspired by Grand Master Jacques de Molay, Germain seeks to carry out the "Great Work" and create a capitalist society in which the Templars could more easily control the populace. De la Serre regards his ideas as being too radical, and exiles him from the Order. Germain turns de la Serre's advisors to his cause, forming a radical faction within the Templar Order. In 1789, he has de la Serre assassinated in the Palace of Versailles, taking most of the Order under his control.

Born to a minor noble family in Norway , Eivor is adopted by King Styrbjorn of the Raven Clan after her biological parents are killed in a raid by a rival Viking clan, during which Eivor is attacked and scarred by a wolf, leading to her nickname of " Wolf-Kissed ". The friendship between Eivor and her adoptive brother Sigurd is central to Valhalla 's story, the events of which are set in motion when the siblings, dissatisfied with the Unification of Norway in 872, decide to leave their homeland and sail to England . There, they establish their own settlement called Ravensthorpe together with other loyalists in the Raven Clan, which Eivor subsequently attempts to expand by forming alliances with neighboring Saxon kingdoms and Viking clans. While doing so, she becomes acquainted with the Hidden Ones, a precursor organization to the Assassin Brotherhood , and agrees to help them fight the growing influence of their sworn enemies, the Order of the Ancients (precursors to the Templar Order , the series' perennial antagonists). Eivor is also the protagonist of two of Valhalla 's story-driven expansions : Wrath of the Druids , where she travels to Ireland to help her cousin Bárid mac Ímair earn the favor of the High King of Ireland , Flann Sinna , and dismantles a druid cult called the Children of Danu ; and The Siege of Paris , where she heads to Francia to partake in the titular siege and neutralize the threat posed by Emperor Charles the Fat .

Born in Samarra during the 9th century, Basim is the son of the architect responsible for the creation of the Great Mosque of Samarra , though his father was exiled and died in poverty after someone else took credit for his work. Orphaned and alone, Basim becomes a small-time thief to survive on the streets of Baghdad until meeting the Hidden One Roshan, who inducts him into the Brotherhood and becomes his mentor, though the two would eventually have a falling out, resulting in Roshan leaving the Hidden Ones. Later in life, Basim becomes a mentor himself, taking Hytham as his first apprentice, and discovers he is the reincarnation of the Isu Loki , who betrayed his fellow Isu after Odin imprisoned his and Aletheia's son, Fenrir . Seeking revenge against the reincarnation of Odin on Loki's behalf, Basim meets Sigurd Styrbjornsson in Constantinople and, believing him to be Odin's reincarnation, accompanies him back to Norway , where he meets Sigurd's adoptive sister, Eivor Varinsdottir. Realizing Sigurd is actually the reincarnation of Tyr and Eivor is Odin's reincarnation, Basim formulates a plan to win their trust and accompanies them to England, where he and Hytham train Eivor in the Hidden Ones' ways and enlist her help in eliminating the local branch of the Order of the Ancients. After finding a Piece of Eden, the Saga Stone, Basim uses it to awaken Tyr's dormant memories in Sigurd, causing a rift in his and Eivor's friendship, and eventually follows the pair to an Isu temple in Norway, where he reveals his true intentions to kill Eivor. However, Basim is defeated by Eivor and Sigurd and trapped in the Grey, the Isu's simulated afterlife, where he remains until 2020, when Loki and Aletheia's plan finally comes to fruition and Basim is freed by Layla Hassan in exchange for helping her save the planet from certain doom. Basim subsequently abandons Layla in the Grey and rejuvenates his physical body using the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus , which was brought by Layla and contains Aletheia's consciousness.

In the late 9th century, while tracking an Order member named Al-Si'la to England, Roshan encounters Eivor Varinsdottir, who helps her kill Al-Si'la and her puppet, the so-called "Earl of Westerna", Edward, who had threatened Eivor's clan.

Isu (major characters) [ edit ] See also: 2012 phenomenon , Ancient astronauts , Ancient astronauts in popular culture , Global catastrophe scenarios , Norse mythology , and Norse mythology in popular culture Minerva [ edit ] See also: Menrva and Minerva Minerva (voiced by Margaret Easley ), also known as Merva or Mera , is the first a member of the Isu, otherwise known as the "First Civilization", introduced in the series. She is a member of the Capitoline Triad , a renowned scientific group, along with Juno and Jupiter. In Assassin's Creed II , Minerva appears to Ezio via a pre-recorded hologram inside the Vatican Vault in 1499. Knowing that Desmond will eventually relive Ezio's memories, Minerva uses the latter as a conduit to pass on her message. She explains that her kind are not gods, but a more advanced civilization whose technology was mistaken for magic. They engineered humans as slaves, but they rebelled. Minerva describes how war with humanity, combined with a devastating cataclysmic event, led to the downfall of their civilization and the extinction of their race. She correctly predicted that a second cataclysmic event would eventually occur, and she hid away the tools humanity would need to survive in several vaults around the world, devising a system by which they could communicate across time before they eventually died. She instructs Desmond to find the vaults, then disappears, leaving a confused Ezio in her wake. In Assassin's Creed III , she projects herself through the past one last time and finds Desmond in the Vault. She warns him about Juno's power-hungry ambitions, hoping that he will decide not to save the world and keep Juno imprisoned. Juno turns the tables and forces Minerva to reveal Desmond's destiny and how his legacy will be manipulated if he allows the cataclysm to happen. During her own natural lifetime, Minerva—known to adherents of Norse mythology as Gunlodr —met with the Isu leader Odin and played an unwitting part in his plot to survive the Great Catastrophe. Juno [ edit ] See also: Juno (mythology) and Uni (mythology) Juno (voiced by Nadia Verrucci), alternately known as Uni , is a member of the Capitoline Triad introduced in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood . Although she reiterates Minerva's warning to Desmond, she is far more hostile and contemptuous of humanity. After Desmond recovers an Apple of Eden hidden by Ezio in the Roman Colosseum, Juno takes control of Desmond, forces him to kill Lucy, and instructs him to find "the one who would accompany you through the gate". In Assassin's Creed III, after Desmond kills Warren and Daniel, she takes the place of the modern-day main antagonist. It is revealed that Juno sought to conquer the rejuvenating world. When she tried to use Minerva's technology for her own ends, she was found and imprisoned in the Vault, with the other two members of the Triad hoping that she would fade away in time for the devices there to be activated safely. However, she endured, and she confronts Desmond and Minerva when the time comes to use the device. Juno spurs Minerva into showing the inevitable future if Desmond does not activate the device: humanity will start out well, and then sink back into their old ways and repeat the cycle all over again. Desmond decides to use the device, preventing the apocalypse, even though this would release Juno and cost him his life. Juno is released, and thanks Desmond's body before leaving her prison. She reappears later in Assassin's Creed Syndicate , where she ascends to leadership of the Instruments of the First Will, a sect of Isu worshippers who are loyal to her search for a way to restore her physical form. Juno was killed by Charlotte de la Cruz after gaining a physical form. During her own natural lifetime, Juno—known to adherents of Norse mythology as Hyrrokin —met with Odin and willingly aided him in his plot to survive the Great Catastrophe in exchange for assistance in restoring to life her lost love, Aita. Jupiter [ edit ] See also: Jupiter (mythology) and Tinia Jupiter (voiced by Peter Renaday ), also known as Tinia , is a member of the Capitoline Triad. He appears to Desmond in Assassin's Creed: Revelations during the Nexus of Time. He elaborates more on the creation of the vaults, and shows the location of the central vault that contains all their accumulated knowledge. Although the humans tend to use his Roman name, Minerva refers to him by his Etruscan name, Tinia. During his own natural lifetime, Jupiter—known to adherents of Norse mythology as Suttungr —led a faction of Isu that Norse mythology would come to know as the Jötunheimr , or "giants". At one point the Jotunheimr waged war with an opposing faction of Isu known as the Aesir, led by Odin. Despite this, Jupiter welcomed his Aesir counterpart during the latter's visit to his realm and hosted a feast in his honor. Aita [ edit ] Main article: Aita Aita was Juno's husband who volunteered to be a test subject for one of the Capitoline Triad's attempts to preserve the First Civilization. The experiment that he took part in is left vague, but Juno suggests that it preserved his body at the cost of his mind. Juno euthanized him when his mind "became brittle". He appears in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag as Bartholomew and John; Bartholomew is killed by Edward, while John commits suicide by forcing Abstergo security to shoot him; the latter's body is then taken by Abstergo to use in the Phoenix Project. Aita is subsequently reborn as the Sage in the form of Jacques de Molay and François-Thomas Germain in Assassin's Creed Unity , and an unnamed German spymaster working in London during the events of Assassin's Creed Syndicate . As Germain, he attempts to purge the Templar Order of complacency and restore its original purpose. As the German spymaster, his objectives are unknown, but as he is assassinated by Lydia Frye relatively quickly, it is noted that he was a particularly ineffective Sage. As the Sage, Aita is closely tied to the Instruments of the First Will, a cult worshipping Juno that believes humanity should be subservient to the Precursor race. Aita is the Etruscan name for Hades and Pluto . Aletheia [ edit ] Main article: Veritas Aletheia , known to adherents of Norse mythology as Angrboda , is an apparent sympathizer to the humans. She criticizes her fellow Isu for their treatment of their "useful apes", and reveals her disdain for their artifacts made to control the human populace. Trying to convince other Isu to join her cause, she praises the humans' achievements, among which includes the development of democracy and diplomacy. She implores the others to stop cowering before renouncing her position, not wanting to "be part of [their] exploitation" anymore. Before her death, she digitizes her consciousness into the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus , so that she can commune with Layla Hassan in the present and guide her on the path to become the "Heir of Memories". [ 169 ] It is eventually revealed that Aletheia's actions were all part of a plot for her to reunite with her lover Loki, and to obtain vengeance against Odin for the imprisonment of their son Fenrir. Odin [ edit ] See also: Odin Odin , sometimes known as Havi , is an Isu ruler and leader of the Aesir, a nation of the Isu, in the years leading up to the Great Catastrophe. Introduced in Assassin's Creed Valhalla , Odin is determined to avoid his own fated death during the Great Catastrophe, known to the Aesir as Ragnarök . Selfish and deceitful, but loyal, Odin's obsession with avoiding his fated death causes him to imprison Loki's son Fenrir, and betray his brother, Tyr. With Juno's assistance, Odin succeeds in finding a way for him and a few trusted followers to survive Ragnarok through reincarnation. Odin is reincarnated in Eivor Varinsdottir, a 9th-century Viking raider who becomes embroiled in the Assassin – Templar conflict central to the series. Tyr [ edit ] See also: Týr Tyr is an Isu, a member of the Aesir nation, and close friend to Odin. Chief lawgiver of the Aesir, Tyr works tirelessly to keep the peace between Odin and Loki, the latter having betrayed the Aesir by fathering the child Fenrir with Aletheia. Tyr is betrayed by Odin during Fenrir's imprisonment and loses an arm in the process, but he is among Odin's counted few to be reincarnated after Ragnarök. He is eventually reincarnated in Sigurd Styrbjornsson, the adopted brother of Eivor Varinsdottir. Loki [ edit ] See also: Loki Loki (voiced by Carlo Rota ) is an Isu, a member of the Aesir nation, and Aletheia's lover. As Fenrir's father, he seeks vengeance against Odin for his son's imprisonment. After betraying Odin, Loki is forbidden from joining his fellow Aesir in reincarnating after Ragnarök, but he formulates a plan with Aletheia that will allow them both to survive the coming catastrophe; while Aletheia transfers her consciousness into the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus , Loki uses the same device used by the other Aesir to reincarnate in the body of Basim Ibn Ishaq, who retains all of Loki's memories.
