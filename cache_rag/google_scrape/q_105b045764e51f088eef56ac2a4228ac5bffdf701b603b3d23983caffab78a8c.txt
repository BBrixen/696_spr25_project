[ 1 ] The winner was announced on 12 October 2018, [ 2 ] the prize being given to the Guadeloupean-French author Maryse Condé , who was praised by the jury as a "grand storyteller [whose] authorship belongs to world literature, describing the ravages of colonialism and the postcolonial chaos in a language which is both precise and overwhelming."

[ 10 ] The jury said in its citation: "Maryse Condé is a grand storyteller. Her authorship belongs to world literature. In her work, she describes the ravages of colonialism and the postcolonial chaos in a language which is both precise and overwhelming. The magic the dream and the terror is as also love constantly present. Fiction and reality overlap each other and people live as much in an imagined world with long and complicated traditions as the ongoing present. Respectfully and with humour she narrates the postcolonial insanity disruption and abuse but also human solidarity and warmth The dead live in her stories closely to the living in a multitudinous world where gender race and class are constantly turned over in new constellations." [ 3 ] Maryse Condé received the prize on 10 December 2018 at a ceremony at Berns salonger in Stockholm . The prize sum, 320 000 Swedish crowns, was created through crowdfunding and sponsorship . [ 3 ] Condé, a writer from Guadeloupe , was particularly noted for her novels Segu (1984), Tree of Life: A Novel of the Caribbean (1987) and Windward Heights (1995). [ 3 ] When Condé died in 2024, The Guardian obituary of her noted that she had considered this award an especially important achievement and that she had dedicated the prize to all the people of Guadeloupe, saying: "We are such a small country, only mentioned when there are hurricanes or earthquakes and things like that. Now we are so happy to be recognised for something else." [ 11 ] Reactions [ edit ] The establishment of the prize caused several negative reactions in Swedish media, some criticizing the New Academy's intention to award "morally good literature" and cultural journalist Göran Sommardal called the prize "pathetic". [ 12 ] Swedish author Ulf Lundell , himself one of the 47 nominees for the prize, said he thought that "no author of any self-preservation will accept it". [ 12 ] Internationally, reactions were more positive, Alison Flood wrote in The Guardian : "Perhaps the most striking detail of all is found not in the names, but the fine print. The New Academy is enforcing a gender quota on the shortlist stage, stipulating that it comprises two men and two women. How different this is to the Nobel, which counts among its 114 winners just 14 women", and also praised the nomination process of public votes: "How open. How inclusive."
