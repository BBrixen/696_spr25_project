Members Online • SansIdee_pseudo Most unexpected major win (women) Discussion -Serena at the 2007 Australian Open: she came in as ranked no 81, only played 4 tournaments in 2006 because of knee injury and depression. Pat Cash said she was a "lost cause". She had some tough matches along the way, but destroyed Sharapova, then no 1, 6-1 6-2 in the final. This match really reignited her career. She also won it with a prototype racket, which was significant as it marked her move away from oversized rackets (she used a 113 squ. inc. head size at the 2006 US Open) to a 104 squ. inc. head size. -Marion Bartoli at 2013 Wimbledon: she came in seeded 15th. She had reached the final in 2007 and the qf in 2011, but very few thought she could win that year. Serena was the heavy favorite, as she was the defending champion and world no 1. She was upset by Sabine Lisciki, 2011 semifinalist, in the 4th round. This tournaments was marked by most of the top seeds being upset. Marion cruised to the final without losing a set. She defeated Lisciki 6-1 6-4, which was an almost identical score to the final which she lost to Venus Williams in 2007 (4-6 1-6). Both finals featured low seeds (2007: Bartoli 18th seed, Venus 23rd seed, 2013: Bartoli 15th seed, Lisciki 23rd seed). I'm sure there are others. I don't know the men's game as well.
