Full Review | Jan 15, 2025 JD Duran InSession Film Guillermo del Toro’s The Shape of Water is a beautiful and fully realized film about loneliness and our desire for love. Full Review | Aug 7, 2024 Diana Tuova Spotlight on Film Del Toro has made a film whose dark, sublime, watery beauty is indisputable, and whose story is as much an intriguing "beauty-and-the-beast" ballad as it is a captivating homage to the different and the extraordinary. Full Review | Original Score: 4.5/5                                  | Aug 2, 2024 Denise Pieniazek Metacultura (AR) However, while The Creature from the Black Lagoon was darker, in The Shape of Water he is a more humanized and warm being, here he is the victim and not a threat, the typical scheme that we know from King Kong (1933) is no longer repeated. Full Review | Original Score: 10/10                                  | Dec 28, 2023 Mark Johnson Awards Daily The meticulous craftsmanship is to be expected in any del Toro film and only adds to the magic spell he puts us under. Full Review | Jun 27, 2023 Jennifer Bisset CNET It balances a harsh 1960s setting with fairy tale magic painted into its big, beautifully-detailed sets. Only del Toro could pull this madness off. Full Review | Apr 20, 2023 Chris Bennion Times (UK) You’ll either be charmed by Hawkins’s ethereal, wordless performance or you won’t, but del Toro’s use of a vivid colour palette would impress anyone. Full Review | Feb 14, 2023 Brian T. Carney Washington Blade Touching and surreal... Full Review | Dec 15, 2022 Keith Garlington Keith & the Movies There is no subtlety whatsoever. You can practically hear del Toro beating his pulpit through much of Shannon’s dialogue. Full Review | Original Score: 2.5/5                                  | Aug 25, 2022 Brian Eggert Deep Focus Review With a narrative that resonates in unexpected ways, the film offers a showcase for the talents of its stunning ensemble cast, especially Hawkins, who embodies innocence without becoming a symbol or losing her humanity. Full Review | Original Score: 4/4                                  | Mar 16, 2022 David Gonzalez The Cinematic Reel The Shape Of Water is another success for Del Toro, who has yet to received a Best Director nomination at the Academy Awards but looks to be on his way to his first. A film that should be looked at and appreciated for its beauty and message. Full Review | Original Score: 3.5/4                                  | Feb 18, 2022 Drew Dietsch FANDOM An unadulterated celebration of classical romance, monster movies, and the captivating sorcery of filmmaking. Full Review | Original Score: 5/5                                  | Dec 29, 2021 Milana Vujkov Lola On Film This intoxicating burst of goodness celebrates connection, the space in-between, the silence of it, a quiet reading of heartbeats, the way we dance inside. Full Review | Original Score: 5/5                                  | Jul 29, 2021 Fletcher Powell KMUW - Wichita Public Radio Leave your cynicism at the door-- there's no place for it here. Full Review | Jul 20, 2021 Nick Reilly NME (New Musical Express) Ultimately, del Toro's masterpiece is an utter triumph in finding love and humanity in the most unlikely of places - and it asks us to do exactly the same. Full Review | Original Score: 4/5                                  | Jun 30, 2021 Yasmin Omar Harper's Bazaar Without making a sound, Hawkins delivers a moving, entirely gestural performance that has charmed critics. Full Review | Original Score: 4/5                                  | Jun 25, 2021 Jim Rohner Battleship Pretension Social politics have always provided del Toro's films with both subtext and context but The Shape of Water is the most literal translation of his embracing of the Other as beautiful... Full Review | Apr 14, 2021 Ian Brill Battleship Pretension A romance between two characters who never speak which means Del Toro must depict their love only in visuals. This leads to many beautiful cinematic scenes, including one of the most unique, and but wonderful, sex scenes in recent years. Full Review | Apr 13, 2021 Tori Brazier Flickering Myth ... Worthy of acclaim for its bold imagination, design and straddling of genres, as well as a heavy-weight cast, but it's perhaps more conventional than people might expect. Full Review | Original Score: 4/5                                  | Mar 25, 2021 Alix Turner Ready Steady Cut A what-if story... What if The Creature from the Black Lagoon found love? What if Beauty and the Beast were set in Cold War USA?
