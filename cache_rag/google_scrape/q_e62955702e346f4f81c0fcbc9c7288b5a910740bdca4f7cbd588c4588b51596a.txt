She then heads out on to the clubhouse balcony and holds the Venus Rosewater Dish aloft for the fans. Share Updated at 14.52 EDT 10 Jul 2021 11.32 EDT Barty strolls around the court clutching her trophy (dish) and smiling broadly. That was such a compelling final, in the end, and it was all the more dramatic for the rollercoaster of emotions that it provided. Pliskova put up an incredible fight to win the second set and take it to a decider, but Barty just had too much in the end. Share Updated at 11.33 EDT 10 Jul 2021 11.30 EDT Will Barty have a party? “I think we will, but we’ll keep it pretty low-key. I’m so proud of my whole team and I can’t wait to be with them soon.” And that concludes the post-match interview duty (on court, at least) for Ash Barty - the first Australian women’s singles champion at Wimbledon since Goolagong Cawley in 1980. Well played. Share 10 Jul 2021 11.27 EDT Asked about her friend and mentor Evonne Goolagong Cawley, who won this tournament 50 years ago (and again in 1980), Barty’s voice cracks as she says: “I hope I made Evonne proud.” Share Updated at 14.51 EDT 10 Jul 2021 11.25 EDT Read our snap match report here: Ashleigh Barty battles past Karolina Pliskova to clinch first Wimbledon title Read more Share 10 Jul 2021 11.24 EDT Of her coach, Craig Tyzzer, Barty adds: “He’s a captain, he’s the best at what he does, and I love him to death.” Share 10 Jul 2021 11.19 EDT And now Barty, the new Wimbledon champion: “This is incredible ... I have to start with Kara ... congratulations to you on a fantastic tournament, and to your team ... I love testing myself against you, and I’m sure we’ll play in many, many more matches. I genuinely have to thank every single person in this stadium, you have made my dream so special, so thank you so much.” What did she tell herself at the start of the third? “Just keep fighting ... Kara is an incredible competitor ... I knew I had to bring my best level, I was proud of myself the way I was able to reset, keep chipping away ... and hold my nerve in the end.” Asked to talk us through the match point, she laughs: “I can’t remember it. It took me a long time to dare to dream and to verbalise the fact that I wanted to win this incredible tournament ... it’s better than I ever could have imagined ... I didn’t sleep a lot last night, I was thinking of all the ‘what ifs’, but when I came out on this court today I felt at home, in a way, and I think being able to share that with everyone here and share that with my team is incredible.” Share Updated at 11.23 EDT 10 Jul 2021 11.16 EDT Pliskova speaks: “Thank you to everyone ... I enjoyed every minute to play on this court ... sorry ...” she pauses for a long time as she is overcome with emotion. There is a huge roar of appreciation from the crowd. “I never cry, never ... I want to start with Ash, she played an incredible tournament and an incredible match today, it wasn’t easy to close the second set, I was fighting very hard to make it difficult for her, but I think she played very well, so congrats to her and her team. “I want to thank all my team ... and all the success goes to them, without them I would not be here, and of course to my family as well. No matter what trophy we have, I think we had an incredible three weeks here. Thank you guys.” Share Updated at 11.17 EDT 10 Jul 2021 11.14 EDT Pliskova receives her runners-up prize from the Duchess of Cambridge ... and Barty waves to the crowd as she accepts the Venus Rosewater Dish. Share Updated at 14.49 EDT 10 Jul 2021 11.10 EDT Barty climbs up into the stand, through the crowds, to embrace her partner and her team. “Pat Cash started this,” observes John McEnroe. And now it’s time for the presentations. That was some match, in the end. Pliskova found such a great level, and made it into a captivating contest, but she will rue that nervous start. She combined some astonishing tennis with some errors at key points, and Barty was the deserved winner. Share Updated at 14.49 EDT 10 Jul 2021 11.07 EDT Barty crouches down , holding her head in disbelief, before jogging to the net to embrace Pliskova. The crowd are going crazy - Barty holds her head in her hands, looking overwhelmed. She is Wimbledon champion and she had to work much harder for that, in the end, than it appeared would be the case after the one-sided first set.

She defeats Karolina Pliskova 6-3, 6-7(4), 6-3 Barty volleys brilliantly for 15-0 but then nets on the next point for 15-15. Pliskova sends a forehand wide - it’s 30-15 - but then finds a fantastic return of serve for 30-30. Then Barty nets a volley which would have forced match point, and instead gives her opponent a break point! Pliskova’s return is deep in the corner, but then she goes for the same corner, and misses, back to deuce. Barty hits her seventh ace of the match, for championship point ... Pliskova crushes a second-serve return, Barty keeps the point alive, the Czech nets a backhand - and it’s all over! Barty has done it! Share Updated at 14.48 EDT 10 Jul 2021 11.00 EDT Barty* 6-3, 6-7(4), 5-3 Pliskova (*denotes next server) A crowd-pleasing point to begin, with Barty chasing down a drop shot in at the net, patting back a volley at point-blank range, then recovering to return a lob, which sees Pliskova nevertheless edge ahead at 15-0. The entertaining exchanges continue - at 30-30, Pliskova produces a second top-class drop volley of the game, and then spanks an ace down the middle. Barty will now serve for the title. Share Updated at 14.47 EDT 10 Jul 2021 10.54 EDT Barty 6-3, 6-7(4), 5-2 *Pliskova (*denotes next server) Pliskova continues to veer between the sublime and the significantly less sublime. Barty stays solid - and is probably grateful for another error from her opponent at 30-30 - and she moves to within one game of her first Wimbledon title. There was a stunning winner from Pliskova to force it to 30-30 but Barty’s first serve was reliable when it needed to be. Pliskova will serve to stay in it. Share Updated at 10.56 EDT 10 Jul 2021 10.51 EDT Barty* 6-3, 6-7(4), 4-2 Pliskova (*denotes next server) Pliskova rushes to 40-0. Barty fires back with a superbly-worked point, moving her opponent all around the court and volleying an emphatic winner out wide. But the Czech closes the game out. Pliskova will be wondering: will the nerves start to creep in for Barty as she nears the finish line? Can Pliskova find that crucial break? Share Updated at 14.46 EDT 10 Jul 2021 10.48 EDT Barty has hit 25 winners. Pliskova 21. View image in fullscreen Ashleigh Barty with a forehand. Photograph: Neil Hall/EPA Share Updated at 10.51 EDT 10 Jul 2021 10.47 EDT Barty 6-3, 6-7(4), 4-1 *Pliskova (*denotes next server) Pliskova sends a forehand long, with a chance to move 0-30 ahead. Barty smokes a wonderful forehand winner to the corner to move in front, 30-15, after a point in which she varied pace and direction beautifully. Pliskova then fires straight back with a regal forehand winner down the line to make it 30-30. It’s a high level here. But then a slightly careless-looking error at 30-30 by Pliskova, yet again, as she dumps a shot into the net to hand Barty game point. Pliskova continues to take it on, but sends a double-handed backhand just wide, and Barty edges closer to the prize. Pliskova, who cannot afford to drop serve here, looks calm as she prepares to fight in the next game. Share Updated at 14.45 EDT 10 Jul 2021 10.43 EDT Barty* 6-3, 6-7(4), 3-1 Pliskova (*denotes next server) A tremendous hold from the Czech player, moving Barty around the court and serving with conviction. Pliskova is still very much in this match. Share 10 Jul 2021 10.40 EDT Barty 6-3, 6-7(4), 3-0 *Pliskova (*denotes next server) Barty gets to 40-0. Pliskova plays a couple of excellent points to roar back to 40-30. But then she overhits a forehand, and Barty is firmly, firmly in control of this third and final set after dropping that second set on a tiebreak. It looks like the stuff that champions are made of. Pliskova will serve with new balls. Share Updated at 10.41 EDT 10 Jul 2021 10.36 EDT Barty* 6-3, 6-7(4), 2-0 Pliskova (*denotes next server) A horrible, first-set-style error on a regulation forehand which crashes into the net, and suddenly it’s 0-40 on the Czech’s serve. She wins one point back with a fantastic winner down the line ... but then slumps an easy volley into the net, with the point seemingly won, and hands her opponent a break! She will need to battle just as hard as she did in the second set if she is going to win this. Barty has the momentum back. Share Updated at 10.37 EDT 10 Jul 2021 10.33 EDT Barty 6-3, 6-7(4), 1-0 *Pliskova (*denotes next server) Barty races to 40-0. Pliskova, with an apparent insouciance in everything she does, races back to force deuce. But Barty, having won advantage, finds a brilliant drop shot which Pliskova can’t run down, and edges ahead in this decisive final set. Share Updated at 14.44 EDT 10 Jul 2021 10.27 EDT This is turning into a truly remarkable , memorable final. Pliskova’s error on that backhand volley, when she led in her service game by 40-0, appeared to have handed Barty a crucial edge. But Pliskova, to her eternal credit, broke straight back, and then hit her shots with tonnes of conviction in the tiebreak. Barty will now serve at 1-1 in sets. You could say momentum is with Pliskova - but Barty has been the better player overall. Can she prove it? View image in fullscreen Ashleigh Barty plays a forehand.

Share 10 Jul 2021 10.25 EDT Second set tiebreak: Barty 4-6 Pliskova This is tense! Share Updated at 10.25 EDT 10 Jul 2021 10.24 EDT Second set tiebreak: Barty 2-6 Pliskova Wow! Pliskova wins the point of the match, running down a Barty shot that flicked the net, lobbing, and finishing off with a smash. The crowd goes wild. Share Updated at 14.43 EDT 10 Jul 2021 10.21 EDT Second set tiebreak: Barty 2-4 Pliskova The Czech hits back now with her own service points ... and then grabs a mini-break! Tracey Austin on the BBC correctly mentions that Pliskova is now swinging with plenty of freedom on her groundstrokes. Share Updated at 14.43 EDT 10 Jul 2021 10.20 EDT Pliskova serves big, first up, but Barty fires straight back by winning two points on serve, and the Australian leads 2-1 in the tiebreak. Share 10 Jul 2021 10.18 EDT Second set tiebreak: Barty 6-3, 6-6 Pliskova! A nervous service game from Barty is punished. Can Pliskova take this to three sets? The neutrals among us will be hoping so.

Share 10 Jul 2021 10.16 EDT Just to re-confirm the current score - it’s Barty* 6-3, 6-5 Pliskova (*denotes next server) Barty is serving for her first Wimbledon title. Share Updated at 10.16 EDT 10 Jul 2021 10.15 EDT Barty* 6-3, 6-5 Pliskova (*denotes next server) Pliskova is starting to crush her first serve. She is also starting to deal with the Barty slice, returning balls with interest that she would certainly have flopped into the net during the first set. However, at the end of another high-class rally and with Pliskova seemingly cruising to a comfortable hold, a distinctly casual attempt at an easy enough backhand volley lets Barty back in, and from 40-0, the Australian fires back to deuce. Barty works the backhand slice several times to stay in a marathon rally. Pliskova hits with power from the back of the court, but eventually overhits, and it’s break point Barty. Barty closes out the game - and she will serve for the title. That was massive from the Australian - she punished Pliskova’s error on the volley with ruthless efficiency. Share Updated at 14.33 EDT 10 Jul 2021 10.08 EDT Barty 6-3, 5-5 *Pliskova (*denotes next server) A long rally to begin the game ends when Pliskova hits a double-handed backhand wide, berating herself for missing a chance to put her opponent under plenty of pressure to hold. Barty soon finds a big first serve down the middle for 30-15, Pliskova nets from the back of the court on the next point, and another fine serve from the Australian and it’s a solid hold of serve. Share Updated at 10.09 EDT 10 Jul 2021 10.05 EDT Barty* 6-3, 4-5 Pliskova (*denotes next server) At 0-15, a huge wide serve is somehow returned by the Australian, but Pliskova fires back with a beautiful clean winner from outside the tram lines. Pliskova charges on, serving with her trademark power, and holds serve with no concerns. The players sit down for a drink. Barty will serve to stay in the second set. Share Updated at 10.06 EDT 10 Jul 2021 10.03 EDT Barty 6-3, 4-4 *Pliskova (*denotes next server) Barty hits two huge consecutive forehands out wide. Pliskova challenges both. Both are shown to be fractionally in. Pliskova shakes her head in disbelief. It could have been 0-30, but instead it was 30-0, and Barty closes out the game for parity in the second set. Share 10 Jul 2021 10.00 EDT Barty* 6-3, 3-4 Pliskova (*denotes next server) “She’s a different player now,” McEnroe observes of Pliskova, who aces at 115mph for 40-0. The Czech nets a volley to hand Barty a point, but then rounds off the game effectively, and she edges ahead in this second set. Pliskova’s team, in the stand, are out of their seats. But Barty remains in control of this match on the scoreboard, leading as she does by a set. However, the margins are now considerably finer, with her Czech opponent having found her range. Share Updated at 10.01 EDT 10 Jul 2021 09.55 EDT Barty 6-3, 3-3 *Pliskova (*denotes next server) Pliskova breaks back! At 0-30, Pliskova generates a fantastic clean forehand winner off a wide Barty first serve which whizzes into the corner of the court. Barty nets a forehand in the next rally - and Pliskova has found a way back into this set. That was a stunning shot at 0-30, the best of the match so far.

Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters Share Updated at 10.02 EDT 10 Jul 2021 09.52 EDT Barty* 6-3, 3-2 Pliskova (*denotes next server) A 110mph serve, following a clean ace (her second of the match), seals a service hold for Pliskova. But Barty remains a break up, so the Australian is marching to a wonderful victory as it stands, unless Pliskova can find some way to trouble the Australian’s serve. Both players have made 14 unforced errors at this stage. It certainly doesn’t feel that way. Share Updated at 09.53 EDT 10 Jul 2021 09.48 EDT Barty 6-3, 3-1 *Pliskova (*denotes next server) Barty crushes a serve down the middle for 15-30, then double faults for 30-30, a rare moment of encouragement for the Czech. But Barty soon rounds off another game with an ace, and it looks only a matter of time. A short amount of time. Martina Navratilova, the great Czech champion, is pictured up in the royal box, looking none too pleased with life. Share Updated at 09.50 EDT 10 Jul 2021 09.46 EDT Barty* 6-3, 2-1 Pliskova (*denotes next server) The Pliskova renaissance appears to be over. The errors are back, and she is broken to love again. “She can’t execute anything,” says McEnroe of Pliskova’s struggles. “No one wants to see this, apart from Barty.” Share 10 Jul 2021 09.43 EDT Barty 6-3, 1-1 *Pliskova (*denotes next server) Barty isn’t serving badly, either, and that’s a stunningly easy service hold to love, which started with a well-struck ace out wide, and ended with one down the middle. The Australian looks to be the player with extra gears to call on - if her opponent continues to improve. Share Updated at 09.43 EDT 10 Jul 2021 09.41 EDT Barty* 6-3, 0-1 Pliskova (*denotes next server) Pliskova holds, with Barty mustering a single point in return, and the Czech is beginning to hit her first serve a lot better.
