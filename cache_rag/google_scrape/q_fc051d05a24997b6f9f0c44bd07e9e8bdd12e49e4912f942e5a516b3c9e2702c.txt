Members Online • LukeyTarg2 Why do you think The Power of the Dog lost Best Picture? The Power of the Dog is a very weird Best Picture contender, it was the frontrunner of it's awards season till the most crucial moment, the ending of the awards season really helped push Coda to win. Regarding 1917, another frontrunner that ran out of steam before hitting the goal, we can easily point out to the movie being a blatant Oscarbait war pic with a gimmick (the continuous long shots) as the reason why it failed to materialize a Best Picture win. Now The Power of the Dog IMO falls quite outside the typical Oscar bait movie, it's not a biopic, it's not an exploitation of a traumatic event, it's not about overcoming obstacles or anything like that. So why did it fail? In my opnion it's story didn't connect to the voters like it did with critics, people recognized it's potential while realizing it was overlong and didn't really warrant it's runtime. Campion is a great director, she got so many beautiful shots in the movie, but the aesthetic is one thing, the pacing is another. I don't think the gay angle somehow hurt it, like others have said. Moonlight won the Oscar years prior and it's a lot more explicit on it's gay themes than anything in The Power of the Dog. I do get that there was a boycott campaign on the movie, but it don't think the boycott did anything. I think there was a resistance to award it from the get go given the movie felt longer than it was and it didn't seem justified at all by the script. Read more New to Reddit?
