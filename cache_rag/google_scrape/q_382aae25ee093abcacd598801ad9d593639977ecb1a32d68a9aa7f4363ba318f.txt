Greg 26th May 2021 2560 views 0 Listen to this article The US LEGO Store Calendar for June 2021 has been revealed and we can see what’s on offer throughout the month. There are two things that jump out at me, the first is the additional $10 needed to grab the LEGO Ninjago Brickheadz , after spending $85 in the first place, what’s that about?! The second is the totally out of the blue LEGO Swing Ship GWP , I must say it does look interesting but something I won’t purposely rush out to get. Please keep in mind this is the US version and will/May differ depending what region you’re in. June 1st to 30th LEGO Ninjago 10th Anniversary BrickHeadz (40490) purchase of $85 or more, in-store only. An additional $10 is needed for the offer. June 1st to December 31st Free LEGO VIP Minifigure Keychain (854090). Available to new VIP members only. June 7th to 20th Free LEGO Speed Champions McLaren Elva (30343) Polybag against purchases of $40 or more. June 21st to 30th Free LEGO Swing Ship Ride (5006746) against purchases of $85 or more. VIP exclusive. June 24th to July 11th Free LEGO Bob Minion with Robot Arm (30387) polybag against purchases of $40 or more.
