More Articles 3 Comments Sort by Highest Rated Newest Oldest Highest Rated Lowest Rated HebrewGamer (on 27 March 2025) Xenoblade is a niche franchise. 3 million lifetime would be a huge success. +3 FarleyMcFirefly (on 27 March 2025) Xenoblade X deserves so much more. I hope that WW numbers are comparable to the first game's re-release on Switch. +3 Salnax (on 27 March 2025) 74k for XCX is a touch low for the series; X2 and X3 had FW's of 97k and 112k respectively, and even Xenoblade Definitive Edition had a FW of 90k. As far as Switch ports of last gen games go, this is a bit below Luigi's Mansion 2 (88k) and DKCR (107k). But honestly, selling a bit less week 1 than some well received Mario franchise games is not bad. 0 Popular Stories PS5 Sells Over 1.1M, NS Tops 150M - Worldwide Hardware Estimates for March 2025 PS5 Tops 30M, XS Tops 20M - Americas Hardware Estimates for March 2025 The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Tops 4 Million Players PS5 Leads in Slow Month - Europe Hardware Estimates for March 2025 PS5 Best-Seller in the US in March, Assassin's Creed Shadows Debuts in 1st Analysts Forecast Switch 2 Supply to Hit 6 to 8 Million by Launch 2025 Americas Sales Comparison Charts Through March - PS5 vs Xbox Series X|S vs Switch FBC: Firebreak Launches June 17 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Game Pass, and PS Plus Game Catalog PS5 vs PS4 Sales Comparison in the US - March 2025 Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Was the Best-Selling Game in the US Following PS5 Launch Related Games Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition Role-Playing Latest Charts Methodology Top-Selling Games Articles Forums RSS Facebook Twitter Friends: Vandal OpenCritic Gamewise N4G Essay Pro PapersOwl About Us | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Advertise | Staff | Contact Display As Desktop Display As Mobile © 2006-2025 VGChartz Ltd .
