A cautionary tale of Diablo 3's fall from grace and the repeating history occurring in Diablo 4 - PC General Discussion - Diablo IV Forums Diablo IV Forums A cautionary tale of Diablo 3's fall from grace and the repeating history occurring in Diablo 4 PC General Discussion Atramedes-11822 June 15, 2023,  6:10pm 1 Diablo 3 was one of the most highly anticipated video games upon its release in 2012. However, over time, it faced significant backlash and experienced a fall from grace in the eyes of many players and fans. Several factors contributed to this decline, and I’ll explain them in detail. Auction House Controversy: Diablo 3 introduced an in-game auction house system that allowed players to buy and sell items using real or in-game currency. This system received heavy criticism for various reasons. It affected the game’s economy, as the best items were often only available through the auction house, leading to imbalances and a lack of satisfaction in finding gear through gameplay. Additionally, the real-money auction house was seen as a potential avenue for pay-to-win mechanics, which frustrated players who preferred a more skill-based progression system. Loot System and Itemization: Diablo games are known for their loot-driven gameplay, where finding powerful items is a core part of the experience. However, Diablo 3’s loot system at launch faced widespread criticism. Drop rates for rare and powerful items were low, and the random itemization often led to players receiving items that were not suited for their characters. This resulted in a lack of excitement and satisfaction when acquiring loot, and the endgame item grind became monotonous. Lack of Endgame Content: Diablo 3’s endgame content was seen as lacking depth and longevity. The initial release had limited activities beyond completing the main story and repeating the same few dungeons. This lack of variety and meaningful endgame goals caused many players to lose interest once they finished the campaign. Inferno Difficulty and Balancing Issues: Diablo 3’s highest difficulty level, Inferno, was extremely challenging and unbalanced upon release. Players felt that the difficulty spike was too steep and unfair, which led to frustration and a lack of progression. The game required extensive gear grinding to progress, making it inaccessible and unenjoyable for many players. Communication and Patching Delays: Blizzard’s communication with the player base during Diablo 3’s troubled launch was perceived as inadequate. The company was slow to address and fix the issues players were facing, leading to frustration and a sense of abandonment. Patches and updates to address the game’s problems were delayed, exacerbating player dissatisfaction. Despite Diablo 4’s absence of an auction house, the game still grapples with significant issues that have affected player enjoyment. The presence of unenjoyable legendary items, a broken loot system that impedes progression, and the limitation of build options to linear configurations have led to a severe lack of diversity in character customization. This stifles player creativity and undermines the core essence of the Diablo experience. While the controversial auction house generated much debate, the underlying problem extended beyond its existence. The fallout arose when players invested their hard-earned resources in the auction house, only to have their purchased items subsequently nerfed, leaving them disheartened and disillusioned. The landscape began to change with the release of Reaper of Souls and Blizzard’s shift in approach to Diablo 3. However, prior to these improvements, Jay Wilson, a seasoned developer with a successful track record, unfortunately bore the brunt of criticism and became a subject of mockery. Online, his legacy became synonymous with being the person responsible for “ruining Diablo 3,” an unfair portrayal that tarnished his reputation among anonymous individuals. IN GIST: YOU NERFED CRAP PEOPLE WERE INVESTED INTO. Most people didn’t CARE about RMAH, they just cared that you ruined items after purchase with zero compensation and left players holding the bag. You’re doing the same thing but replace actual financial investment outside of the initial cost with enjoyment and time invested into your game, builds they enjoy, et cetera. In essence, Diablo 3’s journey teaches us valuable lessons about the consequences of flawed systems and the lasting impact they can have on a game’s perception. It underscores the need for developers to prioritize player feedback, address core issues promptly, and communicate effectively to ensure a vibrant and thriving community. With Diablo 4 now past the horizon, it is crucial to learn from the past and deliver an exceptional gaming experience that rekindles the flame of the beloved franchise. Which leads me to ask: Why should players have to discover that their class is bugged through Twitter instead of receiving a clear message on the launcher? It’s unfair that they invest hours of work and money into a seemingly untested game, only to find out they can’t receive loot properly or may obtain unintended items for their class. Why isn’t this addressed through official posts and the launcher? When Jay Wilson stepped down from Diablo 3 and the new director aimed for a “buff not nerf” approach, it seemed like a positive direction. However, despite the loud outcry from players on various public forums, why is content still being gutted? The lack of end-game content and the absence of strong incentives to try different things are reminiscent of Diablo 3’s early stages. If this launch is meant to gather data, why not buff NM dungeons and encourage exploration? What happened to the promising commitment of listening to the community? Why the change? If there are future plans, why not communicate them in advance to help players understand the upcoming changes? While being cautious about revealing too much is understandable, similar to Diablo 3’s early stages, you’re still exhibiting some of the same behaviors. Lack of clear communication on nerfs and adjustments, stealthy nerfing, reluctance to buff Eternal Realm content, and forcing players into unfulfilling builds with excessive defensive requirements. None of these changes inspire players to stick around. Diablo 4 may be breaking records, but how many players will you lose before deciding to be more transparent? It’s crucial to foster trust and provide open communication with the player community for the game to thrive. There are people still talking about Error 32. There are still people taking Jay Wilson’s name as a meme. C’mon, dawg. Address all this stuff already. I am one of the few people that enjoyed D3 prior to the changes in RoS and I can see you attempting to recreate originality but despite us having SO MANY cool skills, we’re unable to utilize them all because once again your end-game and over-buffed, completely rectal penetrating cactus affixes ensure that EVERY player must run defenses in obsess from 70+. And while streamers can argue this nonsense about “Well, you have gold excess at higher levels,” that isn’t how most casuals are seeing it. It’s freaking expensive and depressing for a lot of players to reroll. I’ve had to keep my friend from quitting druid by helping him regear and power level another character. That’s not how it should be. Your obnoxious cost for things early on is hurting people from trying new things. And not some of us vets but people who have never played Diablo. People who are curious. People who like the idea of season pass and payments. Fix that crap. Less control of our characters is bad, Blizzard. From – A rogue that’s cleared NM 94. Make no mistake. I love the game but these are the biggest issues I am seeing that keep coming back to bite you guys in the rear. It’s always “we’re listening, we hear you.” You gonna lose more people again if this keeps up. You ain’t killing me. I’m a sweaty player. You’re murdering casuals. Edit: Inferno was a bit funny. You were either one of two players; you got in early and farmed chests that were nerfed to all heck, killed Diablo on Inferno with insane attack speed and farmed blue/yellows with obnoxious attack speed. Or you were a player who arrived later when all the nerfs took place and were receiving garbage items, since all farms were effectively nerfed. 13 Likes Zizin-21506 June 15, 2023,  7:53pm 2 D3 itemization was good on start, much better than casualized ROS one. Just balance with drop rate was bad. StRaItJaCkEt-1704 June 15, 2023,  7:55pm 3 Zizin: D3 itemization was good on start, No, it wasn’t. Just like D4 it was heavily dependent on damage scaling from your weapon and crit damage. It’s almost identical to terrible D3 system. 4 Likes Zizin-21506 June 15, 2023,  7:58pm 4 Well, at least affixes were meaningful and desireable. Every item felt different. Some were plain trash, some were mid, some were good, some were great and some were perfect. And btw it wasn’t easy at all to get crits, unlike ROS. Item hunt was there. It doesn’t exist in D4. vanadiel-1596 June 15, 2023,  7:58pm 5 I loved that auction house. Made $7 selling a few wizard hats that were just regular drops. HaVeRCoOcH-1185 June 15, 2023,  8:11pm 6 d2 was so far ahead of its time. The itemization is infinitely superior to the d3/d4 itemization. You had so many more options in d2… Like the fact that people cant play a sword/shield barb is so stupid. Necro is the only shield class in the entire game… WHY! Why doesn’t every class has a block mechanic… Instead I have 14 different types of damage reductions? Damage reduction from close/far/overall… Its just a mess. No idea why we don’t have any auras in the game. The items feel very boring, they don’t add versatility to any characters, they simply allow you push one higher greater rift. 6 Likes Tuggma-1479 June 15, 2023,  8:17pm 7 time is a flat circle bud we might see something come close to d1/d2 around diablo 19 or 20 maybe 10 if we’re lucky, we’ll just have to see how the pattern goes 9 year average dev time so were looking at minimum 2077 (lol) 1 Like Atramedes-11822 June 16, 2023, 12:56pm 8 D3 itemization was fairly brutal but their introduction to the game and including the progression up until you needed it to be meaningful was harsh. By the time D3 had come out it’d been well over a decade since D2. How much has changed in that time? Longer version: Did people really want a super difficult, in depth ARPG? POE is popular but it doesn’t hold a candle to a Blizzard title and despite all these other ARPG’s coming out, they all still fall short to Diablo. Including Diablo 3. Our gripes are internal. This failure is not as astronomical as World of Warcraft’s exodus to FFXIV. No where near it. There’s a saying when it comes to the arts which is evolution is necessary in order for us to keep up with the times and at times we must force evolution forward by attempting new things. When I think of how to incorporate evolution with proper support I think of Nintendo. The Wii was critically received, still sold amazingly. The Wii U flopped but instead of giving up entirely on all the aspects of these both units combined, they managed to create the top selling system of the generation. Applying this logic to Diablo 4 – D3 became an arcade looter game. There was no difficulty increase other than min/maxing gear for density pushing. This is the crux of the players that have come to D4 from D3. They outnumber the outliers which are okay with the traditional sweat, blood and tears grinding are minimal and almost non-existing. Since the early development of D3 they have have continued to linearize the operation of Character Control in Diablo. D4 – if you want to be successful in NM’s as a Rogue then you must run two forms of CC breakers. Commonly you get 5 seconds from Shadow Clone and you get an easy out with Shadow Step. You remove the fast paced gaming by utilizing Dash early and it becomes a hallow class meant to deal damage with more buttons that another class can do with far less stress (Barbarian, Necromance, Druid et cetera.) You are being told where and how to play your class and what flavor of damage you’d like in tiers based on the way the external world interacts with your character. While you’ll always have the illusion of choice, every successful build follows this formula. CHC/CHD/VULN/Damage Reduction/Core Skill Damage/Level 21 glyphs. Fill the rest out with meta and create your character. Dreadius-1599 June 16, 2023,  1:14pm 9 The correct way to grind gear in D3 if you couldn’t get a boost into Act 3 was to smash pots on the Road to Alcarnus and kill Treasure Goblins and reset the game lobby over and over grinding the same area over and over and avoiding any forms of combat. In what possible way has Diablo 4 repeated that history? In D3, fighting mobs was the worst way to get loot. That’s why D3’s launch was so awful. If you got bored of breaking pots, the other best way to get loot was to swipe your credit card. D4 has no trading so you are incentivized to play the game yourself and get loot yourself - the core of how this type of game should work (rewards are earned by playing the game, not via trading sites). I feel like some of you guys live in a bizarre alternate universe when you suggest D4’s laucnh was as bad as D3’s, lol. Atramedes: Most people didn’t CARE about RMAH, they just cared that you ruined items after purchase with zero compensation and left players holding the bag No, they really did, because Blizzard nerfed drop rates to make RMAH appealing and that meant they were smashing goblin pots for longer. Once the RMAH was gone, loot drop-rates went way up in ROS. PoE has a similar problem that drop rates are insanely low and you’re expected to trade for your build arounds, whereas less than a month after launch I’ve got my build arounds on my Sorc. 1 Like Dreadius-1599 June 16, 2023,  1:15pm 10 Atramedes: Level 21 glyphs. I agree that the overreliance on Crit/Crit dam / vul / CDR is way too much, but this statement? Lol. Yeah of course everyone wants Level 21 glyphs. That’s like saying “All classes are the same, they get more powerful as they progress towards level 100”. That’s the point. Atramedes-11822 June 16, 2023,  1:17pm 11 Dreadius: No, they really did, because Blizzard nerfed drop rates to make RMAH appealing and that meant they were smashing goblin pots for longer.

PoE has a similar problem that drop rates are insanely low and you’re expected to trade for your build arounds, whereas less than a month after launch I’ve got my build arounds on my Sorc. Accurate. However, in practice it was receive well until the skepticism was founded. What you and I are saying is the same thing. Nerfed rates for double dipping in auction house Forcing a credible payment option to ensure they were making money. ROS loot rate went up because of their new approach, this was not only directly related to the removal of the AH but also to prevent the lawsuit they’d get slapped with for advertising falsly. The real reason the RMAH failed was because they nerfed gear after players purchased. Players asked for compensation and Blizzard said no. You can view the statistics on reputable websites in which a huge migration occurred of losing well over 70% of the player base because of this spreading like wild fire. Sonez-1486 June 16, 2023,  1:20pm 12 Nice post. Personally I don’t want the game to be anything like diablo 3, nor do I want it to be like PoE, I really hope the developers can find a nice middle ground. It doesn’t have to be perfect, but enough to keep us coming back for 1-2 months each season would be great. I think we all know we aren’t getting anything truly innovative to the genre at this point. 1 Like Atramedes-11822 June 16, 2023,  1:21pm 13 What is wrong with this statement? You’re approaching this from a perspective of people knowing. Spend a day or three inside of the official Sanctuary discord and you’d have answered 99% of peoples problems with “You should level your Glyph’s.” What that tells me is what you’re completely looking over; the average player doesn’t understand this one bit. Furthermore, despite being level 100 paragon, this isn’t sufficed to be “more powerful,” in the sense that you’re stronger than someone who isn’t level 100 but also understanding the implication of glyphs and their contribution to the board and as well the board is all done in unison. Again, you’re an experienced players and for you this is common sense but perhaps be more flexible in thought and realize other players who are far more casual don’t see this. And despite being a sweaty player myself, I can tell you for a fact that casuals make games. They fund games. Far more than every sweat in D4 put together, casual players are the majority not you or I. Edit: One of my reviews I stated the top three things I’d tell any new player or active player to D4 is the following: 1 ) Read your skills and the ability nodes on the Paragon Board to understand multiplicative and additive damage. 2 ) Level your glyphs to 21 and understand which glyphs benefit which boards in correlation with your build, 3 ) Understand the synergy between the two above and combine them to form a workable build. All you’re doing is nitpicking a small statement for a moot point which doesn’t devalue information newer players and casual players need to be successful. Otherwise, they can consult a guide and gripe about being stuck in NM 80 and lower. Abomb247-1301 June 16, 2023,  2:14pm 14 Only good thing about D3 was the RMAH.  D3 was a bad game but at least you could drink some coffee find some items and sell them for cash to make it worth your time.  Once they removed that and started with BoA.  Game really died. 2 Likes DexterousGek-1324 June 16, 2023,  2:18pm 15 Josh Mosqueira at GDC 2015 talking about Diablo 3 and their struggles. Great watch, and especially interesting when looking at it through the Diablo 4 lens. It’s a bit of a watch (just over an hour) but it’s so interesting. 1 Like Atramedes-11822 June 16, 2023,  2:33pm 16 The game didn’t die because they removed RMAH. Jay Wilson put out statistics which showed that not a single player clearing inferno had not used the RMAH at least once. It died because they nerfed equipment that people paid cash for out of the RMAH. Abomb247-1301 June 16, 2023,  2:37pm 17 Atramedes: The game didn’t die because they removed RMAH. No it didn’t.  You misunderstood me.  D3 was a bad game.  The RMAH and trading kept players there.  They removed the RMAH and introduced BoA so many Diablo fans like myself left.  I quit the day trading and RMAH left.  No reason to keep playing a bad game if there wasn’t any excitement in finding items or couldn’t give them to friends. Diablo is a trading loot hunting game.  That’s why D2 had such a long life coupled with replayability and PvP which helps keep the PvE economy alive. If D4 is going to be successful they need great improvements for the social aspect, economy, trading and PvP.  They have chase items in D4 (very cool) but you can’t even trade for them.  So what’s the point.  I find a cool legendary I can’t even give it to my friends?  Bad design. D4 will repeat D3 unfortunately.  At least we have D2R and PoE2 coming out. PS - I’ve had fun in D4 but can’t see myself playing past another month.  It doesn’t have the infrastructure to hold player for a decade like D2.  Or even past 2-3 months. 1 Like MeatLord-1477 June 16, 2023,  3:09pm 18 I appreciate this post. D4 will get “there” just like D3 did.  It will take some time and many many adjustments and tweaks.  For me D3 evolved into something that was very enjoyable and appealed to my desire to craft powerful builds with an array of synergistic items and an environment  in which to test them that remained relevant and challenging (and rewarding).  I am sure that D4 will evolve into the same.  The foundation is there (a foundation that was NOT present in D3) and so my hope is that they can accomplish this in less time than D3.  Anyway, there are aspects of D4 that I enjoy and some that I find supremely frustrating.  I am going to give it time. Dreadius-1599 June 16, 2023,  3:20pm 19 Abomb247: The RMAH and trading kept players there. Not sure I can post enough laugh emojis. D3 had better reception on console than PC and never had trading. 2 Likes Abomb247-1301 June 16, 2023,  3:25pm 20 MeatLord: D4 will get “there” just like D3 did. D3 died nearly a decade ago.  D3 was a massive failure and almost the entirety of the player base left many years ago for better games.  More players play D2 then D3 today. D3 is a 2/10 game.  There hasn’t been a reason to play D3 in almost a decade.  How can you say “GET THERE”  D3 never got there.  It had no life span. Almost no one has played D3 since 2014.  That’s a long time ago D3 is ancient dead history. More copies of D4 would of sold but players are worried it will end up like D3 so are hesitant to play.  D3 sold a lot of copies at first cause of the name and anticipation but it wasn’t a Sequel too D2 like we wanted. next page → Home Categories Guidelines Terms of Service Privacy Policy Powered by Discourse , best viewed with JavaScript enabled
