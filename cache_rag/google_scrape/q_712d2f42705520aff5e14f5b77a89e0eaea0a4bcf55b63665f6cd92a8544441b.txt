Electoral College See also: Electoral College in the 2020 presidential election The Electoral College is the process by which the states and District of Columbia elect the president of the United States . Each state is represented by a number of electors equal to the size of its congressional delegation. There are 538 electors in total. To win the Electoral College, a candidate must receive a majority—at least 270—electoral votes. [7] The Electoral College met on December 14, 2020, to cast their votes for president and vice president of the United States. The final tally was 306 electoral votes for former Vice President Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D) and 232 electoral votes for President Donald Trump (R) and Vice President Mike Pence (R). [8] Although there is no constitutional provision or federal law requiring electors to vote in accordance with the election results in their state, electors typically vote for their state's popular vote winner. Some states have provisions permitting the disqualification and replacement of an elector whose vote deviates from the state's popular vote.  There were no faithless electors in 2020.

Democratic National Convention, 2020 The Democratic National Committee (DNC) held its presidential nominating convention the week of August 17, 2020, across four stages in New York City , Los Angeles , Milwaukee , and Wilmington . [11] [12] The convention was originally scheduled to take place July 13-16, 2020, in Milwaukee. [13] Organizers postponed the event in response to the coronavirus pandemic . Most of the convention's events took place remotely. The DNC announced in June 2020 that delegates should not plan to travel to Milwaukee to attend the convention. [14] Instead, votes on reports from the Rules, Platform , and Credentials committees took place remotely from August 3-15, 2020. [15] The Democratic National Convention Committee announced on August 5, 2020, that former Vice President Joe Biden (D) and other speakers would not travel to Milwaukee. [16] Biden was formally nominated at the convention on August 18, 2020. [17] Biden announced U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris (D) as his running mate on August 11, 2020. [18] Harris was the first Black woman to appear on a major party's ticket in the United States. [19] 2020 Republican National Convention See also: Republican National Convention, 2020 The Republican Party held its national convention from August 24-27, 2020. [20] Limited in-person events took place in Charlotte, North Carolina . [21] On July 23, 2020, President Donald Trump announced that high-profile convention events previously moved to Jacksonville, Florida , including his nomination acceptance speech, had been canceled for public health and safety reasons. Trump formally accepted the party's nomination from the White House. [22] [23] [24] [25] The convention was originally scheduled to take place entirely in Charlotte but statewide restrictions in response to the coronavirus pandemic led to the convention's planned relocation to Jacksonville. [26] The Republican National Committee Executive Committee voted to downsize the convention in Charlotte, reducing the number of in-person delegates from 2,500 to 336. The committee also decided to adopt the 2016 platform again since the Platform Committee would not be meeting. [27] At the convention, party delegates typically select the Republican presidential nominee and vote to adopt a platform outlining the party's policy priorities and values. According to presidential historian Tevi Troy, however, "conventions today remain largely party advertising opportunities rather than fora for real decision-making." [28] Democratic primary debates See also: Democratic presidential primary debates, 2020 The following table provides an overview of the date, location, host, and number of participants in each scheduled 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate. 2020 Democratic presidential primary debates Debate Date Location Host Number of participants First Democratic primary debate June 26-27, 2019 Miami, Florida NBC News , MSNBC , and Telemundo 20 candidates Second Democratic primary debate July 30-31, 2019 Detroit, Michigan CNN 20 candidates Third Democratic primary debate September 12, 2019 Houston, Texas ABC News and Univision 10 candidates Fourth Democratic primary debate October 15, 2019 Westerville, Ohio CNN and The New York Times 12 candidates Fifth Democratic primary debate November 20, 2019 Georgia MSNBC and The Washington Post 10 candidates Sixth Democratic primary debate December 19, 2019 Los Angeles, California PBS NewsHour and Politico 7 candidates Seventh Democratic primary debate January 14, 2020 Des Moines, Iowa CNN and The Des Moines Register 6 candidates Eighth Democratic primary debate February 7, 2020 Manchester, New Hampshire ABC, WMUR-TV, and Apple News 7 candidates Ninth Democratic primary debate February 19, 2020 Las Vegas, Nevada NBC News and MSNBC 6 candidates Tenth Democratic primary debate February 25, 2020 Charleston, South Carolina CBS News and Congressional Black Caucus Institute 7 candidates Eleventh Democratic primary debate March 15, 2020 Washington, D.C.

Presidential election key staff See also: Presidential election key staffers, 2020 Campaign staff plays an important role in the presidential primaries. The makeup of a candidate's staff can signal the strength of their support from influential party activists and whether they are aligning with a particular faction or group within the party. Eric Appleman of Democracy in Action describes candidates' efforts to hire staffers as a "race for talent, both nationally and in key early states." He adds, "The goal is to assemble a team of top talent that can work together effectively to mobilize resources, boost the candidate and his or her message, and ultimately secure the party's nomination." [29] Presidential candidates will typically have a national staff, which is overseen by a campaign manager and assisted by political consultants, senior advisors, professional polling firms, and key stakeholders such as interest group leaders and major financial supporters. They also build organizations in individual states that are overseen by state directors and staffed by party activists and political professionals well-versed in the particular politics of the area. Candidates often appoint elected officials and other important figures in their party's coalition as chairs of their national campaign and state-level campaigns.

PredictIt is an online political futures market in which users purchase shares relating to the outcome of political events using real money. Each event, such as an election, has a number of contracts associated with it, each correlating to a different outcome. For instance, an election contested between four candidates would be represented by eight separate contracts, with each contract correlating to a particular candidate winning or losing the election. The price of a share in each individual contract rises and falls based on market demand. Once the event's outcome is decided, holders of shares that correlate with the correct outcome receive a $1 payout for each share they held. For example, a user buys 10 shares at 20 cents each in a presidential primary saying Candidate A will win. If Candidate A wins the election, the user earns $10. If the candidate loses, the user earns no money and loses his original $2 investment. Why do PredictIt markets matter? Services such as PredictIt are being used to gain insight into the likely outcome of elections. Microsoft Research economist David Rothschild argues that they are better suited to the task than polls: "I can create a poll that can mimic everything about a prediction market...except markets have a way of incentivizing you to come back at 2 a.m. and update your answer."
