Members Online ‚Ä¢ LoFiTae If Christopher Nolan were to make a Marvel movie, who would you want it to be about? Discussion Just to be clear, i don‚Äôt mean as if to say he‚Äôs doing it right now, this second, trying to fit the movie into the timeline of the MCU. You could do that, but i just mean more in general. It could be at any past point of the MCU, be its own separate thing like the Fox movies or the SonyVerse, or whatever. Don‚Äôt limit yourself if you don‚Äôt want to üëçüèæ For an MCU movie, and this is assuming he has full control of the creative process, basically not doing the MCU formula, I think he‚Äôd make an awesome Hawkeye movie for when he was Ronin. His Batman movies and Tenet inspired this idea. I‚Äôd love to see that character be really brought to life on the big screen, and to explore Clint himself during that period. I think Nolan would do a good job with balancing the emotional side of the story, and would make the action almost larger than life to give the movie that ‚Äúepic tale‚Äù feeling. Maybe it could be a show or whatever, i just want him to do it someway. For a standalone movie, in general i would like him to do Nova movie. Specifically Sam Alexander looking for his dad. This idea was inspired by Interstellar. I feel he would do really well with a story of a hero traveling through space, and would do amazing work with the settings. I think the planets visited and space itself would be sights to behold. But what about you guys? Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
