The series begins with an inside look at the early reign of the queen, who ascended the throne at age 25 after the death of her father, King George VI. As the decades pass, personal intrigues, romances, and political rivalries are revealed that played a big role in events that shaped the later years of the 20th century.

The Crown ‚Äî Season 4 What to Know Critics Consensus Whatever historical liberties The Crown takes in its fourth season are easily forgiven thanks to the sheer power of its performances - particularly Gillian Anderson's imposing take on The Iron Lady and newcomer Emma Corrin's embodiment of a young Princess Diana. Read Critics Reviews Critics Reviews View All (113) Critics Reviews Sohel Sarkar Bitch Media The Crown has firmly placed itself as yet another vehicle of Britain's colonial amnesia, blissfully neglectful of the collective traumas of postcolonial nations. Mar 17, 2021 Full Review Will Gompertz BBC.com It is never gripping but it is always entertaining: a much-needed dollop of well-made, well-written, slowly-paced telly. Rated: 4/5 Dec 22, 2020 Full Review Neal Justin Minneapolis Star Tribune It's telling that the most sympathetic newcomer this season is Michael Fagan, the Brit who sneaked into the palace in 1982 and confronted the queen in her bedroom. Dec 22, 2020 Full Review Joonatan Itkonen Toisto.net THE CROWN has always gone for the juicier melodrama over historical fact, and season 4 is more than willing to ignore reality if there‚Äôs a more scandalous option on the table. Rated: 3/5 Jul 8, 2024 Full Review Swara Salih But Why Tho? A Geek Community The Crown Season 4 is a superb season of historical drama. The acting, direction, writing, costuming, cinematography...comes together to present a richly compelling story that will capture your attention, no matter what you think about the Royal Family. Rated: 9.5/10 Jan 22, 2023 Full Review Bill Brioux Brioux.tv The brisk storytelling is there first and foremost to keep audiences glued and entertained.

BUT again Josh O‚ÄôConnor is excellent as is the actress who portrays Princess Di, Rated 5/5 Stars ‚Ä¢ Rated 5 out of 5 stars 01/31/25 Full Review Savannah G Gillian Anderson! really brought all of this season home for me! Again a great cast! as well as thoughtful, creative titles for episodes bringing tragedy and thoughtful consideration to the lives of these people. Rated 4.5/5 Stars ‚Ä¢ Rated 4.5 out of 5 stars 01/08/24 Full Review Sal D Brilliant performance from Olivia Coleman continues the series momentum forward. Rated 4/5 Stars ‚Ä¢ Rated 4 out of 5 stars 12/17/23 Full Review Rhianna J I don't think the casting gets any better than Claire Foy as Queen and Vanessa Kirby as Princess Margaret, their performances are unforgettable. Gillian Anderson, Tobias Menzies & Josh O'Connor were definitely the icing on the cake in Seasons 3/4. I also can't help but wonder why they didn't put blue contact lenses on Olivia Colman. No where near as powerful sadly but still continues to be an excellent watch. Rated 4/5 Stars ‚Ä¢ Rated 4 out of 5 stars 12/13/23 Full Review Michael Antony A Mikey's TV Review: The Crown (2016-) Season 4 of Netflix' 'The Crown' is certainly pushing the boundaries of believability.  Don't get me wrong, it's just as lavish and addictive as previous seasons, but this time the soap opera elements take centre stage, while real events are brushed aside or simply swept under the carpet.There may even be some truth to the suggestion that, the face of Britain during the '80's was changed to the world forever by 3 women. Namely, The People's Princess, Lilibet and The Iron Lady! Olivia Colman once again excels as Elizabeth R., while Helena Bonham-Carter relishes her scenes in a somewhat reduced role as Princess Margaret. Newcomer Emma Corrin is thoroughly engaging as Princess Diana, and Gillian Anderson turns in an Emmy / BAFTA winning performance as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Not to underestimate the brilliant work of Josh O'Connor (Prince Charles), Emerald Fennell (Camilla Parker Bowles) or Tobias Menzies (Prince Philip). But, if you can overlook the (in)accuracies both  personal and historical, you'd be hard pressed to find a better, continuously enjoyable series currently streaming.  Mikey's TV Rating: 4/5* üòäüëç Rated 4/5 Stars ‚Ä¢ Rated 4 out of 5 stars 10/27/23 Full Review Lucresia S Prestige television at its finest form. It's rare to find all cinematic elements that are all perfectly excelled. Even seasons of The Crown are the juiciest and best.
