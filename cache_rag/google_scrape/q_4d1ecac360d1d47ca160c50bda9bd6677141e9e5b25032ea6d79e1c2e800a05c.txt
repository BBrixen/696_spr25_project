Do you know the perfect cast for the movie version of your favourite book?   Welcome to Fan Casting, where the fans are in charge.  Please be mindful that we each have reasons for casting the people we do, and if you disagree with another casting then do so in a respectful way. Members Online • no_step_snek76 Who would you cast in a hypothetical Christopher Nolan directed Avengers movie? Marvel / MCU In a hypothetical alternate world where Christopher Nolan directed the Avengers instead of directing the Dark Knight, who would be the primary cast? A couple caveats. In this hypothetical, there is no Dark Knight trilogy, so don't worry about recasts. I am also thinking Nolan would keep a similar tone as he does with Batman IRL-- Serious, but still action~y and not just a joyless suckfest. I personally only have 2 choices in mind right now. Christian Bale would take the lead as Captain America. Either Mark Ruffalo or Ed Norton could still be Bruce Banner. They both have the acting chops to do more serious films, and I think they may have both worked with Christopher Nolan already. Edit: Tom Hardy as Thor also makes sense to me in this hypothetical.
