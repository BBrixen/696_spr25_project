Fletcher came on board to direct in December after Fox fired Singer from the project after repeated absences from the set had forced the studio to halt production . Fox is opening the movie on Nov. 2. The studio confirmed a report about the directing credit Tuesday in Empire Magazine. “Bryan Singer is the credited director of the film,” producer Graham King said. “Basically, Bryan had some personal issues going on. He wanted to hiatus the movie to deal with them, and the movie had to get finished. That was what it came down to… It wasn’t about reinventing the wheel. We needed someone who would have some creative freedom, but work inside a box.” Related Stories VIP+ What Warner Bros.
