The centre of attention was very much focused on the much-anticipated iPhone 11, with the reveal of three new iPhone models. Expecting the event to mainly focus on the new lineup of iPhones, Apple also took the opportunity to introduce the Apple Watch Series 5 and entry-level iPad, which is compatible with a full-sized Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil. The tech-giant also gave more details on its upcoming gaming subscription service and AppleTV+. Missed the event? Carry on reading for our roundup of everything that was announced at Apple’s ‘By Innovation Only’ keynote. iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max on stage at Apple’s Event 2019 | Photo: Business Insider The heavily-rumoured new iPhone lineup is finally here and with it came a bunch of new upgrades. Announcing three new iPhones models; the iPhone 11 , iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max , Apple promised faster performance, show-stopping camera arrangements and fresh software upgrades. During the event, Apple officially unveiled the ‘cheaper’ iPhone 11 as the follow up to the iPhone XR.  With a 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display, the aluminium-framed iPhone 11 is available in six colours including; purple, green, yellow, white, black and red. Aside from a fresh colour palette, the biggest change of all is the addition of another camera lens. The dual-sensor camera arrangement on the rear of the device has a 12-megapixel wide camera lens, paired with a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera lens with a 120-degree view. The iPhone 11 Pro and it’s a larger sibling, the Pro Max, both have Super Retina XDR displays measuring at 5.8-inches and 6.5-inches, and are both framed by a new matte stainless steel design. The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max step it up a gear by featuring a triple-camera arrangement, inclusive of a 12-megapixel wide camera, 12-megapixel telephoto and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera. All three iPhones also include a Night mode feature allowing you to shoot in low-light conditions, 4K video recording at 60fps, and a 12-megapixel front-facing TrueDepth selfie camera. The selfie camera can also record 4K video and take slow-motion selfies – called ‘Slofies’. In regards to battery and performance, the iPhone 11 range packs a powerful punch. The devices carry larger batteries than its predecessors, with the company stating that the battery lasts up to 1 hour longer on the iPhone 11, up to 4 hours on the iPhone 11 Pro, and up to 5 hours more on the Pro Max. The 11 lineup runs on the A13 Bionic chipset, which Apple is claiming as the fastest mobile processor available today, and will operate the new iOS 13 straight out of the box – which includes the much-anticipated Dark Mode feature, a swipe keyboard and faster performance. It has been confirmed that the iPhone 11 range will be available for pre-order on Friday 13th September and released on Friday 20th September. For the iPhone 11, prices start at £729 for 64GB of storage and are available in capacities of 64GB, 128GB and 256GB. Unsurprisingly, the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max are priced at higher price points of £1,049 and £1,149, respectively, for 64GB. They are available in 64GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage options. Apple Watch Series 5 Apple Watch Series 5 | Photo: Evening Standard During the company’s annual Keynote, the Apple Watch Series 5 was announced. When compared to the Apple Watch Series 4, there has been a lack of major advancements. However, one big change that has been made, is that that display on the Apple Watch 5 doesn’t switch off. The always-on display feature allows you to look down at your watch and see what’s on the screen. Apple has said that the new feature still allows the Watch 5 to have the same 18-hour battery life as previous models by being able to drop as low as 1Hz refresh to save power. The Watch also comes with a compass, optimised faces, and international emergency calling, allowing you to easily call for help when you are away from home. Combined with the power of watch OS 6, Series 5 can monitor your heart rate, track your menstrual cycle and even watch out for your hearing. The Series 5 sports a variety of new bands and faces, whilst being made from 100% recycled aluminium. Orders for the device have already opened on Apple’s website and will go on sale on Friday, September 20th. Prices start from £399 for the GPS model and £499 for the cellular version. iPad 2019 Apple iPad on stage at Apple’s Event 2019 | Photo: Digital Trends Alongside the iPhone 11 range at this year’s launch event, Apple has confirmed the launch of a new 10.2-inch seventh-generation iPad. Replacing the company’s sixth-generation iPad, the device has been optimised for the new iPad OS. iPadOS was announced during WWDC 2019 and now recognises the iPad as its own platform. The operating system encompasses a range of improvements for tablet users, by making better use of the screen and including new gesture controls. The grid app icons on the home screen are much tighter, allowing more to be fitted on the screen. Additionally, the new system lets users utilise split-screen mode to view two app windows at one time, whilst Slide Over lets you swiftly pull over an app over another window. Perhaps the best bit is that iPadOS now supports the plug-in of a USB drive or memory card reader. The new iPad from Apple houses a more powerful A10 processor and just like the Apple Watch Series 5, is made from 100% recycled aluminium. Designed to be the cheapest iPad that customers will purchase at £349, the new iPad is compatible with a full-sized Smart Keyboard and first-generation Apple Pencil. The option to add these new features position the Apple tablet closer to that of a laptop. The device is available to order now and will be shipped on Monday 30th September. Apple Arcade and Apple TV Plus Apple Arcade on stage at Apple’s Event 2019 | Photo: Digital Trends Last but not least, is the introduction of Apple Arcade and Apple TV Plus updates. During the event, Apple showcased See , a new TV series starring Jason Momoa that will be available on Apple TV+. The first AppleTV+ shows will be available on November 1st to over 100 countries.

The video game service will allow users to access more than 100 new games at just £4.99 a month.
