[ 12 ] On Rotten Tomatoes , 10% of 21 critics have given the ceremony a positive review, with an average rating of 3.52/10. The critics consensus on the website reads: "Disappointingly dull and disturbingly lacking in self-awareness, The 78th Golden Globes ceremony wastes its menagerie of celebrities—and some well-deserved wins—on a stilted ceremony overshadowed by HFPA's questionable behind-the-scenes behavior." [ 13 ] Controversies The ceremony received criticism regarding certain nominations. James Corden 's nomination for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (for his performance in The Prom ) and the two nominations for Emily in Paris have faced controversy. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] The HFPA also drew criticism for the placement of Minari in the Best Foreign Language Film category, despite being an American film about a Korean-American family; it ultimately won. [ 16 ] The determination that the film would be eligible for this category rather than Best Motion Picture – Drama , based on the Globes' rule that any film with over 50% of its dialogue not in English would be considered a Foreign Language Film, invited controversy. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Lulu Wang , whose film The Farewell was subject to the same rule the previous year , wrote that "I have not seen a more American film than #Minari this year. It's a story about an immigrant family, IN America, pursuing the American dream. We really need to change these antiquated rules that characterize American as only English-speaking". [ 17 ] Author Viet Thanh Nguyen wrote that the "decision speaks powerfully to the issue of what makes something — a language or a person or a culture — foreign". [ 21 ] Many other filmmakers, actors, and authors, including Nia DaCosta , Daniel Dae Kim , Min Jin Lee , Franklin Leonard , Simu Liu , Phil Lord , Celeste Ng , Harry Shum Jr. , and Phillipa Soo criticized the decision on similar grounds. [ 22 ] The nominations for the film Music also faced criticism for the casting of Maddie Ziegler as an autistic person, and concerns over what impact the film could have on the perception and handling of autistic people, [ 23 ] with co-host Tina Fey joking that " Twitter is saying it's the most offensive casting since Kate Hudson was the Weightwatchers spokesperson". [ 24 ] Hosts Fey and Amy Poehler also acknowledged the recent revelation that the HFPA has not had a single Black member for over twenty years. [ 24 ] Viewership The ceremony received 6.9 million viewers in the United States, with a 1.5 Nielsen rating among adults 18 to 49, representing a 68% drop in viewership from the previous year's ceremony . It is the least viewed Golden Globe Awards telecast since the 65th Golden Globe Awards in 2008, which was solely a press conference due to the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike .
