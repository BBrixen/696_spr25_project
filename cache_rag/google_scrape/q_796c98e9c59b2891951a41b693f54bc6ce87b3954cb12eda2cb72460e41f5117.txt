[Full review in spanish] Full Review | Apr 23, 2025 Erick Estrada Cinegarage The descent of Michael to different hells. Each one more tragic. Each one more profound. [Full review in Spanish] Full Review | Nov 1, 2022 Nick Hasted The Arts Desk For all its flashy flaws, perhaps we should be grateful Coppola scrabbled so close to a legitimate last act. Full Review | Original Score: 4/5                                  | Mar 14, 2022 Bill Chambers Film Freak Central I'm reminded of Robert Evans objecting to a shortened version of The Godfather that removed all its texture. "Where's the sauce, Francis?" he asked. Full Review | Original Score: 1.5/4                                  | Mar 3, 2022 Victoria Luxford City AM Coppola explores some interesting ideas, even if they dont all work out... but aside from a notable change in the final shot, there will be little to win over the haters. Full Review | Original Score: 3/5                                  | Feb 28, 2022 David Gonzalez The Cinematic Reel Still, as Michael is well aware, Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. Thats what Francis Ford Coppola has accomplished with The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, hes pulled us all back in. Full Review | Original Score: 3.5/4                                  | Feb 18, 2022 Peter Canavese Celluloid Dreams An American tragedy writ large. This "CODA" is ultimately the same movie as "The Godfather, Part III", albeit re-positioned, but still a good, quite worthy movie. (Blu-ray Director's Cut Review). Full Review | Original Score: 3/4                                  | Jan 26, 2022 Zaki Hasan San Francisco Chronicle Not enough has been changed to turn around anyone who already dislikes it, but in cutting out 13 minutes of runtime, the director has excised many of the small moments that made it uniquely memorable in the first place. Full Review | Mar 28, 2021 Wendy Shreve Featuring Film Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (Original title, The Godfather III, 1990) reminds viewers what was once memorable can be new again. Full Review | Jan 29, 2021 Rob Gonsalves Rob's Movie Vault "Godfather, Coda" is not perfect by any means, and doesn't share the cool intelligence of I and II, but it's time to stop punishing it. It is its own movie. Cosmetically it resembles the first two, but its core is jagged and despairing. Full Review | Original Score: A-                                  | Jan 19, 2021 Gabriel Quispe Cinencuentro Leaves us with with the impression that [Coppola] is happy "redirecting" and putting some final points on his part. [Full review in Spanish] Full Review | Jan 6, 2021 James Kendrick Q Network Film Desk although not in the league with its predecessors, it is still an invigorating, deeply felt piece of work Full Review | Original Score: 3.5/4                                  | Dec 25, 2020 Adam Solomons HeyUGuys A triumph of a revisitation -Coppola's recut breathes new life into his final Godfather film. While it does not elevated to the quality of its predecessors there is a weight, a gravitas to this new film, which makes it finally worthy of the name. Full Review | Original Score: 4/5                                  | Dec 22, 2020 John Anderson America Magazine Much is tailored to the needs of drama in "Godfather, Coda." But one cannot manufacture urgency in a film that lacks the kind of cosmic conflict of its two predecessors. Full Review | Dec 18, 2020 David Ehrlich IndieWire It's often gripping, sometimes masterful, and almost never betrays its history as the work of a wayward giant scrambling back toward respectability after a long decade lost in the wilderness. Full Review | Dec 18, 2020 Matt Brunson Film Frenzy It's a mixed bag of a movie, with some strong sequences and several potent performances (particularly by Al Pacino and Andy Garcia) competing against a meandering storyline and the absence of Robert Duvall and Winona Ryder. Full Review | Original Score: 2.5/4                                  | Dec 17, 2020 Matt Neal ABC Radio (Australia) The Godfather Coda is not worthless, nor is it wholly necessary. Full Review | Original Score: 3/5                                  | Dec 17, 2020 Andrew Gaudion VultureHound The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone gives fans the chance to at least go in with a different sense of expectation. Full Review | Original Score: 4/5                                  | Dec 14, 2020 Jonathan Dean Sunday Times (UK) In 1990 it felt out of time, with Martin Scorsese bringing out the vibrant Goodfellas, but, decades on and with a new beginning and end, its stateliness and pace work well to unravel the mental torment suffered by the Mob boss Corleone... Full Review | Original Score: 4/5                                  | Dec 14, 2020 Richard Brody The New Yorker The film's tautly controlled turbulence guides the eye to salient details, its clarified lines of dramatic tension calmly burst into images of an explosive yet nearly static intensity.
