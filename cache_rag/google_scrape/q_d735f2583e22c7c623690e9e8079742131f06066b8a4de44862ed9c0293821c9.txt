[+] Women's singles match during day two of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London, Tuesday, July 2, 2019. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis) ASSOCIATED PRESS Serena Williams won her first-round match at Wimbledon on Tuesday, and also said she will play mixed doubles with Andy Murray. After taking care of Italy's Giulia Gatto-Monticone 6-2, 7-5 on Centre Court, Williams was asked about the possibility of playing mixed with Murray, the two-time Wimbledon singles champ who is competing in men's doubles and mixed doubles but not singles. "Done," she said, according to Stuart Fraser of The Times of London . Before that she said she was "going to see how she feels"  and then added, "I could use extra matches, though." Said Murray : "I’m definitely playing in the mixed. I have got my partner – well 90 per cent sure. “Is it Serena? Possibly. I just need to just confirm it." The deadline to enter the mixed doubles is on Wednesday at 11 a.m. London time. In singles, Williams, 37, is still pursuing her 24th major Grand Slam title, which would tie her with Margaret Court for first all-time. Williams, who is seeking to become the fourth mother in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam title, hasn't won a tournament of any kind since beating her older sister Venus in the 2017 Australian Open final. Venus on Monday lost in the first round of Wimbledon to 15-year-old American Coco Gauff. Since becoming a mother in September 2017 and then dealing with serious health issues in the aftermath, Serena has played 13 events without winning a title. She is 28-9 in that span, 22-4 at majors. William, who is worth an estimated $225 million according to Forbes , has been bothered by a knee injury this year and was forced to withdraw from three straight events because of it, and lost in the third round at the French Open to Sofia Kenin. But she says she's much better now after resting and training heading into Wimbledon. She won the match at met after a back-and-forth point that ended with Williams putting away a two-handed backhand volley winner. Off to a flying start in the first round. Will 2019 be the year @serenawilliams wins her eighth #Wimbledon women’s singles title? pic.twitter.com/XVQxSAdVLB — Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 2, 2019 "This was the best I've felt since February," Williams said on the BBC. "I pretty much had to skip most of the hardcourt season and just a couple matches on clay. I'm feeling good, so it's just so amazing. "I am better now. I haven't felt this way since February. I just feel so thankful and I am happy, and now I get to play with my baby. And it's fun, I get to do everything I love." Williams is in the so-called "Group of Death" that initially had seven Grand Slam champions in it. World No. 1 Ash Barty and reigning Wimbledon champ Angelique Kerber -- who beat Serena in last year's final -- both also won their opening-round matches Tuesday. Barty beat Zheng Saisai of China, 6-4, 6-2, and will now play Belgian Alison van Uytvanck. Kerber knocked off fellow German Tatjana Maria. 6-4, 6-3 and faces American world No. 95 Lauren Davis in round two. There are 10 American women into the second round. Follow me on Twitter .
