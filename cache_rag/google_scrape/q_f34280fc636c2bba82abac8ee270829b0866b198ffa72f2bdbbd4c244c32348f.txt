He did a video interview, and uhhh, he said a LOT. A few direct quotes thanks to Angie : "I know a bit about the [next Silent Hill game]. I work with the Silent Team, the original creators. I work in collaboration with Konami." "I'm working with the Silent Team, the original creators at Konami, there are several games in development as we speak, there are several teams on it, with a big line of games, they will revive the franchise, I think they were really impressed of the success of the remakes of Resident Evil that are evidently exceptional games." "I'm not working directly on the games but I'm working with Konami but not with Kojima, tho, but with the Silent Team who I met when I filmed the first Silent Hill movie." "And they're still here" "In this second movie, I'll try to explain that Silent Hill is a place that owes as much to the creatures that live there as what we project on the town. So I'll enter into something way more psychological and way more psychoanalytic in order to try to make people understand that Silent Hill isn't only this strange labyrinth that changes its form but also the projection of tortured and tormented souls and sometimes of extremely paradoxical feelings that can be between mad love and violence." Interviewer: "So who are developing the games?" Christophe: "It's Konami, there are several games." Interviewer: "Because we know Bloober Team are working on Silent Hill 2 Remake" Christophe: "Yes" Interviewer: "And we don't know who's developing the others." Christophe: "Yeah, there are several teams." ------ In basic, he confirmed there's several Silent Hill projects in development right now in Konami and between several different teams, he's seen some stuff off of one Silent Hill game that's being worked on by people who worked on the original four Silent Hill games who he worked with back in the 2000s on the first film who are also working on this game revival. Confirms Bloober is working on a Silent Hill 2 Remake, confirms several of the series original creators and developers are working on these projects. He also talks some about how his next film is planned to be more psychological and to focus on the strange reality of the town of Silent Hill itself. I'm honestly flabbergasted he was allowed to say that much, but very interesting! Angie Best Avatar Thread Ever!

He probably didn't work with Masahiro Ito, but he did work with Konami and people who worked on the games before 2006 (when the movie came out), movies take a few years and companies often work with people working on their properties. He's just confirming some of the same people he's worked with, and he's seen some of at least one of the projects.

Darkknight2149 Ban made permanent due to harassment of staff Banned May 27, 2020 6,415 Oct 7, 2022 #23 The Bloober Team remake is dead to me, but I'm really looking forward to The Short Message , Silent Hill 5 , and the Annapurna Interactive game, and what Masahiro Ito can bring to a new iteration. I don't have much faith in Christophe Gans' ability to pull off Silent Hill (his previous film only got the aesthetics right), but he at least seems to have the right influences this time. He mentioned taking inspiration from films like Hereditary and Midsommar , which is more in line with Silent Hill than the Evil Dead and Children of the Corn crap the 2006 film was doing. Gavalanche Prophet of Regret Member Oct 21, 2021 25,430 Oct 7, 2022 #24 Just announce the damn game or games. It's like everyone in the games industry knows of them, and even outside it.

Yeah, you're ahead of where I am but I get the sense that's what happened too, interviewer played it coy and acted like all of this was public knowledge already, which I think made Gans think it was all already out there now. If there really is a Silent Hill announcement this month in relation to Short Message as speculated, that also might've confused him since its October already, but that's speculation on my part (this interview seems to have happened in early October).

Click to expand... Click to shrink... Or he's just bullshitting and using the same talking points the internet has been yammering about for over a year now. Like this "movie" of his hasn't even hit the film industry trades yet - despite him repeatedly trying to bring it up in interviews - and it's supposed to be filming in a few months? The film industry has a much more ordered production cycle than the game industry and the fact he's the only one who has said anything about it just feels like aspirational talk rather than reality. The MGS movie is probably further along than this project and the MGS movie also doesn't exist. Kromeo said: The movie was pretty decent as far as game adaptations go Click to expand... Click to shrink... It kinda butchered every aspect of the lore and really only succeeded in LOOKING like Silent Hill. Yeah, it's not "bottom of the barrel" game adaptation status but it's still a bad movie and a bad translation of Silent Hill.

Click to shrink... Given how deep, complex, psychological, and atmospheric the games are, the film was basically the opposite of Silent Hill . It nailed the visuals and music, but it's not the super-faithful adaptation that perfectly captured the spirit of the games that it gets mistaken for. Scenes like this are distinctly un- Silent Hill : View: https://youtu.be/Rxs_ULxkNqs View: https://youtu.be/jB8NvayyPFU However, it's one of the better video game movies (which isn't saying much).

My point is that nerds can and will set the whole world on fire, for years, if MUCH ANTICIPATED NERD THING surprises or swerves them in any way. They get extremely upset whenever whatever they expect to happen doesn't happen. Blackbird Unshakable Resolve - Prophet of Truth Member Oct 25, 2017 7,187 Brazil Oct 7, 2022 #49 I think the secrecy of projects is an industry-made problem at this point that snowballed into something huge. Companies are desperately trying to control the image and narrative about their products, to the point they're willing, freaking terrified about answering the most ignorant and mean-spirited arguments instead of trying to convey reality like it is. Of course the usual costumer won't know games early in dev look like shit, will get frustrated about things changing and being cancelled all the time, but if you keep focusing on them like the most important aspect of the conversation you're never getting out of that hole, they'll feel validated and execs will fear losing control to them always. I'm impressed CD Projekt Red talked openly on what they're working and that's the stuff this industry needs. I understand creators want to show their work when it is ready, it's just that at this point it is getting ridiculously harmful especially when dumb suits punish devs themselves out of panic. Hollywood gets it (for all their insane list of mistakes too). Things change, some cool stuff never see the light of the day and yes, it is sad, but we don't have to be held hostage by angry internet posters acting like manchilds.

The diffference is The Last Jedi literally  ruined  the character a lot of  people -  grew with  or were familiar with or  learn about  from  the books and older movies - in order to achieve what exactly?  Subversion of expectations? And who asked for that? Anyway the whole  new Star Wars trilogy can described by "somehow stuff  happened".   Granted the first  move was good, I can give Force Awakens a credit in that regard at least. 1 2 3 Next 1 of 3 Go to page Go Next Last You must log in or register to reply here.
