[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The philosophy focuses on minimizing government regulation, censorship, or anything else in the way of a "free" World Wide Web . In this case, the word "free" is referring to the meaning of libre (no restrictions), not gratis (no cost). Cyber-libertarians embrace fluid, meritocratic hierarchies, which are believed to be best served by markets. The most widely known cyberlibertarian is Julian Assange . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The term technolibertarian was popularized in critical discourse by technology writer Paulina Borsook . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Notable proponents [ edit ] Julian Assange John Perry Barlow John Gilmore T. J. Rodgers Andrew Yang Elon Musk [ 10 ] [ 11 ] See also [ edit ] Censorship of Wikipedia Crypto-anarchism Free-culture movement Freedom of information Freedom of speech Information wants to be free Internet freedom Libertarian transhumanism Technocapitalism Technocracy The Californian Ideology References [ edit ] ^ Dahlberg, Lincoln (2016).
