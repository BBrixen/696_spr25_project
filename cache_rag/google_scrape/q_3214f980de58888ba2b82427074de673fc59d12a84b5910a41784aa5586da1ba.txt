She served as the party's president from 2011 to 2021, and ran for the French presidency in the 2012 , 2017 and 2022 elections. She has been the member of the National Assembly for the 11th constituency of Pas-de-Calais since 2017. She has been parliamentary party leader of the National Rally in the Assembly since June 2022 . Le Pen is the youngest daughter of former party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen and the aunt of former FN MP Marion Maréchal . Le Pen joined the FN in 1986. She was elected as a regional councillor of Nord-Pas-de-Calais (1998–2004; 2010–2015), Île-de-France (2004–2010) and Hauts-de-France (2015–2021), a Member of European Parliament (2004–2017), as well as a municipal councillor of Hénin-Beaumont (2008–2011). She won the leadership of the FN in 2011, with 67.6% of the vote, defeating Bruno Gollnisch and succeeding her father, who had been president of the party since he founded it in 1972. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] In 2012, she placed third in the presidential election with 17.9% of the vote, behind François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] She launched a second bid for the presidency at the 2017 election . She finished second in the first round of the election with 21.3% of the vote and faced Emmanuel Macron of centrist party En Marche! in the second round of voting. On 7 May 2017, she conceded after receiving approximately 33.9% of the vote in the second round. [ 7 ] In 2020, she announced her third candidacy for the presidency in the 2022 election . She came second in the first round of the election with 23.2% of the votes, thus qualifying her for the second round against Macron, [ 8 ] losing in the second round after receiving 41.5% of the votes. Le Pen has led a movement of " de-demonisation of the National Front " to soften its image, [ 9 ] including limited expulsion of members accused of racism , antisemitism or Pétainism . She expelled her father from the party in August 2015, after he made fresh controversial statements. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] While liberalizing some political positions of the party by revoking its opposition to same-sex partnerships , its opposition to unconditional abortions , and its support for the death penalty , Le Pen still advocates many of the same historical policies of her party, with particular focus on strong anti-immigration , nationalist and protectionist measures. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] She is supportive of economic nationalism , favoring an interventionist role of government , and is opposed to globalization and multiculturalism . Le Pen supports limiting immigration and banning ritual slaughter . [ 15 ] She has made supportive comments of Vladimir Putin and Russia in the past, advocating closer cooperation before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ; she strongly condemned the war in Ukraine , but stated Russia could become " an ally of France again " if it ends. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] She has supported Israel during the Gaza war . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Time named Le Pen one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2015. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] In 2016, Politico named her the second-most influential MEP in the European Parliament , after President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz . [ 22 ] In January 2024, after months of rising polling numbers, and for the first time ever, Le Pen became the most popular politician in France according to a Verian -Epoka for Le Figaro Magazine . [ 23 ] On 31 March 2025, Le Pen, eight other MEPs, and 12 assistants were convicted of embezzlement for misappropriating over €4 million European Parliament funds to fund National Front staff.  The sentences for several MEPs included bans from running for political office. Le Pen was sentenced to four years in prison and a five-year ban from running for political office, effectively disqualifying her from the upcoming 2027 French presidential election . She was also fined €100,000. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Early life and family [ edit ] Marion Anne Perrine Le Pen was born on 5 August 1968 in Neuilly-sur-Seine , [ 30 ] [ 31 ] the youngest of three daughters of Jean-Marie Le Pen (1928–2025), a Breton politician and former paratrooper , and his first wife, Pierrette Le Pen . She was baptized on 25 April 1969 at La Madeleine Church in Paris. Her godfather was Henri Botey, a relative of her father. [ 32 ] Le Pen has two sisters: Yann and Marie-Caroline . In 1976, when Marine was eight, a bomb meant for her father exploded in the stairwell outside the family's apartment as they slept. [ 33 ] The blast ripped a hole in the outside wall of the building, but Marine, her two older sisters and their parents were unharmed. [ 34 ] She was a student at the Lycée Florent Schmitt in Saint-Cloud . Her mother left the family in 1984 when Marine was 16. Le Pen wrote in her autobiography that the effect was "the most awful, cruel, crushing of pains of the heart: my mother did not love me." [ 35 ] Her parents divorced in 1987. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Legal studies and work [ edit ] Le Pen studied law at Panthéon-Assas University , graduating with a Master of Laws in 1991 and a Master of Advanced Studies (DEA) in criminal law in 1992. [ 38 ] Registered at the Paris bar association , she worked as a lawyer for six years (1992–1998), [ 38 ] appearing regularly before the criminal chamber of the 23rd district court of Paris which judges immediate appearances, and often acting as a public defender . She was a member of the Paris Bar until 1998, when she joined the legal department of the National Front. Early political career [ edit ] 1986–2010: Rise within the National Front [ edit ] Marine Le Pen joined the FN in 1986, at the age of 18. She acquired her first political mandate in 1998 when she was elected a Regional Councillor for Nord-Pas-de-Calais . In the same year, she joined the FN's juridical branch, which she led until 2003. In 2000, she became president of Generations Le Pen , a loose association close to the party which aimed at " de-demonizing the Front National". [ 36 ] She became a member the FN Executive Committee (French: bureau politique ) in 2000, and vice-president of the FN in 2003. [ 36 ] In 2006, she managed the presidential campaign of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. She became one of the two executive vice-presidents of the FN in 2007, with responsibility for training, communication and publicity. [ 38 ] In the 2007 parliamentary election , she contested Pas-de-Calais' 14th constituency but came second behind incumbent Socialist MP Albert Facon . [ 39 ] 2010–11: Leadership campaign [ edit ] Early in 2010, Le Pen expressed her intention to run for leader of the FN, saying that she hoped to make the party "a big popular party that addresses itself not only to the electorate on the right but to all the French people". [ 3 ] On 3 September 2010, she launched her leadership campaign at Cuers , Var. [ 40 ] During a meeting in Paris on 14 November 2010, she said that her goal was "not only to assemble our political family. It consists of shaping the Front National as the center of grouping of the whole French people", adding that in her view the FN leader should be the party's candidate in the 2012 presidential election . [ 41 ] She spent four months campaigning for the FN leadership, holding meetings with FN members in 51 departments . [ 42 ] All the other departments were visited by one of her official supporters. [ 43 ] During her final meeting of the campaign in Hénin-Beaumont on 19 December 2010, she claimed that the FN would present the real debate of the next presidential campaign. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Her candidacy was endorsed by a majority of senior figures in the party, [ 43 ] including her father. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] On several occasions during her campaign she ruled out any political alliance with the Union for a Popular Movement . [ 48 ] [ 49 ] She also distanced herself from some of Jean-Marie Le Pen's most controversial statements, [ 50 ] such as those relating to war crimes , which was reported in the media as attempts to improve the party's image. While her father had attracted controversy by saying that the mass murder of Jews in gas chambers during the Holocaust was "a detail of the history of World War II", she described genocide as "the height of barbarism". [ 51 ] [ 52 ] In December 2010 and early January 2011, FN members voted by post to elect their new president and the members of the central committee. The party held a congress at Tours on 15–16 January. [ 53 ] On 16 January 2011, Marine Le Pen was elected as the new president of the FN, with 67.65% of the vote (11,546 votes to 5,522 for Bruno Gollnisch ), [ 38 ] [ 54 ] and Jean-Marie Le Pen became honorary chairman. Muslim occupation comment [ edit ] Marine Le Pen received substantial media attention during the campaign as a result of comments, made during a speech to party members in Lyon on 10 December 2010, in which she compared the use of public streets and squares in French cities (in particular rue Myrha in the 18th arrondissement of Paris ) for Muslim prayers with the Nazi occupation of France . She said: For those who want to talk a lot about World War II, if it's about occupation, then we could also talk about it (Muslim prayers in the streets), because that is occupation of territory ... It is an occupation of sections of the territory, of districts in which religious laws apply ... There are of course no tanks, there are no soldiers, but it is nevertheless an occupation and it weighs heavily on local residents. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] Her comments were much criticised. Government spokesman François Baroin characterized her remarks as racist and xenophobic. [ 57 ] The Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions (CRIF), [ 58 ] the French Council of Muslim Faith (CFCM) [ 59 ] and the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA) [ 60 ] condemned her statement, and groups including MRAP (Movement Against Racism and for Friendship between Peoples) [ 61 ] and the French Human Rights League (LDH) [ 62 ] declared their intention to lodge a formal complaint. The imam of the Great Mosque of Paris and former president of the CFCM, Dalil Boubakeur , said that, while her parallel was questionable and to be condemned, she had asked a valid question. [ 63 ] Le Pen's partner Louis Aliot , [ 64 ] a member of the FN's Executive Committee, criticized "the attempted manipulation of opinion by communitarian groups and those really responsible for the current situation in France". [ 65 ] On 13 December 2010, Le Pen reasserted her statement during a press conference at the FN headquarters in Nanterre . [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] After Jean-François Kahn 's comments on BFM TV on 13 December 2010, she accused the Élysée Palace of organising "state manipulation" with the intention of demonizing her in public opinion. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] On 15 December 2015, a Lyon court acquitted her of "inciting hatred", ruling that her statement "did not target all of the Muslim community" and was protected "as a part of freedom of expression". [ 71 ] Leadership of the National Front/National Rally (2011–2022) [ edit ] Rebranding of the National Front [ edit ] Le Pen has pursued a policy of "de-demonisation" of her party, to reform its image away from the extremism associated with her father, the former leader of the party and to increase the appeal of the party to voters. This has included policy reform and personnel replacement, including the expulsion of her own father from the party in 2015. Measures aimed at de-demonisation have included dropping all references to World War II or to the French colonial wars , which is often looked on as a generation gap. [ 72 ] and distancing herself from her father's views. [ 73 ] Marine Le Pen in the traditional Jeanne d'Arc march, 3 May 2007 Bernard-Henri Lévy , a strong opponent of the FN, described Le Pen's leadership of it as "far-right with a human face". [ 74 ] The measures have also attracted criticism from former allies as making the party too mainstream, abandoning long-held policies and ignoring grassroots support. [ 75 ] In a 2010 RTL interview, Le Pen stated that her strategy was not about changing the FN's program but about showing it as it really is, instead of the image given to it by the media in the previous decades. The media and her political adversaries are accused of spreading an "unfair, wrong and caricatural" image of the National Front. She refuses the qualification of far-right or extreme-right, considering it a pejorative term: "How am I party of the extreme right? ... I don't think that our propositions are extreme propositions, whatever the subject". [ 37 ] In 2014, the American magazine Foreign Policy mentioned her, along with four other French people, in its list of the 100 global thinkers of the year, underlining the way she "renovated the image" of her party, which had become a model for other right-wing parties in Europe after her success in the European elections . [ 76 ] At a European level, she stopped the alliance built by her father with some right-wing extremist parties and refused to be part of a group with the radical Jobbik or the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn . Her transnational allies share the fact that they have officially condemned antisemitism , accepted a more liberal approach toward social matters, and are sometimes pro-Israel such as the Dutch PVV . French historian Nicolas Lebourg concluded that she is looked upon as a compass for them to follow while maintaining local particularities. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] While other European populists embraced Donald Trump 's candidacy in the 2016 U.S. presidential election , she said only, "For France, anything is better than Hillary Clinton ". However, on 8 November 2016, she posted a tweet congratulating Trump on his election. [ 79 ] [ non-primary source needed ] Her social program and her support of SYRIZA in the 2015 Greek general elections led Nicolas Sarkozy to declare her a far-left politician sharing some of Jean-Luc Mélenchon 's propositions. President François Hollande said she was talking "like a leaflet of the Communist Party ". Éric Zemmour , then known as a journalist for the conservative newspaper Le Figaro , wrote during the 2012 presidential election that the FN had become a left-wing party under the influence of adviser Florian Philippot . She has also relaxed some political positions of the party, advocating for civil unions for same-sex couples instead of her party's previous opposition to legal recognition of same-sex partnerships, accepting current abortion laws, and withdrawing the restitution of the death penalty from her platform. [ 12 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Despite Le Pen's attempts to make the National Front more palatable to the international community, the party and Le Pen herself continue to attract criticism: German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she "will contribute to make other political forces stronger than the National Front"; [ 82 ] Israel still holds a negative opinion of her party; [ 83 ] [ 84 ] and former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage – himself a frequent critic of Islam and immigration [ 85 ] [ 86 ] – has said, "I've never said a bad word about Marine Le Pen; I've never said a good word about her party". [ 87 ] First steps as a New leader (2011) [ edit ] Supporters of Marine Le Pen in 2011 As a president of the Front National, Marine Le Pen currently sits as an ex officio member among the FN Executive Office (8 members), [ 88 ] the Executive Committee (42 members) [ 89 ] and the Central Committee (3 ex officio members, 100 elected members, 20 co-opted members). [ 90 ] During her opening speech in Tours on 16 January 2011, she advocated to "restore the political framework of the national community" and to implement the direct democracy which enables the "civic responsibility and the collective tie" thanks to the participation of public-spirited citizens for the decisions. The predominant political theme was the uncompromising defence of a protective and efficient state , which favours secularism , prosperity and liberties. She also denounced the "Europe of Brussels" which "everywhere imposed the destructive principles of ultra-liberalism and free trade , at the expense of public utilities, employment, social equity and even our economic growth which became within twenty years the weakest of the world". [ 91 ] After the traditional Joan of Arc march and Labour Day march in Paris on 1 May 2011, she gave her first speech in front of 3,000 supporters. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] On 10 and 11 September 2011, she made her political comeback with the title "the voice of people, the spirit of France" in the convention center of Acropolis in Nice . [ 94 ] During her closing speech she addressed immigration, insecurity, the economic and social situation, reindustrialization and 'strong state'. [ 95 ] During a demonstration held in front of the Senate on 8 December 2011, she expressed in a speech her "firm and absolute opposition" to the right of foreigners to vote . [ 96 ] She regularly held thematic press conferences [ 97 ] and interventions [ 98 ] on varied issues in French, European and international politics. First presidential candidacy (2011–2012) [ edit ] Main articles: French presidential election, 2012 and Marine Le Pen presidential campaign, 2012 Le Pen on 19 November 2011 in Paris announcing her presidential candidacy (top) and singing " La Marseillaise " at the conclusion of her presentation (bottom) On 16 May 2011, Marine Le Pen's presidential candidacy was unanimously approved by the FN Executive Committee. [ 99 ] On 10 and 11 September 2011, she launched her presidential campaign in Nice . [ 95 ] On 6 October 2011, she held a press conference to introduce the members of her presidential campaign team. [ 100 ] In a speech in Paris on 19 November 2011, Le Pen presented the main themes of her presidential campaign: sovereignty of the people and democracy, Europe, re-industrialisation and a strong state, family and education, immigration and assimilation versus communitarianism , geopolitics and international politics. [ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ] At a press conference on 12 January 2012, [ 104 ] she presented a detailed assessment of her presidential project, [ 105 ] and a plan to reduce France's debt. [ 106 ] At another press conference on 1 February 2012, she outlined her policies for the overseas departments and territories of France. [ 107 ] Many observers noted her tendency to focus on economic and social issues such as globalization and delocalisations, rather than immigration or law and order, which had until then been the central issues for the FN. On 11 December 2011, she held her first campaign meeting in Metz , [ 108 ] [ 109 ] and from early January to mid-April 2012, she held similar meetings each week in the major French cities. On 17 April 2012, between 6,000 and 7,000 people participated part in her final campaign meeting, held at the Zenith in Paris . [ 110 ] [ 111 ] On 13 March 2012, she announced that she had collected the 500 signatures required to take part in the presidential election. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] On 19 March 2012, the Constitutional Council approved her candidacy, and those of nine competitors. [ 4 ] On 22 April 2012, she polled 17.90% (6,421,426 votes) in the first round, finishing in third position behind François Hollande and incumbent president Nicolas Sarkozy . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] She achieved better results, in both percentage vote-share and number of votes, than her father had in the 2002 presidential election (16.86%, 4,804,772 votes in the first round; 17.79%, 5,525,034 votes in the run-off). [ 114 ] Marine Le Pen during her presidential campaign, on 15 April 2012 First round results in 2012: candidates with the most votes by departments (mainland France, overseas and French citizens living abroad). Marine Le Pen came first in Gard. Le Pen polled first in Gard (25.51%, 106,646 votes), with Sarkozy and Hollande polling 24.86% (103,927 votes) and 24.11% (100,778 votes) respectively. [ 6 ] [ 115 ] She also came first in her municipal stronghold of Hénin-Beaumont (35.48%, 4,924 votes), where Hollande and Sarkozy polled 26.82% (3,723 votes) and 15.76% (2,187 votes) respectively. [ 116 ] She achieved her highest results east of the line from Le Havre in the north to Perpignan in the south, [ 117 ] and conversely she won fewer votes in western France, especially cities such as Paris, overseas and among French citizens living abroad (5.95%, 23,995 votes). [ 118 ] However, she polled well in two rural departments in western France: Orne (20.00%, 34,757 votes) [ 119 ] and Sarthe (19.17%, 62,516 votes). [ 120 ] Her highest regional result was in Picardy (25.03%, 266,041 votes), [ 121 ] her highest departmental result in Vaucluse (27.03%, 84,585 votes), [ 122 ] and her highest overseas result in Saint Pierre and Miquelon (15.81%, 416 votes). [ 123 ] First round results 2012: candidates with the most votes by municipalities in metropolitan France (dark gray: Marine Le Pen) She achieved her lowest regional result in Île-de-France (12.28%, 655,926 votes), [ 124 ] her lowest departmental result in Paris (6.20%, 61,503 votes), [ 125 ] and her lowest overseas result in Wallis and Futuna (2.37%, 152 votes). [ 126 ] French sociologist Sylvain Crépon, who analysed the social and occupational groups of the FN voters in 2012, explained: "The FN vote is made up of the victims of globalisation. It is the small shopkeepers who are going under because of the economic crisis and competition from the out-of-town hypermarkets; it is low-paid workers from the private sector; the unemployed. The FN scores well among people living in poverty, who have a real fear about how to make ends meet." [ 117 ] Crépon also analysed the increase of the FN vote in "rural" areas and the recent sociological changes in these areas made up of small provincial towns and new housing-estate commuter belts built on the distant outskirts of the cities: "The rural underclass is no longer agricultural. It is people who have fled the big cities and the inner suburbs because they can no longer afford to live there. Many of these people will have had recent experience of living in the banlieues (high immigration suburbs) – and have had contact with the problems of insecurity." [ 117 ] Commentators also pointed that there were more young people and women voting for the party in 2012. [ 117 ] On 1 May 2012, during a speech delivered in Paris after the traditional Joan of Arc and Labor Day march, Le Pen refused to back either Sarkozy or Hollande in the run-off on 6 May. Addressing the party's annual rally at Place de l'Opéra , she vowed to cast a blank ballot and told her supporters to vote with their conscience, saying: "Hollande and Sarkozy – neither of them will save you. On Sunday I will cast a blank protest vote . I have made my choice. Each of you will make yours." Accusing both candidates of surrendering to Europe and financial markets, she asked: "Who between Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy will impose the austerity plan in the most servile way? Who will submit the best to the instructions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB) or the European Commission?". [ 127 ] Electoral results (2012–2016) [ edit ] Following the increase in support for the FN in the presidential election, Le Pen announced the formation an electoral coalition to contest the June 2012 parliamentary elections called the Blue Marine Gathering . Standing as a candidate in the Pas-de-Calais' 11th constituency , Le Pen won 42.36% of the vote, well ahead of the Socialist representative Philippe Kemel (23.50%) and far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon (21.48%). She was defeated by Kemel in the second round with 49.86% and filed an appeal with the Constitutional Council , which was rejected despite an observation of some irregularities. Nationally, the FN had two lawmakers elected: Le Pen's niece Marion Maréchal and Gilbert Collard . In 2014, Le Pen led the party to further electoral advances in the municipal and senatorial elections : eleven mayors and two senators were elected, with the FN entering the upper chamber for the first time. France's regional elections in 2015 On 24 May 2014, the FN received the most votes in the European elections in France , with a 24.90% share. Marine Le Pen came in first place in her North-West constituency with 33.60%. 25 FN representatives were elected to the European Parliament from France. They voted against the Juncker Commission when it was formed in July 2014. One year later, Le Pen announced the formation of Europe of Nations and Freedom , a parliamentary grouping composed of the National Front, the Freedom Party of Austria , Lega Nord of Italy, the Dutch Party for Freedom , the Congress of the New Right from Poland , the Flemish Vlaams Belang of Belgium , and British independent MEP Janice Atkinson , formerly of UKIP . Le Pen's first attempt to assemble this grouping in 2014 had failed due to UKIP and the Sweden Democrats refusing to join, as well as some controversial statements from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen . Le Pen sat on the commission for international trade. In 2016, Politico ranked her as the second most influential MEP after Martin Schulz . In April 2015, Le Pen's father gave two interviews including controversial statements about World War II and about minorities in France, causing a political crisis in the FN. Marine Le Pen organised a postal vote to ask FN members to change the party's statutes to expel her father. J-M Le Pen pursued his movement and the justice cancelled the vote. On 25 August, the FN executive office voted to expel him from the party he had founded forty years earlier. Marine's dependence on her closest adviser, Florian Philippot , a former left-wing technocrat, was observed. The party instigated a purge to expel the members who had opposed the changes within the FN under Marine Le Pen's leadership. Le Pen subsequently announced her candidacy for the presidency of the regional council of Nord-Pas-de-Calais-Picardie in the 2015 regional elections , though she expressed her regret over the proximity of these elections to the next presidential election. On 6 December, she finished first with 40.6% of the vote, but the Socialist candidate (third with 18.12%) withdrew and declared support for her right-wing opponent Xavier Bertrand , who won with 57.80% of the vote. Her niece Marion also lost, under similar circumstances, by a smaller margin. Second presidential candidacy (2016–2017) [ edit ] Main article: French presidential election, 2017 Leading candidate in polls [ edit ] Marine Le Pen's 2017 campaign logo Marine Le Pen announced her candidacy for the 2017 French presidential election on 8 April 2016. She appointed FN Senator David Rachline as her campaign manager. The FN had difficulty finding funding because of the refusal of French banks to provide credit. Instead, the FN borrowed € 9 million from the First Czech-Russian Bank in Moscow in 2014, despite European Union sanctions placed on Russia following the annexation of Crimea . In February 2016, the FN asked Russia for another loan, this time of € 27 million, but the second loan was not paid. [ 16 ] Marine Le Pen during her presidential campaign, on 26 March 2017 Political analysts suggested that Le Pen's strong position in opinion polls was due to the absence of a primary in her party (consolidating her leadership), the news of the migrant crisis and terrorist attacks in France (reinforcing her political positions) and the very right-wing campaign of Nicolas Sarkozy in the Republican primary (enlarging her themes). In a 2016 interview with the BBC , Le Pen said that Donald Trump 's victory in the US presidential election would help her, saying that Trump had "made possible what had previously been presented as impossible". [ 128 ] However, she said she would not officially launch her campaign before February 2017, waiting for the results of the Republican and Socialist primaries, and preferred to keep a low media profile and use thematic think tanks to expand and promote her political program. As a result, her rare media appearances attracted large audiences (2.3 million viewers for Vie politique on TF1 on 11 September 2016 and 4 million for Une ambition intime on M6 on 16 October). The FN's communications also received media attention: a new Mitterrand -inspired poster depicting her in a rural landscape with the slogan "Appeased France" was a response to surveys indicating that she remained controversial for large parts of the French electorate. Satirical treatment of this poster led to the slogan being changed to: "In the name of the people". Meanwhile, the FN logo and the name Le Pen were removed from campaign posters. Le Pen launched her candidacy on 4 and 5 February 2017 in Lyon , promising a referendum on France's membership of the European Union if she could not achieve her territorial, monetary, economic and legislative goals for the country within six months renegotiation with the EU. Her first campaign appearance on television, four days later, received the highest viewing figures on France 2 since the previous presidential election (16.70% with 3.7 million viewers). [ 129 ] Her 2017 presidential campaign emphasized Le Pen as a softer, feminine figure, with a blue rose as a prominent campaign symbol. [ 130 ] Campaign [ edit ] Main article: 2017 Marine Le Pen presidential campaign On 2 March 2017, the European Parliament voted to revoke Le Pen's immunity from prosecution for tweeting violent imagery. Le Pen had tweeted an image of beheaded journalist James Foley in December 2015, which was deleted following a request from Foley's family. Le Pen also faced prosecution for allegedly spending EU Parliament funds on her own political party; the lifting of her immunity from prosecution did not apply to the ongoing investigation into the misuse of parliamentary funds by the FN. [ 131 ] Marine Le Pen and Vladimir Putin in Moscow on 24 March 2017 Le Pen met with several incumbent heads of state including Lebanon's Michel Aoun , [ 132 ] Chad's Idriss Déby , [ 133 ] and Russia's Vladimir Putin . [ 134 ] The ground floor of the building which housed Le Pen's campaign headquarters was targeted by an arson attempt during the early morning of 13 April 2017. [ 135 ] [ 136 ] In 2017, Le Pen argued that France as a nation bore no responsibility for the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup , in which Paris policemen arrested Jewish citizens for deportation to Auschwitz as part of the Holocaust . She repeated a Gaullist thesis according to which France was not represented by the Vichy regime , but by Charles de Gaulle 's Free France . [ 137 ] On 20 April 2017, in the wake of a shooting targeting police officers which was being treated as a suspected terrorist attack, Le Pen cancelled a planned campaign event. The next day, she called for the closure of all "extremist" mosques, a remark that was criticised by Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve , who accused her of attempting to "capitalise" on the incident. She also called for the expulsion of hate preachers and people on the French security services' watch list, and the revocation of their citizenship. The Guardian said the attack could serve as "ammunition" for right-wing candidates in the election, including Le Pen. [ 138 ] On 21 April 2017, United States President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that the shooting would have "a big effect on the presidential election". [ 139 ] Later that day, Trump said that Le Pen was the "strongest on borders, and she's the strongest on what's been going on in France". [ 140 ] Meanwhile, former US President Barack Obama phoned Emmanuel Macron to express his support. [ 141 ] Second round [ edit ] Results of the first round of the 2017 presidential election. Departments in which Le Pen received the largest share of the vote are shaded dark blue. Le Pen won 21.3% of the vote (7.7 million votes) in the first round of the election on 23 April 2017, placing her second behind Macron, who received 24.0%, [ 142 ] meaning that they would face each other in the run-off on 7 May. On 24 April 2017, the day after the first round of voting, Le Pen announced that she would temporarily step down as the leader of the FN in an attempt to unite voters. [ 143 ] "The President of the Republic is the president of all the French people, they must bring them all together", she said. [ 144 ] [ non-primary source needed ] After progressing to the second round, she said that the campaign was now "a referendum for or against France" and tried to convince those voting for the hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon to support her. This choice was later criticised by those in her party who believed that she had abandoned François Fillon 's voters in spite of their conservative and anti-immigration stance. On 1 May 2017, a video emerged of Le Pen copying sections of a speech by Francois Fillon word-for-word. [ 145 ] In the first days of the second round campaign, the gap in opinion polls began to narrow. On 25 April, Le Pen went to Amiens in an unexpected visit to meet workers at the Whirlpool factory while Macron was in a meeting with local officials at the same time, with Le Pen receiving a positive welcome. Macron then also visited the factory workers, but was booed by a hostile crowd. Le Pen was generally regarded as the loser of the televised debate between the two candidates. Her performance was strongly criticised by politicians, commentators, and members of her own party, and described as a "sabotage" by conservative journalist Éric Zemmour . Le Pen herself subsequently acknowledged that she had "misfired" during the debate. In the following days, she began to slip in opinion polls. On 7 May, she conceded defeat to Emmanuel Macron. Her vote share of 33.9% was lower than any polls had predicted, and was attributed to her poor performance in the debate. She immediately announced a "full transformation" of the FN in the following months. [ 7 ] Member of the National Assembly: 2017–present [ edit ] On 18 May 2017, Le Pen announced that she would run as a candidate at the parliamentary elections in the Pas-de-Calais's 11th constituency , in her fifth attempt to be elected as a deputy . She received just under 46% of the vote in the first round, and won the second with just under 58% against Anne Roquet of En Marche . She became a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the National Assembly . She then resigned as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). [ 146 ] In 2019, it was reported that Le Pen no longer wants France to leave the European Union, nor for it to leave the euro currency. Instead, it was reported she and her party wants to change the EU bloc from the inside along with allied parties. [ 147 ] On 4 July 2021, she was elected again to lead the National Rally with no opposing candidate. [ 148 ] Third presidential candidacy and legislative election (2022) [ edit ] Results of the first round of the 2022 presidential election. Departments in which Le Pen received the largest share of the vote are shaded dark blue. Results of the second round of the 2022 legislative election. Constituencies in which Le Pen's party won the election are shaded dark blue. In January 2020, Le Pen announced her third candidacy for president of France in the 2022 presidential election . [ 149 ] On 15 January 2022, she launched her campaign. In February 2022, during Le Pen's presidential campaign, Stéphane Ravier , the only Senator from her political party, publicly endorsed her far-right presidential rival Zemmour. [ 150 ] During the first round of the election, Le Pen won second place, with 23.15% of the votes. [ 8 ] On 22 April, she participated in a televised debate against Macron. [ 151 ] She was defeated in a run-off against Emmanuel Macron on 24 April: on this occasion, she obtained 41.45% of the votes, the highest share of the vote for a nationalist candidate in French history. [ 152 ] It was remarked that a Є10.6 million loan provided by the Hungarian bank MKB Bank chaired by Lőrinc Mészáros , a close ally of Viktor Orbán , was used to finance her presidential campaign. [ 153 ] The transaction depended on Orban to be completed; normally the bankers would not have done it. [ 154 ] During the 2022 French legislative election which followed soon after, she led her party into winning its highest number of seats in the National Assembly since its founding, RN eventually becoming the largest opposition party in Parliament. [ 155 ] Days later, she was elected by acclamation as leader of the parliamentary National Rally party in the Assembly, a position she currently holds. Standing down [ edit ] In November 2022 Le Pen stood down from chairing the National Rally. She was succeeded by Jordan Bardella who had previously acted as the party's interim leader during her presidential campaign.

[ 158 ] Le Pen has called for a moratorium on legal immigration. [ 159 ] She would repeal laws allowing illegal immigrants to become legal residents, [ 95 ] and has argued that benefits provided to immigrants be reduced to remove incentives for new immigrants. [ 160 ] Following the beginning of the Arab Spring and the European migrant crisis , she called for France to withdraw from the Schengen Area and reinstate border controls. [ 161 ] [ 162 ] She supports restrictions on ritual slaughter .

[ 163 ] Economic policy [ edit ] On energy, Le Pen advocates a policy of energy independence for France, with a strong emphasis on support for nuclear and hydroelectric power . Le Pen is strongly opposed to wind energy due to its intermittency, tax burden in utility bills and impact on the landscape and built heritage.  She is proposing a moratorium on new wind energy development on both sea and land from 2022 and the eventual dismantling of all current wind turbines. [ 164 ] Le Pen favours protectionism as an alternative to free trade . [ 41 ] She supports economic nationalism , [ 165 ] the separation of investment and retail banking , [ 166 ] and energy diversification, [ 167 ] and is opposed to the privatization of public services and social security , [ 168 ] speculation on international commodity markets, [ 168 ] and is opposed to the Common Agricultural Policy . [ 169 ] Le Pen also supports maintaining France's system of sectoral bargaining and opposed Macron's reforms of the labour code. [ 170 ] Le Pen is opposed to globalization , which she blames for various negative economic trends, and opposes European Union supranationalism and federalism , instead favouring a loosely confederate 'Europe of the Nations'. [ 171 ] As of 2019, she no longer advocates for France to leave the EU or euro currency; [ 147 ] she had previously called both for France to leave the Eurozone [ 172 ] and for a referendum on France leaving the EU. [ 173 ] She has been a vocal opponent of the Treaty of Lisbon , [ 174 ] and opposes EU membership for Turkey and Ukraine . [ 175 ] [ 176 ] She proposes the replacement of the World Trade Organization [ 177 ] [ 178 ] and the abolition of the International Monetary Fund . [ 179 ] Foreign policy [ edit ] On foreign policy, Le Pen has criticised Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan . [ 180 ] She also criticised the privileged relations that France maintains with countries such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia , which she said are helping to fund and arm Islamist fundamentalists , [ 181 ] while encouraging closer ties with the United Arab Emirates and Egypt , which she said "fight fundamentalism". [ 182 ] She has said she believes that Ukraine has been "subjugated" by the United States. [ 183 ] She was strongly critical of NATO policy in the region, of Eastern European anti-Russian sentiment , [ 183 ] and of threatened economic sanctions. [ 176 ] In response to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Le Pen criticized Russia's action despite her previous pro-Russia stance. [ 184 ] She advocated welcoming Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war. [ 185 ] She has stated that if elected she would remove France from NATO's integrated military command. [ 186 ] In October 2023, she condemned Hamas ' actions during the Gaza war and expressed her support to Israel and its right to self-defense. [ 187 ] [ 188 ] In May 2024, she officially met with an Israeli government minister for the first time. [ 189 ] Other issues [ edit ] Regarding feminism , Le Pen often says she identifies as a feminist in the context of defending women's rights and improving women's lives, although she is critical of what she calls "neo-feminism", which she characterises as women going to war against men. [ 190 ] [ 191 ] [ 192 ] However, her position has been criticised as a false commitment, based on her votes. [ 193 ] [ 194 ] [ 195 ] Media image [ edit ] This section needs to be updated .

[ 205 ] In December 2010, French journalist Guillaume Tabard described Le Pen as the "revelation of the year", and as "first an electoral phenomenon" and "a media phenomenon after". [ 206 ] À vous de juger was replaced on France 2 by Des paroles et des actes (Words and Acts), hosted by journalist and anchorman David Pujadas . In her first appearance as a main guest on 23 June 2011, Le Pen appeared opposite Cécile Duflot , national secretary of The Greens . [ 207 ] [ 208 ] The broadcast was viewed by 3,582,000 viewers (15.1% of the television audience at the time).

She did not begin serving the two years' house arrest immediately as all appeals must be exhausted before this part of the sentence is executed. Similarly, she did not lose her seat in the lower house of the French parliament immediately. [ 233 ] On the other hand, the court also banned her, effective immediately, from standing for political office for five years, making her ineligible to run in the 2027 French presidential election . [ 234 ] Elections contested [ edit ] This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( August 2023 ) European elections [ edit ] In the 2004 European Parliament election , Le Pen led the FN list in the Île-de-France constituency. The list polled 8.58% (234,893 votes), winning one of fourteen available seats. [ 235 ] In the 2009 European parliament election , Le Pen led the FN list in the North-West France constituency. The party polled 10.18% (253,009 votes), [ 236 ] the highest FN vote share of French constituencies, and won one of the ten seats. [ 237 ] The FN's constituency list received its highest regional result in Picardy (12.57%, 63,624 votes), [ 238 ] its highest departmental result in Aisne (13.40%, 19,125 votes), [ 239 ] and its highest municipal results in Pas-de-Calais: Hénin-Beaumont (27.92%, 1,799 votes), [ 240 ] Courcelles-lès-Lens (26.57%), [ 241 ] Noyelles-Godault (24.72%). [ 242 ] Parliamentary elections [ edit ] Paris in 1993 [ edit ] Le Pen first stood for parliament in the 1993 legislative election , in Paris' 16th constituency ( 17th arrondissement of Paris ). She finished third with 11.10% (3,963 votes), and Bernard Pons ( UDR ) was re-elected as the MP with 63.14% (22,545 votes) in the first round. [ 243 ] Lens in 2002 [ edit ] She stood in the 2002 election in Pas-de-Calais' 13th constituency , Lens , an economically deprived socialist stronghold. Le Pen polled 24.24% (10,228 votes) in the first round, qualifying for the run-off against socialist Jean-Claude Bois, in which Le Pen received 32.30% (12,266 votes); Bois was re-elected as the MP with 67.70% (27,510 votes). [ 244 ] Hénin-Beaumont in 2007 [ edit ] Marine Le Pen during a presidential rally in Lille , 25 February 2007 In the 2007 election , Le Pen and her substitute Steeve Briois [ clarification needed ] stood for the FN in the Pas-de-Calais' 14th constituency , Hénin-Beaumont, a former coal mining area with high unemployment. Le Pen expressed the view that due to unemployment, offshoring and insecurity, the constituency symbolised the major problems of France. [ 245 ] Le Pen's campaign committee was led by Daniel Janssens, who had previously served for 24 years as the socialist deputy mayor of Leforest . Le Pen finished second of fourteen candidates in the first round with 24.47% (10,593 votes), behind incumbent Socialist MP Albert Facon with 28.24% (12,221 votes). [ 246 ] Le Pen was the only FN candidate in France to qualify for the run-off. [ 247 ] After the first round, Le Pen was endorsed by Gaullist politicians Alain Griotteray and Michel Caldaguès and the souverainiste MEP Paul-Marie Coûteaux .

[ 251 ] According to political analysts, Le Pen's strong showing in the constituency was a result of economic and social issues like de-industrializaation, unemployment and a feeling of abandonment, rather than immigration or security.
