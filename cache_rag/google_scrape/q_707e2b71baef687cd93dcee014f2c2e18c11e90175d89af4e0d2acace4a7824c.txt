The match was turned twice: Argentina went into half-time with a 2–1 lead in spite of an early goal for Uruguay, but the hosts ultimately won 4–2.

The Netherlands had already played the previous final in West Germany 1974 - and also lost to the hosts. Diego Maradona was 17 years old at this point and already a star in his home country, but did not make the squad as coach César Luis Menotti felt he was too inexperienced to handle the pressure of this major tournament. The playmaker position was instead filled by Mario Kempes , who ended up becoming the first Argentinian to win the Golden Ball in addition to being the tournament's top scorer with 6 goals. The Dutch side was missing a superstar of their own: Johan Cruyff did not join the 1978 World Cup squads due to the aftermath of a kidnapping attempt which occurred in 1977. He only disclosed this information 30 years later. The closely contested match was influenced by a hostile atmosphere and ended with the Dutch players refusing to attend the award ceremony after Argentina grabbed the title in extra time. 25 June 1978 15:00 UTC−3 Argentina 3–1 ( a.e.t. ) Netherlands Kempes 38' , 105' Bertoni 115' Report Nanninga 82' Estadio Monumental , Buenos Aires Attendance: 71,483 Referee: Sergio Gonella ( Italy ) Argentina Netherlands GK 5 Ubaldo Fillol RB 15 Jorge Olguín CB 7 Luis Galván CB 19 Daniel Passarella ( c ) LB 20 Alberto Tarantini DM 6 Américo Gallego CM 2 Osvaldo Ardiles 40 ' 66 ' AM 10 Mario Kempes RW 4 Daniel Bertoni LW 16 Oscar Alberto Ortiz 75 ' CF 14 Leopoldo Luque Substitutes: MF 1 Norberto Alonso GK 3 Héctor Baley MF 8 Rubén Galván MF 9 René Houseman 75 ' MF 12 Omar Larrosa 93 ' 66 ' Manager: César Luis Menotti GK 8 Jan Jongbloed SW 5 Ruud Krol ( c ) 15 ' RB 6 Wim Jansen 75 ' CB 22 Ernie Brandts LB 2 Jan Poortvliet 96 ' RM 13 Johan Neeskens CM 9 Arie Haan LM 11 Willy van de Kerkhof RF 10 René van de Kerkhof CF 16 Johnny Rep 58 ' LF 12 Rob Rensenbrink Substitutes: DF 4 Adrie van Kraay DF 17 Wim Rijsbergen FW 18 Dick Nanninga 58 ' GK 19 Pim Doesburg DF 20 Wim Suurbier 94 ' 75 ' Manager: Ernst Happel 1986 v West Germany [ edit ] Eight years after the victory on home soil, Argentina won the World Cup title for the second time.

Against conferences [ edit ] FIFA delegates regional qualification and other organization affairs to continental conferences, so it divides into six differents of them grouped by geographical location. Argentina plays in CONMEBOL conference in South America . Due to World Cup rules that two teams of same confederation can not play in the same group in first round except for UEFA, it commonly faces teams which plays outside its continent most recently from Africa and Asia. Argentine national has never played versus an Oceanian ( OFC ) squad.

All won by Argentina by one goal difference. Most played semifinals without losses: 6 times won in 1930, 1986 and 2022 while drawn in 1990 and 2014. Although in 1978 there weren't semifinals, Argentina won second round group ahead of Brazil which disputed 3rd place match against Italy. Even more, game against Brazil ended in a 0–0 draw. Most played penalty shoot-outs: 7 (twice in 1990, 1998, 2006, 2014 and twice in 2022). Fewest goals for a finalist: 1990 (5). Youngest coach: Juan José Tramutola aged 27 years and 267 days in 1930. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Most hat-tricks scored in multiple editions: Gabriel Batistuta in 1994 against Greece and in 1998 against Jamaica. [ 9 ] Shared [ edit ] Most played against the same team: 7 times versus Germany in 1958, 1966, 1986, 1990, 2006, 2010 and 2014. Shared with Germany vs Yugoslavia/Serbia and Brazil vs Sweden .

[ 10 ] Shared with Italian Vittorio Pozzo (1934-1938), German Helmut Schön (1966-1974), Brazilian Mário Zagallo (1970-1998) German Franz Beckenbauer who faced Bilardo in both 1986 and 1990, and French Didier Deschamps (2018-2022). Miscellaneous [ edit ] Argentina's game versus West Germany in 1958 featured a yellow jersey instead of the traditional light blue and white colors or blue as alternate. This was because both teams wore white jerseys, creating confusion. As the South American side forgot to bring an alternate one, they decided to borrow jerseys from local team club Malmö. Germany won 3–1. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] In the 1978 France - Hungary match something similar occurred. Both teams arrived to the match with white jerseys, so France was forced to borrow jerseys from Mar del Plata 's local club Kimberley . France wore striped green and white keeping the traditional blue shorts and red socks. France won 3–1. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The stadium José María Minella is the southernmost World Cup venue located at 38°0′0″S 57°33′0″W ﻿ / ﻿ 38.00000°S 57.55000°W ﻿ / -38.00000; -57.55000 . Including France vs. Hungary, several matches of the 1978 World Cup were played in this stadium. Mar del Plata is in the south of Buenos Aires Province . [ 15 ] Referees [ edit ] As a major CONMEBOL member, Argentina has been represented by match officials in nearly every tournament. In 2006, Horacio Elizondo refereed the final between France and Italy , where he sent off Zinedine Zidane after a headbutt to an opponent. In 2018, Néstor Pitana did it when France played versus Croatia . They are also the only two who refereed the opening game in the same tournament.
