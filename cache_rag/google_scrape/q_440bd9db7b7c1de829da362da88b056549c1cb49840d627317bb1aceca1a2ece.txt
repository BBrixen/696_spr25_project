It still feels like a "recent" game, but as far as gaming goes, that's practically ancient. That also makes Breath of the Wild over four and a half years old. It brings to mind that we haven't heard anything about a sequel or new mainline Mario game, though. What are you all hoping for in the next Mario game? Odyssey 2? Sunshine 2? Something completely different? I feel as though Bowser's Fury was a (successful) test of some new gameplay directions and the next mainline Mario is going to build on that. I know it's a pipe dream but I'd love to see a return to either the Mario Land universe or the Sub-Con universe. I sort of imagine Mario going to Subcon to face Mouser, Triclyde, Wart, etc-- with some Dedede-like twist at the end. I know I'm showing my age, but that universe captured my imagination as a kid moreso than the original Mario universe. I thought Odyssey was the greatest Mario adventure to date, and while some of the moons were way too easy to get yes, the game was meant to be accessible to children, and the post-game content has some really rewarding challenge to it. I think they balanced it perfectly. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
