Bowser joined Nintendo in 2015 as Vice President of Sales, before being promoted to Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing the following year. He succeeded Reggie Fils-Aim√© as President in 2019. Because he shares his surname with Bowser [ 1 ] , the main antagonist of the Mario franchise (who has appeared with Metroid characters in Super Smash Bros. ), they appeared together during the Nintendo Direct at E3 2019, when Doug Bowser was introduced by Nintendo senior executive Yoshiaki Koizumi. In Japanese versions of the Nintendo Direct, it included a message that explained the underlying joke about the Doug Bowser and Bowser's appearance in the segment, due to Bowser being named "Koopa" in Japan and thus the joke being lost in translation otherwise. Prior to his work at Nintendo, Bowser worked as vice president of global demand planning at Electronic Arts (2007-2015) and director of customer marketing for Latin America at Procter & Gamble (1998-2004). Contents 1 Involvement with the Metroid series 1.1 Game Awards acceptance speech 2 Gallery 3 External links 4 References Involvement with the Metroid series [ ] During an interview with Polygon published on December 16, 2020, Bowser was asked for an update on Metroid Prime 4 , Bayonetta 3 or the sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild . He said: "You‚Äôve followed Nintendo long enough to know that as we progress on any title, and we deem it‚Äôs the right moment, we will share with the community where we are in the development. At this point, though, I have nothing more that I can share on those titles." [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Bowser spoke about Metroid Dread on the 40th episode of the Nintendo Power Podcast . He said that it would conclude the five-part story that began with the very first Metroid game, and discussed the new abilities in Dread , the two amiibo of Samus Aran and an E.M.M.I. and what they unlock, and the Special Edition. [ 4 ] On October 8, 2021, when Metroid Dread was released, Bowser tweeted a photo of his copy of the game on his Nintendo Switch . [ 5 ] He confirmed to The Verge on November 12, 2021 that Dread sold 854,000 units in the United States, making it the best launch for a Metroid title in that region. [ 6 ] At The Game Awards 2021, Bowser accepted the award for Best Action Adventure Game, which was given to Dread . [ 7 ] He had packed his copy of the game and Samus amiibo for his trip to the award show. [ 8 ] When Elon Musk asked on Twitter "What video games have you enjoyed most over past year or two?", Bowser responded Metroid Dread . [ 9 ] Upon meeting Venus Williams , he claimed she was a Metroid fan. [ 10 ] Game Awards acceptance speech [ ] ‚Äú On behalf of the teams at Nintendo and MercurySteam who worked on Metroid Dread, thank you so much for this award and congratulations to all the other nominees. This is the action-adventure category, and Metroid Dread checks off both the action and the adventure box. It's filled with action-packed moments behind every door , around every corner and on every level, and at the same time, it introduces us to a massive and mysterious new planet that players can explore and adventure through. It's the result of a true collaboration between Nintendo, and MercurySteam, and I have a few comments that the developers asked me to read on their behalf. We'd like to say a big thank you for this award, from the development teams at Nintendo and MercurySteam, that worked so hard to bring all the Metroid fans around the world the experience that they were hoping for. It's been a dream come true to travel together in this dangerous, yet marvelous journey to ZDR. We're so thankful for all the fans for enjoying Metroid Dread on Nintendo Switch. Thank you very much. ‚Äû ‚ÄîDoug Bowser Gallery [ ] Bowser's copy of Dread . Bowser's Samus amiibo.
