How did Montgomery come to host one of the most prestigious tournaments in the country? The answer lies in Montgomery’s “Mr. Tennis”– Jack Bushman. In 1949, Mr. Bushman, a Montgomery resident, was the President of the Southern Lawn Tennis Association. He wanted to tie-in a world class tennis tournament to the prestigious Blue Gray football classic. He envisioned starting an event similar to the world renowned Sugar Bowl junior tennis tournament that is played in conjunction with the Sugar Bowl football game. However, he decided the tournament should feature top college players rather than juniors. Mr. Bushman was the captain of his tennis team at Louisiana State University. His memories of the excitement and color of college tennis was no doubt rooted in his decision to feature college players. For the first 30 years, the Blue Gray tournament was an individual contest rather than the present day team competition. In the beginning, the tournament was held at The Montgomery Country Club. In 1969, the site was moved to Huntingdon College for a few years until it was moved to the present locations of Lagoon Park and O’Connor Tennis Centers. During this time of individual competition, many of the finest college players in the country came to Montgomery to play the Blue Gray. Many of these players went on to become some of the top professional players in the world. A brief list of names would include: Stan Smith, Tony Trabert, Barry McKay, Chuck McKinley, Charlie Pasarell, Tim and Tom Gullickson, Kevin Curren, Steve Denton and Vince Van Patten. The tournament continued to bring in top players such as exhibition matches by Pancho Gonzalez, Frankie Parker, Jack Kramer, and Bobby Riggs. In 1983, Mr. Bushman went to the NCAA Championships and approached top college coaches about the possibility of changing the event to a team competition. The coaches liked the idea of playing in a team tournament to prepare them for the season ending NCAA team championships. Thus, the tournament was reborn as a team event and remains so today. Since becoming a team sport, the top tennis programs in the country have played the Blue Gray. Storied tennis programs such as USC, Pepperdine, Notre Dame, Harvard, Illinois, Florida, Michigan, Georgia, as well as our local favorites Alabama and Auburn, have participated. Perhaps the most unique feature of the Blue Gray is the southern hospitality it offers. Tennis fans across Montgomery open up their homes and keep the players throughout the tournament. Life long friendships have developed between players and host families. Many of the players from the current era have gone on to great success in the professional ranks. Some of the more notable former Blue Gray players would include Paul Annacone, Mikael Pernfors, Richey Reneberg, Murphy and Luke Jensen, Mali Vai Washington and current stars – Mahesh Bhupathi and James Blake. In all, there have been seven Grand Slam (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open and Australian Open) single finalists and over thirty Grand Slam double champions that can trace their careers back to Montgomery and the Blue Gray. It is a unanimous consensus among college coaches that the Blue Gray National Collegiate Tennis Classic is one of the top tennis events in the country. Mr. Bushman’s legacy and his spirit live on in this great sporting event.

Initially Blue Gray was an individual tournament and grew to become a team tournament currently hosting 8 women’s teams and 8 men’s teams. The Blue Gray committee has witnessed athletes who played in Blue Gray early in their careers go on to expand their tennis careers and achieve honors in their athletic industry. Our consideration extends beyond players to include the coaches who, for some, have been bringing a talented team for over 30 years to play the Blue Gray National Tennis Classic. 2024 Inductee: Tim Puetz - Auburn Puetz joined the Tigers in the spring of 2008 and quickly climbed the national rankings.

Two years later, he won the 1949 Wimbledon singles championship. He was renowned for his great rages against opponents, officials, photographers, newsmen and even spectators. However, these fits only served to intensify his own play. "We hoped he wouldn't get upset; it just made him tougher," said Rod Laver of Gonzalez. Gonzales turned professional, joining Jack Kramer on a nationwide tour and consistently beat the best professionals around, including Lew Hoad, Ken Rosewall, Frank Sedgman, Segura, and Tony Trabert. The 6-3" Gonzales was especially noted for his great serve, which was once clocked at 112 mph. His last moment in the spotlight was in the 1969 Wimbledon tournament. The 41-year-old Gonzales beat 25-year-old former Blue Gray great, Charlie Pasarell, in a 112-game match that lasted 5 hours and 12 minutes, the longest in Wimbledon history.

Since 1959, Herren has been a club tennis director, state and Southern tennis administrator, and the head of Herron's of Birmingham, a company that builds tennis courts. He has been inducted into the Southern Tennis Association Hall of Fame, the Alabama Tennis Association Hall of Fame, and the Birmingham Southern Hall of Fame. Ron Holmberg - Tulane University Ron Holmberg was born January 27, 1938 in Brooklyn. He started playing tennis on the public courts and won the first tournament he entered at age 12. This started a love affair with tennis that continues to this day. In 1953, Ron won three out of the four possible U.S. National Junior titles. In 1956, he defeated Rod Laver in the junior finals of Wimbledon to be crowned “World Champion.” He played his collegiate tennis at Tulane University where he was a three-time All-American. Holmberg won the SEC singles championship three times and the NCAA doubles championship twice. Ron played in several Blue Gray events when it was an individual competition (as opposed to today’s team event). He captured back-to-back Blue Gray doubles titles in 1957 and 1958. In 1959, he broke through to win the singles championship. Ron has been selected to be a member of the U.S. Davis Cup Team three times. He was ranked in the “TOP TEN” of U.S. Men’s singles for a remarkable nine years. In 1971, after retiring from professional competition, Ron became the varsity tennis coach at West Point.

Luke and Murphy Jenson – USC and University of Georgia Luke went to USC and was an All-American in 1985 and in 1987. Murphy went to Georgia and he was an All-American in 1991. On the pro tour, the tennis establishment wasn’t quite ready for the brothers’ arrival in 1993 when, just six months into their professional careers, they pulled off a staggering coup: a French Open doubles win that catapulted them onto the global stage. And, among the raised eyebrows at the chest butts, high fives and self-expression of this new breed of rock ‘n’ roll tennis, the brothers built themselves a loyal following that persists to this day. Jack Kramer Kramer grew up in the Los Angeles area. He achieved international notice in 1939 as a teenager when he was selected to play doubles, alongside Joe Hunt, for the U.S. in the Davis Cup finale against Australia. At 18, Kramer was the youngest to play in the Cup title round. In 1940, Davis Cup Captain, Walter Pate, decided to let Ted Schroeder and Kramer do it all, controversial until the pals paralyzed the favored Aussies on opening day. Schroeder won in five over John Bromwich and Kramer nailed Dinny Pails, 8-6, 6-2, 9-7. Together they grabbed the Cup by flattening the team that had beaten Hunt and Kramer in '39. Because of the war, Kramer missed three years of tennis. He returned to the game with a vengeance taking the US title in Forrest Hills in 1946 and 1947. He also took the Wimbledon title in 1947, a tournament where he also won the doubles crown in ’46 and ’47. One of the shrewdest operators in tennis, Kramer was looked to for advice when the open era began in 1968. In 1972 he was instrumental in forming the Association of Tennis Pros, the male players' union, and was its first executive director. Kramer, winner of 13 U.S. singles and doubles titles, was named to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1968. Rich Leach – University of Southern California Leach became the first four-time Division 1 All American in singles and doubles at USC, where he played for his father, Dick, and won the NCAA doubles title in 1986 and 1987. As a professional, he became a doubles specialist, and won 5 Grand Slam men's doubles titles (3 Australian Open, 1 Wimbledon, and 1 USOpen), and 4 Grand Slam mixed doubles titles (2 Australian Open, 1 Wimbledon, 1 US Open). Leach reached the World No. 1 doubles ranking in 1990. Leach was a member of the US team which won the Davis Cup in 1990. Partnering Jim Pugh, he won the doubles rubbers in all four of the rounds which the US played in that year, and clinched the team's victory in the final with a win over Pat Cash and John Fitzgerald of Australia. Dani Leal – Pepperdine / Auburn University Montgomery Leal played for Pepperdine University for three years where he was a two-time All-American. He earned a top 10 National singles ranking in NCAA and led his team to runner up in the NCAA competition. In 1999, Dani went back to AUM to finish his degree and play tennis. At AUM, he again led his team to a #2 National ranking. Leal was a finalist in doubles at the Nationals and made it to the round of 16 in singles, earning him All-American status once again.

Barry MacKay now provides color commentary, play-by-play and lead analysis for The Tennis Channel's coverage of the top tennis tournaments in the world. MacKay is an accomplished, versatile broadcaster with 30 years of experience off the court that has teamed him with Arthur Ashe, Bud Collins, Beth Herr, Leif Shiras, among others, and made him the voice U.S. fans tuned to for events such as the US Open, Wimbledon and ATP tennis. Chuck McKinley - Trinity University McKinley was a short, stubby Missourian. At the YMCA in St. Louis, he was a star in ping-pong and tennis. While at Trinity, he was favored to win the U.S. Intercollegiate title in 1963. However, he obtained permission from the college president to go for the larger prize, Wimbledon. Seeded fourth, McKinley went through the draw without losing a set to take the title. Later, McKinley was more intent on getting a college degree and establishing himself in business than having a long career in tennis. McKinley resisted professional offers, and his career was relatively brief. He was ranked seven successive years in the U.S. Top Ten from 1960, No. 1 in 1962 and 1963, and four times in the World Top Ten from 1961, No. 2 in 1963. The great McKinley died tragically of a brain tumor shortly after learning, in 1986, that he had been named to the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Wesley Moodie – Auburn University Montgomery / Boise State University Moodie played two years at AUM from 1997-98 before transferring to Boise State, where he played for two years from 1999-2000. He earned collegiate All-American honors all four years of college - twice at each school... Led Boise State to Big West conference title and finished No. 4 in doubles rankings in 1999 as a junior and reached the NCAA semifinals. Moodie teamed with Stephen Huss (former Auburn and Blue Gray star) in 2005 to capture the doubles title at Wimbledon. Frankie Parker Parker was a marvelous groundstroker, particularly on the backhand side, and a paragon of durability. He was ranked in the U.S. Top 10, 17 straight years (1933-49), a male record until Jimmy Connors surpassed it in 1988. He was ranked number one in the United States in 1933, 1944 and 1945. He was the oldest ever to play in the US Open at 52 in 1968. He entered in 1968 for fun, this man who had teamed with Don Budge and Gene Mako to win the Davis Cup for the U.S. in 1937, saying he wanted to be part of yet another era, the "open." He lost his first match to eventual champion, Arthur Ashe, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. This completed a championship career that began with a third-round defeat in 1932. In between, Sgt. Parker won the U.S. title on his 13th try in 1944, again in 1945, both while on leave from the U.S. Army Air Force during World War II. Parker won 12 of 14 Davis Cup matches. In 1948 he won both singles in the successful defense against Australia. He was ranked in the World Top 10 six times between 1937 and 1949, and no. 1 in 1948. He entered the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1966. Charlie Pasarell - UCLA Pasarell was a three time All American at UCLA in 1963,1964 and 1966. He was the roommate of Arthur Ashe while at UCLA. Despite being the number-one-ranked American in 1967 and a world-class player for 15 years, Pasarell is far better known for one loss than any of his many victories. At Wimbledon in 1969 in his prime at 25, Pasarell was matched against 41 year old great - Pancho Gonzalez. The match became the longest in Wimbledon history, played over two days, the 5-hour, 12-minute struggle was won by Gonzalez, 22-24, 1-6, 16-14, 6-3, 11-9.

During Patton’s tenure he has led Boise State to 16 NCAA Tournament appearances, 14 conference tournament titles in four different leagues and an overall record of 448-199.

They went on tour and Riggs won 24 matches to 22 for Budge. Again in 1947 they met in the final of the Pro Championships and Riggs won in five long sets. Years later, in 1973, after fading into virtual obscurity as a senior player who would make a bet on the drop of a hat, Riggs was back, taking on first Margaret Court and then Billie Jean King in the Battle of the Sexes. He defeated Court, but King made him look old and slow in a 6-4, 6-4, 6-3, win before a record tennis crowd of 30,472, at Houston's Astrodome.
