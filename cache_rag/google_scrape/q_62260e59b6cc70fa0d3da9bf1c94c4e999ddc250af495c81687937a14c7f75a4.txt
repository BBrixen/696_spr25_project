In Maine, two of four electoral votes go to the statewide winner and one electoral vote goes to the winner in each of the two congressional districts. In Nebraska, two of five electoral votes go to the winner of the statewide vote. One electoral vote goes to the winner in each of Nebraska's three congressional districts. ; Search US Crime + Justice Energy + Environment Extreme Weather Space + Science World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe Middle East India UK Politics 2020 Election Facts First Election 101 Business Markets Tech Media Success Perspectives Video Opinion Political Op-Eds Social Commentary Health Food Fitness Wellness Parenting Live Longer Entertainment Stars Screen Binge Culture Media Tech Innovate Gadget Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Upstarts Business Evolved Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Pro Football College Football Basketball Baseball Soccer Olympics Video Live TV Digital Studios CNN Films HLN TV Schedule TV Shows A-Z CNNVR Coupons CNN Underscored -Explore -Wellness -Gadgets -Lifestyle CNN Store More… Photos Longform Investigations CNN profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Follow CNN Politics Terms of Use Privacy Policy Accessibility & CC AdChoices About us CNN Studio Tours CNN Store Newsletters Transcripts License Footage CNN Newsource © 2020 Cable News Network.
