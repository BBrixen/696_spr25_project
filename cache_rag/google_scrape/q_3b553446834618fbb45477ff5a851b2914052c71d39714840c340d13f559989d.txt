[ 128 ] He finished his year with 67 wins, surpassing his previous best of 63 wins in 2021. 2024: Australian final, 350th career win [ edit ] See also: 2024 Daniil Medvedev tennis season Medvedev began his season at the Australian Open , where he defeated Emil Ruusuvuori in the second round from two sets down and recorded the third-latest match finish in the history of this Major at 3:39 a.m. [ 129 ] He then defeated Félix Auger-Aliassime and Nuno Borges to reach the quarterfinals. He then won back-to-back 5-set matches against Hubert Hurkacz and Alexander Zverev , coming back from two sets down to defeat the latter, to reach his third Australian Open final. [ 130 ] He lost the final to Jannik Sinner in five sets, having led by two sets to love. [ 131 ] It was his second loss in an Australian Open final after having led by two sets to love, following his loss in the 2022 Australian Open final to Rafael Nadal , [ 132 ] becoming the only man in the Open Era to lose two Grand Slam finals from a two-set lead. By the end of the tournament, Medvedev had played four five-set matches in total and set two records: the most time spent on court at a Grand Slam tournament (24 hours and 17 minutes) and the most number of sets played in a singles major (31 sets). [ 133 ] At Indian Wells , Medvedev reached the final and lost to Carlos Alcaraz in a rematch of the previous year's final. At the Miami Open , he defeated Dominik Koepfer to reach the quarterfinals and recorded his 350th career win, becoming only the fourth man born in the 1990s or later to reach this milestone, after Dimitrov, Zverev and Raonic. [ 134 ] By reaching the quarterfinals at the Madrid Open the following month, he became the first player born in the 1990s or later to complete the career set of both Grand Slam and Masters 1000 quarterfinals [ 135 ] and the tenth active player overall. [ 136 ] As the defending champion at the Italian Open , Medvedev recorded his 100th Masters win over Jack Draper to reach the third round. [ 137 ] At the French Open , Medvedev defeated Dominik Koepfer in the first round, Miomir Kecmanović in the second round, and Tomáš Macháč in the third round. In the fourth round, he lost to Alex de Minaur in four sets. [ 138 ] At Wimbledon , he was seeded 5th and reached the semifinals, including a quarterfinal victory over World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in five sets. In the semifinals, he won the first set against defending champion and No. 3 seed Carlos Alcaraz before losing the next three sets. [ citation needed ] At the US Open in the quarterfinals, he lost in four sets to Jannik Sinner, who got his revenge for his previous loss against him, setting their head to head to 7-6. At the Asian Swing, he reached the semi finals of Beijing and the quarterfinals of Shanghai respectively, losing to Alcaraz and Sinner. After a second round defeat to Alexi Popyrin at Paris, he lost in the Round Robin stage of the ATP Finals. He ended the year ranked number 5. [ 139 ] 2025: 300th hardcourt win [ edit ] Medvedev started his season at the 2025 Australian Open where he overcame wildcard Kasidit Samrej in five sets despite being two sets-to-one down. He was then defeated by 19-year-old Learner Tien in five sets, losing two of three tiebreak sets. [ 140 ] He next participated in Rotterdam , beating Stan Wawrinka in three sets but losing in the second round to qualifier Mattia Bellucci . [ 141 ] At the 2025 Qatar ExxonMobil Open , Medvedev reached the quarterfinals, recording his 300th hardcourt win over Zizou Bergs , the second man born in 1990 or later to reach that milestone, after Grigor Dimitrov . [ 142 ] Medvedev then played in the first two Masters events of the year, the Indian Wells Open and Miami Open , losing to Holger Rune and Jaume Munar in the semifinals and second round, respectively. As he was not able to defend his last year's final and semifinal points, Medvedev dropped out of the Top 10 for the first time since 2023 to No. 11. Rivalries [ edit ] See also: List of tennis rivalries Stefanos Tsitsipas [ edit ] Main article: Medvedev–Tsitsipas rivalry Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas have faced each other 13 times since 2018, with Medvedev leading the rivalry, 9–4. Medvedev won his first five matches against Tsitsipas, but Tsitsipas has won four of their last seven. [ 143 ] They have a heated rivalry on-court, but their matches showcase antagonism between the two players on a personal level as well. Alexander Zverev [ edit ] Main article: Medvedev–Zverev rivalry Medvedev and Zverev have faced each other 19 times with Medvedev leading the rivalry 12–7. Zverev won the first four matches of their rivalry, but Medvedev won eleven of the last thirteen of their encounters. [ 144 ] Jannik Sinner [ edit ] Daniil Medvedev and Jannik Sinner have faced each other 15 times since 2020 with Sinner leading the rivalry 8–7. Medvedev won their first 6 matches including the 2023 Miami Open final but Sinner turned around the lopsided head to head in Beijing beating Medvedev for the first time. Since then Sinner has won 7 of their last 8 encounters including their most notable match at the 2024 Australian Open final which Sinner won to claim his first major title. Medvedev lost the final after leading 2 sets to love for the second time at the Australian Open, after the 2022 final against Rafael Nadal. Nadal and Djokovic [ edit ] Of his six major finals, Medvedev has twice faced Rafael Nadal (at the 2019 US Open and 2022 Australian Open ) and thrice faced Novak Djokovic (at 2021 Australian Open , 2021 US Open , and 2023 US Open ). His lone victory in major finals came at the 2021 US Open, where he defeated Djokovic in straight sets to win his first major title and deny Djokovic the Calendar Grand Slam . The following year, at the 2022 Australian Open , he was aiming to become the first man in the Open Era to win his second major title directly after the first, but lost to Nadal in an epic five-set match despite being two sets up. Overall, Medvedev's head-to-head against the two all-time greats is 1–5 against Nadal, and 5–10 against Djokovic. Playing style [ edit ] Medvedev is a counterpuncher. Standing at 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in) tall, he has a very powerful first serve capable of reaching 148 mph (238 km/h). He hits long, flat groundstrokes, often wearing opponents down with lengthy baseline rallies. Medvedev's biggest weapon is his ability to play consistently. He has not thrived on power and spin but has been able to land the ball between the lines over and over again. [ 145 ] Medvedev is also known for his strong return of serve. He tends to adopt a very deep position at the back of the court which allows him to hit full-swing groundstrokes rather than blocking the serve back into play. [ 146 ] He also possesses one of the best backhands on tour. His forehand is generally the weaker shot of the two. He is known for his very defensive play. Medvedev is a moderately strong competitor mentally, evident in his attitude on the court, playing style, and demeanor in big matches. [ 145 ] Initially possessing a short temper, Medvedev eventually learned to control himself and display a calm demeanor in important matches. According to Francisca Dauzet, the performance coach he has been working with since 2018, he has "monstrous mental potential" and is learning to control his impatience. He has at times been "unable to channel his outbursts", but Dauzet describes him as a quick learner who is "fast at catching things". [ 147 ] Medvedev's preferred surface is hardcourt and he has been one of the best and most consistent players on the surface since he first broke through to the top 10 in 2019. He has shown to be highly antagonistic towards clay, where he struggles the most. Medvedev suffers on clay due to his style of playing flat strokes and the fact that his movement, one of his biggest strengths on a hardcourt, is hampered. Medvedev himself claimed that he dislikes clay because it makes surrounding areas dirty. In 2021, during a match against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina , Medvedev ranted, "I don't want to play here on this surface!" and "This surface is for losers." Over time, Medvedev managed to get more comfortable with clay and adjust to the surface. He has since achieved solid results on the surface including a Masters title at the 2023 Italian Open . With his playing style, Novak Djokovic has described Medvedev as a very complete player and in October 2019 Alexander Zverev called him the best player in the world. 2019 ATP Finals champion, Stefanos Tsitsipas , once described his way of playing as "very boring"; but later said "he just plays extremely smart and outplays you". [ 148 ] [ 149 ] [ 150 ] [ 151 ] Medvedev has sometimes had an antagonistic relationship with crowds. At the 2021 US Open (which he won) and 2022 Australian Open, Medvedev was frequently booed and antagonized by the home crowd. At the 2023 US Open, Medvedev lashed out at the crowd, asking if they were "stupid" and asking them to "shut up." [ 152 ] Endorsements [ edit ] Medvedev endorses Lacoste for apparel and shoes, Tecnifibre for racquets, and Bovet for watches. He also has been employed as an ambassador by BMW , Tinkoff Bank , and HyperX for gaming accessories, mostly for the Russian-speaking world. He previously endorsed Lotto for apparel and shoes until 2019. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] Since November 2021, he has been signed as a promoter of the Guojiao 1573 brand.
