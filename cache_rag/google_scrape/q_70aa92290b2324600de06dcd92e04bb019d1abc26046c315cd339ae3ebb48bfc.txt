The award is presented by David McDermott Lexus of New Haven. Boise State junior running back Ashton Jeanty , Colorado State graduate wide receiver Tory Horton and UNLV senior wide receiver Ricky White III represent the Mountain West on the list. The MW’s three selections are tied for fifth-most among FBS conferences, trailing only the SEC, Big 12, Big Ten and ACC. Earlier in the summer, the Foundation announced its 2024 preseason All-American teams. The Walter Camp is the nation’s oldest and most prestigious All-America team. The 2024 Player of Year watch list will be narrowed to 10 semifinalists in early November and three finalists will be announced on Nov. 26. The 2024 Walter Camp Player of the Year recipient, which is voted on by the 133 NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision head coaches and sports information directors, will be announced on ESPN’s College Football Awards Show on Dec. 12. Appearing on the preseason Watch List is not a requirement for a player to win the Walter Camp award or be named to the All-America team.
