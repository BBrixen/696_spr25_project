The History of Tesla's Board of Directors Tesla's Board of Directors has evolved over time to reflect changes in the company's needs and growth trajectory. In 2004, when the company was founded, Elon Musk was the only member of the board. In the early years, Musk served as CEO, Chairman of the Board, and Chief Product Architect. In 2008, Tesla's Board of Directors expanded to include prominent venture capitalists and technology executives, reflecting the company's growth and maturation.
