NBC will air the awards live Sunday at 8 PM ET/5 PM PT at the Beverly Hilton, with Ricky Gervais returning to host. The ceremony will be followed by a slew of post-show parties from film and TV companies and agencies scattered throughout the hotel and beyond. Here is a listing of the major Globes-centric events leading up to and immediately after the show, which launches a wild January awards-season schedule (as in, you might want to save one of those bottles of champagne for later).
