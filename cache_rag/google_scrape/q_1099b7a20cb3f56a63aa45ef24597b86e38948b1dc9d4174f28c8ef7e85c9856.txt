Early life [ edit ] Koltsov was born on April 17, 1981, in Minsk , Byelorussian SSR , USSR (present-day Belarus ). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] He was raised there and at an early age pursued a dream to become a professional hockey player. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] He was born to Alexander and Natalia Koltsov. Playing career [ edit ] Koltsov started playing for Junactva Minsk in the Belarusian 1st division during the 1997–98 season and moved to the Russian team Severstal Cherepovets for the next season. [ 3 ] Due to his speed and stick handling, he was often referred to as the "Russian Rocket II" because of his similar playing style to that of Russian great Pavel Bure . [ 3 ] Koltsov was drafted to the NHL in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft as the Pittsburgh Penguins ' first round pick, 18th overall. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] He played for the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins in the AHL in the 2002–03 season and started playing full-time for the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2003–04 season, playing 82 games and scoring nine goals and 20  assists. [ 6 ] During the 2004–05 NHL lockout , Koltsov played for the Spartak Moscow hockey team, scoring six goals in 31 games. [ 3 ] [ 7 ] The following season, Koltsov moved between Wilkes-Barre and Pittsburgh until January, after which he stayed in the NHL until the end of the season, finishing with three goals and six assists. [ 3 ] As a result of the Penguins not extending a qualifying offer, Koltsov became an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2006. [ 3 ] In August 2006, he returned to Russia, signing to play for Salavat Yulaev Ufa of the Russian Super League . [ 3 ] During the 2007–08 RSL season, Koltsov was part of a Salavat Yulaev Ufa squad that defeated Lokomotiv Yaroslavl to capture the RSL league title. [ 3 ] With the absorption of the RSL into the newly formed Kontinental Hockey League at the start of the 2008–09 season, Salavat Yulaev Ufa would become the last standing RSL champion. [ 3 ] [ 8 ] With Salavat Yulaev Ufa, Koltsov won the Gagarin Cup throughout the 2010–11 season. [ 9 ] On November 27, 2016, Koltsov retired from professional hockey after competing for 18 seasons. [ 10 ] He became an assistant for the Belarusian men's hockey team and also worked as the assistant coach of Salavat Yulaev Ufa , where he served for two seasons prior to his death. [ 9 ] International play [ edit ] Internationally, Koltsov played on the Belarus national team in the Winter Olympics and IIHF World Championships . [ 4 ] Personal life and death [ edit ] Koltsov had three children with his former wife, Julia. They divorced in 2020. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] He began publicly dating Belarusian tennis player Aryna Sabalenka in June 2021. [ 13 ] Koltsov and Sabalenka were separated at the time of his death. [ 14 ] Koltsov's former club Salavat Yulaev announced his death on March 18, 2024. He was 42.
