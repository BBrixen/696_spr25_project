Let’s see if wang can bounce back here and win at least two or three games. NaomiKonjuhPotapova G.O.A.T. Sep 3, 2019 #1,902 ACE of Hearts said: I don’t think wang is that good. Her grand slam results speak for themselves. Click to expand... She's good at delivering bagel tho. Beating Mladenovic and Ostapenko 0 & 0, Muguruza 2 & 0.

Serena had 13 winners, Wang had 0. Serena's won 92% of her 1st serve points. Wang won 33% of hers. THUNDERVOLLEY G.O.A.T. Sep 3, 2019 #1,907 Tennis clinic as much as any match could be, but its not over yet. Win or lose, Wang's benefit is that she will learn from this experience, as she played the first set as if she's never encountered that kind of game before.

She’s probably used to it by now Reactions: Tanya and AM75 AM75 Hall of Fame Sep 3, 2019 #1,914 If Serena wins this USO I hope she'll get her 25th in Australia, and the organisers of AO would make Court give Serena a trophy. That might be so funny. Reactions: Soianka , Service Ace and SeeingDusk NoleFam Bionic Poster Sep 3, 2019 #1,915 Serena is lethal tonight.  She might be finally getting ready to grab that elusive 24th Slam.

Probably Naomi but they haven't met that much. M Midaso240 Legend Sep 3, 2019 #1,922 Damn,looks like it's just down to Svitolina,Andreescu,Mertens,Bencic or Vekic to save tennis... ACE of Hearts Bionic Poster Sep 3, 2019 #1,923 Wang is terrible! I can see why she never made it past the 3rd round in a slam until this us open. NaomiKonjuhPotapova G.O.A.T.

Click to expand... Yeah this is all part of pattern. She played excellent QF and SF at W too. So, I guess she’ll finish slaughtering wang, then get at Svitolina, then crumble against Andreescu or Bencic. NaomiKonjuhPotapova G.O.A.T.

I just checked some, probably Hingis. But she quit the game super early. ACE of Hearts Bionic Poster Sep 3, 2019 #1,931 I wanna see a damn bagel!!!! Serena might be too nice and give her a game.

Yea she can't seem to cross the final hurdle anymore.  That may be getting ready to change though. ACE of Hearts Bionic Poster Sep 3, 2019 #1,933 skyline said: Yeah this is all part of pattern.

Could be a good match but who knows. Can’t trust svitolina. Reactions: JadeC and Tanya TennisLBC Professional Sep 3, 2019 #1,934 Why aren't Serena opponents simply hitting drop shots and moving her side to side? Isn't that the TTW formula? Reactions: flyingboris , DariusD , Service Ace and 1 other person T TrojanTennis New User Sep 3, 2019 #1,935 What a boring match to watch. A compete beat down. Serena should play in the men’s draw. She’s too strong physically for the female draw. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk ACE of Hearts Bionic Poster Sep 3, 2019 #1,936 Lol. This is about as embarrassing as it gets. Wang might want to leave the court quickly. Lozo1016 Hall of Fame Sep 3, 2019 #1,937 Serena hasn't played Svitolina since Elina knocked her out of the Olympics. Serena's struggled mightily with her 2nd serve and she had a tough time with Elina's 1st serve. NoleFam Bionic Poster Sep 3, 2019 #1,938 Midaso240 said: Andreescu? Williams was getting trashed so bad in Rogers Cup that she had to retire Click to expand... Wasn't it like 3-1 in the 1st set?  The match was basically just beginning.

Reactions: TennisLBC JadeC Hall of Fame Sep 3, 2019 #1,945 Wang was never going to be a threat to Serena. At least the match is going fast so we can get the Fed/Dimi match.

Sep 3, 2019 #1,948 Have to say I find the other forum's nickname Basiclina to be very funny. Although she's in the semis now which isn't so funny.
