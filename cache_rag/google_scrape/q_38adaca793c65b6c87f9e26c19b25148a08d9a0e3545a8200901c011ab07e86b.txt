"It's also one of the few awards that I think that 'Marriage Story' is going to win. But Laura Dern has never won an Oscar. This will be her first time. Everyone loves her. I think this is her time." Laura Dern in a scene from the 2019 film, "Marriage Story." Netflix MORE: Joaquin Phoenix on the making of 'Joker' BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR: TOM HANKS, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood ANTHONY HOPKINS, The Two Popes AL PACINO, The Irishman JOE PESCI, The Irishman BRAD PITT, Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood FAVORITE: BRAD PITT "If it was me saying come up for the gold, it would be Joe Pesci," said Travers. "That performance is amazing. And Pesci won his first Oscar for another Scorsese movie 'Goodfellas,' where he was the most scary gangster you could see. But the Academy is giving this award. And no one, no one can win this except Brad Pitt. These other people here, all have won Oscars. Do you realize in his full career, Brad Pitt has never won an [acting] Academy Award? Game over people." Brad Pitt in "Once Upon A Time In Hollywood". Sony Pictures MORE: How to watch Oscar-nominated films from home BEST ACTRESS: CYNTHIA ERIVO, Harriet SCARLETT JOHANSSON, Marriage Story SAOIRSE RONAN, Little Women CHARLIZE THERON, Bombshell RENEE ZELLWEGER, Judy FAVORITE: RENEE ZELLWEGER Travers said, "I would give this award personally to Saoirse Ronan just because to be that young and to be that consistently brilliant is amazing. But it's Renee's. Not only will Renee Zellweger win for best actress. But she will win for the Oscar that Judy Garland never had." Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland in the 2019 film "Judy." LD Entertainment and Roadside Attractions MORE: Adam Driver talks 'Marriage Story,' 'The Report' and 'Star Wars' BEST ACTOR: ANTONIO BANDERAS, Pain and Glory LEONARDO DICAPRIO, Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood ADAM DRIVER, Marriage Story JOAQUIN PHOENIX, Joker JONATHAN PRYCE, The Two Popes FAVORITE: JOAQUIN PHOENIX "I've had this feeling that this was Adam Driver's to lose. That performance in 'Marriage Story' is one of the best things he's ever done or that I've seen this year. And yet, there's that other guy. And who's that other guy? He's Joaquin Phoenix playing Joker. Sometimes there's that kind of performance, sometimes there's one that just so dominates the screen, that it's such an act of immersion from an actor in a role. Joaquin has been nominated several times before and never won. Joaquin, this is yours." Joaquin Phoenix stars in the 2019 film, "Joker." Warner Bros. MORE: Joaquin Phoenix on the making of 'Joker' BEST DIRECTOR: MARTIN SCORSESE, The Irishman QUENTIN TARANTINO , Once Upon a Time in Hollywood SAM MENDES, 1917 BONG JOON-HO, Parasite TODD PHILLIPS, Joker FAVORITE: SAM MENDES "Every one of these guys you can make a case for," Travers said, adding that the category will go to one of two directors. "One of them being the South Korean director Bong Joon-Ho for 'Parasite,' a foreign language film that seems to have gotten everybody excited for what's possible. And then Sam Mendes for '1917,' a World War I movie that was constructed to look like it was done in one continuous take. It's going to be for Sam Mendes for creating a war movie like no war movie we've ever seen before." Director Sam Mendes speaks with actors George McKay and Dean-Charles Chapman on the set of the 2019 film, "1917."

"I think 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' being a love letter to Hollywood and being voted on by people who live and work in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino has never won a best picture Oscar or a best director Oscar. Never. What better time than now when he's saying, 'Hollywood I love you'? I think it's time for Hollywood to say to Quentin Tarantino, 'I love you back."
