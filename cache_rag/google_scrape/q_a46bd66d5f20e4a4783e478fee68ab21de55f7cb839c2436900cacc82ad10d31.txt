Members Online • REQ52767 Grateful that Joss Whedon did not direct Infinity War or Endgame. Discussion Let me say off the top that I love Avengers and I think Age of Ultron was pretty good, but I’m grateful that Joss Whedon left the MCU in 2015. I just finished watching Zach Snyder’s Justice League recently and wow (regardless of your thoughts on that film) it is clear that Joss Whedon butchered it in 2017. Besides Coulson’s death scene, I don’t see evidence that he can tell a superhero story that has continuous gravitas. I have no doubt that, in a Joss Whedon written version, Infinity War’s ending and the beginning of Endgame would have been filled with ill-fitting jokes. Additionally, the sense of dread that is felt throughout Infinity War would have been undercut with Whedon’s humor and directing style. I also think that Joss Whedon’s writing skills are limited so he would have failed to juggle all the characters. I think some of the characters would have become one-dimensional with their only notable trait being quirky one-liners. Also, it has become clear that he is not really a good person outside of the movies, but putting that aside. Despite making 1 great Avengers film and 1 enjoyable Avengers film, I don’t think the MCU would have stuck the Infinity Saga’s landing with Joss Whedon at the helm. What do you all think?
