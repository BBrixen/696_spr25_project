They have secured the top spot for the first time. Disney ends up right behind with 23, between the studio’s 10 noms, six each for 20th Century Fox and Searchlight, and another for Disney-owned National Geographic’s The Cave . Disney, by the way, had 17 noms last year, with Fox Searchlight turning in that number also. As for the rest of the distribution field, Sony Pictures had a strong showing of 20 noms spread across Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood, Little Women , Sony Pictures Classics’ Pain and Glory and Sony Pictures Animation’s animated short Hair Love . They are followed by 16 between Universal Pictures and its arthouse label Focus Features mostly for 1917 ; with Focus pitching in a pair for Harriet including Best Actress for Cynthia Erivo; Warner Bros notched 12, mainly for the disruptive overachiever Joker . Upstart distributor Neon scored with eight nominations for its Bong Joon Ho-directed Parasite , with a pair for Judy distributor Roadside Attractions and LD Entertainment also with two.
