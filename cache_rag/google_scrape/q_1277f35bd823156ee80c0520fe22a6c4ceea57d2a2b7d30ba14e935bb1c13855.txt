Members Online • InAbsentiaC newb Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Expansion Pass question Xenoblade 2 Hi All, I picked up XC2 around the time it came out, put 40 hours into it, and then dropped it because I felt overwhelmed by the systems and didn't have the time I needed to devote to it. After seeing positive reviews for XC1 DE, I decided to break out XC2 again and beat it. I figure I can't really justify buying another XC game if I don't beat the one I already have. After watching some Youtube vids to get me back up to speed, I realized there is a great DLC deal that includes Torna plus a bunch of items that will probably come in handy early game. Since I have some Nintendo eShop credit, I'm seriously tempted to pick it up. The only problem is that I'm already 3/4s of the way through Chapter 3 and I'm a bit confused about how the DLC delivery works. Will it be pretty obvious where I can pick up rare blades that are available early game? Or will I need to look it up? And will I miss anything that would normally show up in the first couple of chapters? I'm guessing I can do side quests any time, but is it easy to identify the DLC side quest content? Instead of trying to do all of the side quests as I come across them, like I did the first time around, I'm basically completing one or two each chapter and moving on with the main story. I remember liking the game a lot more by the end of Chapters 3 and 4, but it took me forever to get there and I think it's because I did too much exploring on virtually every map. And I tried to discover everything I could before moving forward. No wonder I burned out. But will I be able to go back and play the stuff I missed later? Or in NG+? Thanks in advance for helping a newb out who has limited gaming time. I'm really loving this game and just want to make sure I'm not shooting myself in the foot by getting the expansion pass this "late" in the game. Read more New to Reddit?
