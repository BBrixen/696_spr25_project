Elon Musk in 2022
Elon Musk
is the
wealthiest person in the world
, with an estimated
net worth
of US$301 billion as of March 10, 2025, according to the
Bloomberg Billionaires Index
,
[
1
]
and $320 billion according to
Forbes
,
[
2
]
primarily from his ownership stakes in
Tesla
and
SpaceX
.
[
3
]
Having been first listed on the
Forbes Billionaires List
in 2012,
[
4
]
around 75% of Musk's wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020.
[
5
]
Describing himself as "
cash poor
",
[
6
]
[
7
]
a year later, he became the first person in the world to have a net worth above $300 billion. By December 2024, he became the first person to reach a net worth of $400 billion.

History
[
edit
]
Elon Musk made $175.8 million when
PayPal
was sold to
eBay
in October 2002.
[
9
]
He was first listed on the
Forbes Billionaires List
in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.
[
4
]
Musk paid $455 million in taxes on $1.52 billion of income between 2014 and 2018.
[
10
]
According to
ProPublica
, Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018.
[
11
]
He stated his 2021 tax bill was estimated at $12 billion based on his sale of $14 billion worth of Tesla stock.
[
10
]
Musk has repeatedly described himself as "
cash poor
",
[
6
]
[
7
]
and has "professed to have little interest in the material trappings of wealth".
[
6
]
In May 2020, he pledged to sell almost all physical possessions.
[
7
]
Musk has defended his wealth by saying he is accumulating resources for
humanity's outward expansion to space
.
[
12
]
At the start of 2020, Elon Musk had a net worth of $27 billion.
[
13
]
By the end of the year his net worth had increased by $150 billion, mostly driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock.
[
14
]
During this period, Musk's net worth was often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion on September 8, the largest single-day plunge in
Bloomberg Billionaires Index
'
s
history at the time.
[
15
]
In November of that year, Musk passed Facebook co-founder
Mark Zuckerberg
to become the third-richest person in the world; a week later he passed
Microsoft
co-founder
Bill Gates
to become the second-richest.
[
5
]
In January 2021, Musk, with a net worth of $185 billion, surpassed
Amazon
founder
Jeff Bezos
to become the richest person in the world.
[
16
]
Bezos reclaimed the top spot the following month.
[
17
]
On September 27, 2021, after Tesla stock surged, Forbes announced that Musk had a net worth of over $200 billion,
[
18
]
and was the richest person in the world. In November 2021, Musk became the first person to have a net worth of more than $300 billion.
[
19
]
On December 30, 2022, due to declining stock values in Tesla, Musk had lost $200 billion from his net worth, the first person in history to do so,
[
20
]
[
21
]
which was recognized by
Guinness World Records
in January 2023.
[
22
]
Musk's net worth surged after the
2024 United States presidential election
, and in December 2024, he became the first person to have a net worth of more than $400 billion.
[
8
]
A primary customer, the
federal government of the United States
has signed contracts worth $20 billion with SpaceX as of November 2024
[update]
.
[
23
]
Musk's association with the
Trump administration
received backlash, resulting in his net worth dropping by $126 billion between December 2024 and March 2025.
[
24
]
Sources of wealth
[
edit
]
Around 75% of Musk's wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020,
[
5
]
a proportion that fell to about 37% as of December 2022,
[
a
]
after selling nearly $40 billion in company shares since late 2021.
[
25
]
Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed with the board in 2018 to a compensation plan that ties his personal earnings to Tesla's valuation and revenue.
[
14
]
The deal stipulated that Musk only received the compensation if Tesla reached certain market values.
[
26
]
It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and a company board.
[
27
]
In the first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69 million Tesla shares (about 1% of the company) at below-market prices, which was worth about $800 million.
[
27
]
[
26
]
In January 2024, Delaware Judge
Kathaleen McCormick
ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk's $55 billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded.
[
28
]
McCormick called the compensation granted by the company's board "an unfathomable sum" that was unfair to shareholders. In response to the ruling, Musk posted on X: "Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware."
[
29
]
A re-ratification shareholders' vote passed in mid-June 2024, although much follow-up litigation is expected, including a lawsuit filed by a Tesla investor beforehand that alleged Musk employed "coercive tactics" to move the vote in his favor.
[
30
]
Management
[
edit
]
Musk's wealth is managed by his
family office
called Excession LLC, formed in 2016 and run by
Jared Birchall
.
