The former Facebook product manager said the company puts profit over people and its products “harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy.” She called on Congress to take action against the company, as the platform, she says, has “repeatedly misled” the public and continues to hide research about its shortcomings. Facebook has pushed back on those claims. Our live coverage has ended. Read more about the hearing here . 38 Posts Key things the Facebook whistleblower told Congress The Facebook whistleblower who released tens of thousands of pages of internal research and documents testified before a Senate committee today about her experience working in the company and what steps she believes Congress should take against the social media giant. Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager who worked on civic integrity issues at the company, faced questions from the Commerce subcommittee about what Facebook-owned Instagram knew about its effects on young users, among other issues. If you are just reading in, here are some key things she told lawmakers: Haugen said during her congressional testimony that Facebook’s products “harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy” and put profit over moral responsibility. She called on Congress to take action to prevent harm caused by the social media company, including amending Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act . She said Facebook should “declare moral bankruptcy” and ask for help from Congress. Haugen testified that understaffing contributes to Facebook’s struggle to tackle problems and that artificial intelligence programs only catch a “very tiny minority” of offending content. The former Facebook employee said the company’s research reveals kids believe they are struggling with issues like body image and bullying alone because their parents can’t guide them. “I’m saddest when I look on Twitter and people blame the parents for these problems with Facebook. They say, ‘Just take your kid’s phone away.’ But the reality is that it’s a lot more complicated than that,” she said. Haugen emphasized how parents are facing a new set of challenges that didn’t exist when they were growing up. She stressed that schools and the National Institutes of Health should provide established information where parents can learn how to better support their kids. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, asked Haugen if the company is using its algorithm to push “outrageous content” and promoting eating disorders to young girls. She said that Facebook “knows it is leading young users” to content related to eating disorders. Haugen said she has “strong national security concerns” about how Facebook operates. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection, suggested that these national security concerns could be the subject of a future subcommittee hearing.

Monica Lewinsky: Whistleblower's testimony was "very brave" From CNN's Josiah Ryan Monica Lewinsky today praised a Facebook whistleblower’s testimony before Congress, drawing a parallel between the bullying many young people face on the platform and the mental health struggles she endured in the 1990s amid the scandal surrounding her affair with then-President Bill Clinton . “I think it’s worth mentioning that Frances Haugen, in testifying, how brave she was,” said Lewinsky, speaking on CNN. “…To come forward as a whistleblower…is very brave.” Lewinsky, who has called herself the “patient zero” of internet shaming, said she believes it is now clear that social media companies have a bigger role to play in minimizing potential harm to their users. “I absolutely think that all of the social media companies, even though they are trying, they can definitely do better and they need to do better,” she said. Link Copied! Facebook has invested heavily to influence Washington, records show From CNN's Fredreka Schouten Facebook, under intense scrutiny in Congress, has invested heavily in recent years to influence Washington. In the first six months of this year alone, the social media giant and its subsidiaries spent more than $9.5 million on lobbying, Senate records show. That made it the second-highest spender on lobbying this year among all Big Tech companies, according to Open Secrets , a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics and ranks lobbying spending. And last year, Facebook was the biggest Washington spender on lobbying in the world of Big Tech, Open Secrets found — plowing some $19.6 million into its efforts to shape US policy. Facebook’s lobbying agenda ranged from trade to Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act, which protects companies’ ability to moderate content, its filings show. On Tuesday, a Facebook whistleblower – former product manager Frances Haugen – urged Congress to take action to rein in the company. She said its products “harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy” as she testified before a Senate subcommittee on consumer protection. Members of that subcommittee, however, also have benefited from the company’s political activity. Facebook’s PAC has donated nearly $190,000 to the campaign committees and leadership PACs of most lawmakers on the panel, Federal Election Commission records show. All but one of the 12 lawmakers on the subcommittee – Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey – has received donations from the social media behemoth, according to federal records. Forbes first reported on the donations to members of the panel. Link Copied! Facebook executive says platform's algorithms are not designed to push inflammatory content From CNN's Josiah Ryan (CNN) Monika Bickert, vice president of content policy at Facebook, responded to a whistleblower’s accusations this afternoon, saying the platform does not push incendiary content in order to drive engagement. “It is not true,” said Bickert, when asked by CNN’s Alisyn Camerota if the platform’s algorithms are designed to push inflammatory content in order to draw more clicks and engagement. “We do the opposite, in fact, and if you look in our transparency center, you can actually see that we demote, meaning we reduce the visibility of engagement bait, click bait, and why would we do that? One big reason is for the long-term health of our services, we want people to have a good experience,” she said. Bickert was responding to whistleblower Frances Haugen’s testimony on Capitol Hill earlier in the day who said the company puts “their astronomical profits before people” and its products “harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy.” She called for congressional action against the social media giant. “When we realized tobacco companies were hiding the harms it caused, the government took action,” she said in her opening remarks. “When we figured out cars were safer with seat belts, the government took action. And today, the government is taking action against companies that hid evidence on opioids. I implore you to do the same here.” In one portion of the hearing, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, asked the former Facebook employee if the company is using its algorithm to push “outrageous content” promoting eating disorders to young girls. She said that Facebook “knows it is leading young users” to content related to eating disorders. The whistleblower also noted that Facebook’s artificial intelligence (AI) systems “only catch a very tiny minority of offending content.” Speaking on CNN this afternoon, Bickert did acknowledge the company could “do better” for some of its users. “Now, we need to do better for those who are having a bad experience,” she said. More background : Haugen’s identity as the Facebook whistleblower was revealed on “60 Minutes” Sunday night. She previously shared a series of documents with regulators and the Wall Street Journal, which published a multi-part investigation showing that Facebook was aware of problems with its apps, including the negative effects of misinformation and the harm caused by Instagram, especially to young girls, and that the company has tried to hide that evidence. CNN’s Samantha Murphy Kelly and Clare Duffy contributed reporting to this post. Link Copied! Senator says he thinks other whistleblowers will come forward From CNN's Adrienne Vogt (US Senate Committee) Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen was “compelling” and “credible” in her remarks before senators today, said Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, chair of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety and Data Security. “Frances Haugen wants to fix Facebook, not burn it to the ground,” Blumenthal said in a video call after the hearing. Blumenthal said Haugen had concrete recommendations on how to improve Facebook to make it more transparent and protect children. Haugen gave hope to parents concerned about the effects of social media on their children, the senator said. The lawmaker said he is convinced that other whistleblowers will come forward after Haugen’s testimony. Link Copied! Senators were gripped by Haugen's powerful testimony From CNN's Donie O'Sullivan Senators on both sides of the aisle praised former Facebook employee Frances Haugen for her powerful testimony on Capitol Hill today. In front of a packed press gallery in the Russell Office Building, one lawmaker pointed how meetings of a subcommittee don’t always attract this much attention. Haugen did not let the senators down – breaking down how platforms like Facebook and Instagram work and cause harm in a way that was accessible and mostly jargon-free. Hearings on Big Tech can regularly devolve into partisan point-scoring, but Haugen deftly handling lawmakers’ questions – maintaining regulation does not have to mean censorship. “You mentioned earlier concerns around free speech,” she told GOP Sen. Ted Cruz. “A lot of the things that I advocate for are around changing the mechanisms of amplification, not around picking winners and losers in the marketplace of ideas.” “What’s cool about Haugen’s testimony and this hearing is a real focus on amplification and algorithm design and not just censorship and bad info,” Charlie Warzel, a leading technology commentator, tweeted. “It feels like the advancement of the Facebook conversation/critique that a lot of close followers have been hoping for.” When Haugen’s three hours or so of testimony concluded, she picked up her black backpack and walked calmly for the exit – it is, however, unlikely to be her last time in a hearing room like this. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection, suggested the panel may ask her back to share further insights about Instagram’s harms on children and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff indicated yesterday she may be invited to appear before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection to testify on Facebook’s role in it.

Whistleblower: Removing likes isn't enough to address teen mental health concerns on Instagram From CNN's Clare Duffy Facebook earlier this year gave users on Facebook and Instagram the option to hide public like counts on their posts in an effort to reduce the pressure users feel to gain popularity. But Haugen said this isn’t sufficient to address teen mental health concerns on the platforms. Haugen said that based on the internal research she has viewed, “as long as comments are allowed on posts on Instagram, just taking likes off Instagram doesn’t fix the social comparison problem.” “Teenage girls are smart, they see that Sally is prettier than them, her pictures are really good, she gets tons of comments, she doesn’t get very many comments,” she said. “So I do think we need larger interventions than just removing quantitative measures.” Link Copied! Here's why the whistleblower says she is against breaking up Facebook From CNN's Aditi Sangal Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen told Senate lawmakers that she is “against the breaking up of Facebook.” For the past few years, there have been mounting calls from regulators in the United States and Europe to break up tech giants like Facebook. Lawmakers, publishers and other groups have criticized Facebook, in particular, for its handling of misinformation, its history of buying or copying rivals, and its data privacy practices, among other issues. But according to Haugen, breaking up Facebook won’t eliminate the potential risks the company poses to society. The problem lies in the design of algorithms and engagement-based ranking that surface potentially concerning content for users, and the limitations of artificial intelligence to address it, Haugen explained. “What I’m scared of is that Facebook is the internet for lots of the world. If you go to Africa, the internet is Facebook. If you split Facebook and Instagram apart, it’s likely that most advertising dollars would go to Instagram and Facebook will continue to be this Frankenstein that is endangering lives around the world. Only now there won’t be [advertising] money to fund it.” Haugen emphasized collaborative solutions with Congress, or else “these systems are going to continue to exist and be dangerous even if broken up.” Link Copied! Senator invites Facebook executive to testify on company's practices after tweet criticizing whistleblower Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, brought up a tweet that was posted by Andy Stone, Facebook communications executive, during the hearing. In the tweet , he said, “Just pointing out the fact that [Frances Haugen] did not work on child safety or Instagram or research these issues and has no direct knowledge of the topic from her work at Facebook.” Blackburn responded: “ So I will simply say this to Mr. Stone, if Facebook wants to discuss their targeting of children, if they want to discuss their practices, privacy violations, or violations of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, I am extending to you an invitation to step forward, be sworn in, and testify before this committee.” “We would be pleased to hear from you and welcome your testimony,” she added. More background: Haugen has been transparent about the fact that she did not work on child safety issues at Facebook; she noted in one answer that although she has some knowledge of the issue, she did not work directly on it. However, Haugen provided extensive internal documentation related to Facebook’s research on the topic to lawmakers. Link Copied! Whistleblower: "If Facebook won't protect the kids, we at least need to help the parents" From CNN Business' Samantha Kelly Frances Haugen said Facebook’s research reveals kids believe they are struggling with issues like body image and bullying alone because their parents can’t guide them. “I’m saddest when I look on Twitter and people blame the parents for these problems with Facebook. They say, ‘Just take your kid’s phone away.’ But the reality is that it’s a lot more complicated than that.” She emphasized how parents are facing a new set of challenges that didn’t exist when they were growing up. “Very rarely do you have one of these generational shifts where the generation that leads, like parents who guide their children, have such a different set of experiences that they don’t have the context to support their children in a safe way,” she testified. “We need to support parents. If Facebook won’t protect the kids, we at least need to help the parents support the kids.” She added that schools and the National Institutes of Health should provide established information where parents can learn how to better support their kids. Sen. Richard Blumenthal agreed. “Parents are anguished about this issue. They are hardly uncaring. They need the tools. They need to be empowered.” Link Copied! Whistleblower: "I have strong national security concerns about how Facebook operates today" From CNN Business' Clare Duffy Haugen, whose last role at Facebook was as a product manager supporting the company’s counter-espionage team, was asked whether Facebook is used by “authoritarian or terrorist-based leaders” around the world. She said such use of the platforms is “definitely” happening, and that Facebook is “very aware” of it. “My team directly worked on tracking Chinese participation on the platform, surveilling, say, Uyghur populations, in places around the world. You could actually find the Chinese based on them doing these kinds of things,” Haugen said. “We also saw active participation of, say, the Iran government doing espionage on other state actors.” She went on to say that she believes, “Facebook’s consistent understaffing of the counterespionage information operations and counter terrorism teams is a national security issue, and I’m speaking to other parts of Congress about that … I have strong national security concerns about how Facebook operates today.” Sen. Richard Blumenthal suggested that these national security concerns could be the subject of a future subcommittee hearing. Link Copied! Whistleblower: Transparency and dissolving an engagement-based ranking system would improve Facebook From CNN's Aditi Sangal Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen detailed how the social media platform could become a better environment, saying it could introduce transparency measures and small frictions, and move away from the “dangerous” engagement-based ranking system. This would recenter the methods of amplification and won’t focus not on “picking winners or losers in the marketplace of ideas,” she told senators on Tuesday. “On Twitter, you have to click through on a link before you reshare it. Small actions like that friction don’t require picking good ideas and bad ideas, they just make the platform less twitchy, less reactive. Facebook’s internal research says each one of these small actions, dramatically reduces misinformation, hate speech and violence-inciting content on the platforms,” Haugen said. She advocated for chronologically-ordered content instead. “I’m a strong proponent of chronological ranking, ordering by time, with a little bit of spammed emotion. Because I think we don’t want computers deciding what we focus on, we should have software that is human-scaled, or humans have conversations together, not computers facilitating who we get to hear from,” Haugen said. In addition, she encouraged a privacy-conscious regulatory body working with academics, researchers and government agencies to “synthesize requests for data” because currently, the social media giant is not obligated to disclose any data. “Even data as simple as what integrity systems exist today and how well do they perform?” she suggested. “Basic actions like transparency would make a huge difference.” What does engagement-based ranking system mean? Facebook, like other platforms, uses algorithms to amplify or boost content that receives engagement in the form of likes or shares or comments. In Facebook’s view, this helps a user “enjoy” their feed, Haugen explained. “The dangers of engagement-based ranking are that Facebook knows that content that elicits an extreme reaction from you is more likely to get a click, a comment or reshare,” which aren’t necessary for the user’s benefit, she added. “It’s because they know that other people will produce more content if they get the likes and comments and reshares. They prioritize content in your feed so that you will give little hits of dopamine to your friends so they’ll create more content.” Link Copied! Whistleblower: Facebook should declare "moral bankruptcy" and ask Congress for help Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen said it’s time for Facebook to declare “moral bankruptcy” and admit that they have a problem and they need help solving it. She said that since Facebook is a “closed system” the company has “had the opportunity to hide their problems.” “And like people often do when they can hide their problems, they get in over their heads,” Haugen added. She said that Congress should step in and say to the company, “You don’t have to hide these things from us” and “pretend they’re not problems.” She believes that Congress should give Facebook the opportunity to “declare moral bankruptcy and we can figure out how to fix these things together.” Asked to clarify what she meant by “moral bankruptcy,” Haugen said she envisioned a process like financial bankruptcy where “they admit did something wrong” and there is a “mechanism” to “forgive them” and “move forward.” “Facebook is stuck in a feedback loop that they cannot get out of…they need to admit that they did something wrong and that they need help to solve these problems. And that’s what moral bankruptcy is,” she said. Link Copied! The Senate hearing is back after a short break From CNN's Samantha Murphy Kelly and Clare Duffy The Senate hearing with Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen has resumed. The former Facebook product manager who worked on civic integrity issues at the company has been facing questions from a Commerce subcommittee about what Facebook-owned Instagram knew about its effects on young users, among other issues. “I am here today because I believe that Facebook’s products harm children, stoke division, and weaken our democracy,” she said during her opening remarks. “The company’s leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer but won’t make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people. Congressional action is needed. They won’t solve this crisis without your help.” She emphasized that she came forward “at great personal risk” because she believes “we still have time to act. But we must act now.” Read more about today’s hearing here. Link Copied! Whistleblower: Facebook's artificial intelligence systems only catch "very tiny minority" of offending content From CNN's Aditi Sangal Facebook’s artificial intelligence (AI) systems “only catch a very tiny minority of offending content,” whistleblower Frances Haugen told congressional lawmakers on Tuesday. “The reality is that we’ve seen from repeated documents within my disclosures, is that Facebook’s AI systems only catch a very tiny minority of offending content. And best case scenario, and the case of something like hate speech, at most they will ever get 10 to 20%. In the case of children, that means drug paraphernalia ads like that, it’s likely if they rely on computers and not humans, they will also likely never get more than 10 to 20% of those ads,” Haugen explained. She said the reason behind it is Facebook’s “deep focus on scale.” “So scale is, ‘can we do things very cheaply for a huge number of people?’ Which is part of why they rely on AI so much. It’s possible none of those ads were seen by a human,” she said. Link Copied! Facebook struggles to tackle problems because it's "understaffed," whistleblower says From CNN's Brian Stelter Facebook is extraordinarily profitable, so it is intriguing to hear Frances Haugen repeatedly refer to the company as “understaffed.” She said this staffing shortage contributes to a vicious cycle of platform-wide problems. “Facebook has struggled for a long time to recruit and retain the number of employees it needs to tackle the large scope of projects that it has chosen to take on,” Haugen said, emphasizing the word “chosen.” “Facebook is stuck in a cycle where it struggles to hire; that causes it to understaff projects; which causes scandals; which then makes it harder to hire,” she said. In a later exchange, Haugen described the following “pattern of behavior:” Often, she said, “problems were so understaffed that there was kind of an implicit discouragement from having better detection systems.” For example, “my last team at Facebook was on the counterespionage team within the threat intelligence org, and at any given time, our team could only handle a third of the cases that we knew about. We knew that if we built even a basic detecter, we would likely have many more cases.” It’s a twist on the adage about being “too big to fail.” Longtime tech reporter Craig Silverman observed that Haugen was calling Facebook “too big to staff.” Whistleblower Frances Haugen makes an important point: FB is so big that it struggles to staff projects. This  affects oversight and its ability to even know what's happening on the platform, let alone impact. Even its armies of contract workers aren't enough. Too big to staff... — Craig Silverman (@CraigSilverman) October 5, 2021 Link Copied! Whistleblower: Bullying on Instagram follows kids home From CNN's Aditi Sangal Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen told Senate lawmakers that Instagram has changed home lives for children. “The kids who are bullied on Instagram, the bullying follows them home. It follows them into their bedrooms. The last thing they see before they go to bed at night is someone being cruel to them. Or the first thing in the morning is someone being cruel to them. Kids are learning that their own friends, people who they care about, are cruel to them,” she said. This could potentially impact their domestic relationships as they grow older, Haugen added. “Facebook’s own research is aware that children express feelings of loneliness and struggling with these things because they can’t even get support from their own parents” who have never had this experience with technology, the former Facebook employee added. “I don’t know understand how Facebook can know all these things and not escalate it to someone like Congress for help and support in navigating these problems.” Watch here: 0d986b03-f671-4035-8a44-76a19e66f25b.mp4 02:03 - Source: CNN Link Copied! Facebook spokesperson weighs in on Haugen's testimony From CNN Business' Clare Duffy As lawmakers questioned whistleblower Frances Haugen about how Facebook attracts and treats young users, Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone pushed back in real time on Twitter.

Facebook whistleblower says 2020 election misinformation caused her to speak out From CNN's Adrienne Vogt Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen said the impetus for her to speak out came after the 2020 presidential election. “There was a long series of moments where I became aware that Facebook — when faced with conflicts of interest between its own profits and the common good, public safety — that Facebook consistently chose to prioritize its profits. I think the moment which I realized we needed to get help from the outside, that the only way these problems would be solved would be by solving them together, was when civic integrity was dissolved following the 2020 election,” Haugen told lawmakers at a Senate hearing. “It really felt like a betrayal of the promises that Facebook had made to people who had sacrificed a great deal to keep the election safe, by basically dissolving our community and integrating in just other parts of the company,” she said. Some more background: Haugen, 37, joined Facebook in 2019 to work on civic integrity, including “issues related to democracy and misinformation,” according to her website. Those issues have been front and center for critics of Facebook and other social media companies, particularly around the coronavirus pandemic and the 2020 US Presidential Election. Haugen took the job at Facebook to work on addressing misinformation, she said in a “60 Minutes” interview Sunday. Similarly to today’s hearing, she said her feelings about the company started to change when it decided to dissolve its civic integrity team shortly after the election. CNN’s Rishi Iyengar contributed reporting to this post. Link Copied! Whistleblower: Facebook "knows it is leading young users" to content promoting eating disorders Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, asked former Facebook employee Frances Haugen if the company is using its algorithm to push “outrageous content” promoting eating disorders to young girls. She said that Facebook “knows it is leading young users” to content related to eating disorders. “Facebook knows engagement-based ranking, the way they pick the content in Instagram for young users, for all users, amplifies preferences…They’ve done something called a proactive incident response where they take things that they heard, for example, can you be led by the algorithms to anorexia content and they have literally recreated this experiment and confirmed yes, this happens to people,” she said. Link Copied! Mark Zuckerberg's decision to go sailing comes under fire at Senate panel hearing From CNN's Clare Duffy Multiple senators criticized a sailing trip Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apparently took earlier this week amid a firestorm for his company. On Sunday, hours before Frances Haugen’s identity was revealed on “60 Minutes” and a day before an hours-long outage to Facebook’s products, Zuckerberg posted a video of his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, on a boat to his Facebook and Instagram pages . “Sailing with Priscilla and friends,” he said, adding that the video was shot on Facebook’s new Ray-Ban smart glasses . Senators were not amused. Sen. Richard Blumenthal said in his opening remarks, “Mark Zuckerberg ought to be looking at himself in the mirror today and yet rather than taking responsibility, and showing leadership, Mr. Zuckerberg is going sailing.” When they found out that their algorithms were fostering polarization, misinformation and hate, that they allowed 99% of their violent content to remain unchecked on their platform, including lead-up to the January 6 insurrection, what do they do? They now, as we know, Mark Zuckerberg’s going sailing and saying no apologies,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar added. Link Copied! Whistleblower: There was "an implicit discouragement from having better detection systems" at Facebook From CNN's Aditi Sangal Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen told lawmakers that understaffing issues often caused “an implicit discouragement from having better detection systems” at the tech company. “My last team at Facebook was on the counterespionage team within the threat intelligence org. And at any given time, our team could only handle a third of the cases that we knew about. We knew that if we built even a basic detector, we would likely have many more cases,” she said. This was a “pattern of behavior” that she said she observed. Link Copied! You'll hear a lot about Section 230 today. Here's what it is. From CNN's Brian Fung For decades, big tech companies have leaned on a little-known law to avoid being held responsible for some of the most controversial content on their platforms — Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. They have invoked it repeatedly in court cases to dismiss potentially costly lawsuits over messages, videos and other content created by users. What does Section 230 do? Under the law, tech companies can’t be sued for trying to do the right thing, though the federal government can still sue platforms over criminal content. The original intent behind Section 230 was to nurture startups and entrepreneurs. One of its key architects, Sen. Ron Wyden, has said that without the law, “all online media would face an onslaught of bad-faith lawsuits and pressure campaigns from the powerful.” The seemingly simple language of Section 230 belies the sweeping impact it’s had on the tech industry. Under Section 230, “interactive computer services” are considered legally separate from the users who generate their content. They can’t be said to publish or “speak” the words of their users. How do tech companies use this law? In practice, courts have repeatedly accepted Section 230 as a defense against claims of defamation, negligence and other allegations. In the past, it’s protected AOL, Craigslist, Google and Yahoo, building up a body of law so broad and influential that Section 230 has come to be described as “the 26 words that created the internet.” The Internet Association, a major trade group that represents Amazon ( AMZN ), Facebook and Google, has called Section 230 a “fundamental pillar” of the modern internet, saying it protects not just tech companies but all groups that offer a space for online communications, including schools, libraries, churches, or neighborhood organizations. But the immense scrutiny facing Big Tech — on everything from election security to privacy — has created a ripe political environment for questioning Silicon Valley’s most important legal shield. Link Copied! Whistleblower on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg: "The buck stops with him" Sen. Richard Blumenthal asked Frances Haugen if Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is the one making the decisions at the company. She responded by saying that Zuckerberg “holds a very unique role in the tech industry” in holding “over 55%” of the voting shares at Facebook.” “There are no similarly powerful companies that are as unilaterally controlled. And in the end, the buck stops with Mark. There’s no one currently holding him accountable but himself,” she told lawmakers. She added that Zuckerberg built an organization that is “very metrics driven.” “It is intended to be flat. There’s no unilateral responsibility. The metrics make the decision…And in the end, if he’s the CEO and chairman of Facebook, he is responsible for those decisions.” “The buck stops with him,” Haugen added.

Whistleblower calls on Congress to take action to prevent harms caused by Facebook From CNN's Clare Duffy Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen concluded the opening statement of her testimony by calling on Congress to implement regulations that “change the rules” for Facebook. “These problems are solvable. A safer, free speech-respecting, more enjoyable social media is possible,” she said. “Facebook can change, but is clearly not going to do so on its own. My fear is that without action, divisive and extremist behaviors we are seeing now are just the beginning.” Haugen added: “Congress can change the rules that Facebook plays by and stop the many harms it is causing.” Link Copied! Facebook outage prevented spread of divisiveness for a few hours, whistleblower says From CNN's Adrienne Vogt Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen addressed Monday’s widespread outage of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp while speaking before the Senate. “Yesterday we saw Facebook get taken off the Internet. I don’t know why it went down, but I know that for more than five hours, Facebook wasn’t used to deepen divides, destabilize democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies,” Haugen said. “It also means that millions of small businesses weren’t able to reach potential customers, and countless photos of new babies weren’t joyously celebrated by family and friends around the world. I believe in the potential of Facebook. We can have social media we enjoy that connects us without tearing apart our democracy, putting our children in danger and sowing ethnic violence around the world. We can do better,” she said.

Whistleblower: Facebook's products "harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy" Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen said in her opening statement to the Senate committee that the company’s leadership knows ways to make Facebook and Instagram safer but won’t do it “because they have put their astronomical profits before people.” Haugen said she came forward “at great personal risk” and is speaking out because she believes that Facebook’s products “harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy.” “I joined Facebook because I think Facebook has the potential to bring out the best in us, but I’m here today because I believe Facebook’s products harm children, stoke division, and weaken our democracy. The company’s leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won’t make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people,” she said. The whistleblower said that after having worked at four different types of social networks, she understands “how complex and nuanced these problems are,” but that the decisions “made inside of Facebook are disastrous” for children, public safety, for privacy and for democracy. “That’s why we must demand Facebook make changes,” she added. She continued later on in her statement: “The documents I have provided to Congress prove that Facebook has repeatedly misled the public about what it’s own research reveals about the safety of children, the efficacy of its artificial intelligence systems and its role in spreading divisive and extreme messages. I came forward because I believe that every human being deserves the dignity of truth.” Haugen told lawmakers “congressional action is needed” to solve this crisis. “Congressional action is needed. They won’t solve this crisis without your help,” she said. Link Copied! Damage inflicted by Facebook will "haunt a generation," Sen. Blumenthal says From CNN's Adrienne Vogt Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, chair of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security, expressed “heartfelt gratitude” to Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen for “standing up to one of the most powerful, implacable corporate giants in the history of the world.” Haugen, a former Facebook product manager, released tens of thousands of pages of internal research and documents indicating the company was aware of various problems caused by its apps. “Among other revelations, the information that you have provided to Congress is powerful proof that Facebook knew its products were harming teenagers,” Blumenthal said in the hearing. “Big Tech now faces Big Tobacco, jaw-dropping moment of truth. It is documented proof that Facebook knows its products can be addictive and toxic to children. And it’s not just that they made money; again, it’s that they valued their profit more than the pain that they caused to children and their families,” Blumenthal said. “The damage to self-interest and self-worth inflicted by Facebook today will haunt a generation. Feelings of inadequacy and insecurity, rejection and self-hatred will impact this generation for years to come. Our children are the ones who are victims. Teens today looking at themselves in the mirror feel doubt and insecurity.” He called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before the committee. “Mark Zuckerberg ought to be looking at himself in the mirror today and yet rather than taking responsibility, and showing leadership, Mr. Zuckerberg is going sailing,” he said. Blumenthal said his office conducted an experiment where it set up an account as belonging to a 13-year-old girl , followed some exercise and dieting accounts, and was served by Instagram’s algorithms with increasingly extreme content promoting eating disorders.

NOW: Senate hearing with Facebook whistleblower kicks off From CNN's Samantha Murphy Kelly and Clare Duffy The Facebook whistleblower who released tens of thousands of pages of internal research and documents indicating the company was aware of various problems caused by its apps, including Instagram’s potential “toxic” effect on teen girls, is set to soon testify at a Senate hearing titled “Protecting Kids Online.” Frances Haugen, a 37-year-old former Facebook product manager who worked on civic integrity issues at the company, will face questions from a Senate Commerce subcommittee about what Facebook-owned Instagram knew about its effects on young users, among other issues. In her prepared testimony obtained by CNN Monday ahead of her appearance, Haugen said, “I believe what I did was right and necessary for the common good — but I know Facebook has infinite resources, which it could use to destroy me.” Haugen added: “I came forward because I recognized a frightening truth: almost no one outside of Facebook knows what happens inside Facebook.” Haugen’s identity as the Facebook whistleblower was revealed on “60 Minutes” Sunday night. She previously shared a series of documents with regulators and the Wall Street Journal, which published a multi-part investigation showing that Facebook was aware of problems with its apps, including the negative effects of misinformation and the harm caused by Instagram, especially to young girls.

Monday's outage on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp came as difficulties mount for the company From CNN's Clare Duffy and Sean Lyngaas Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram went down yesterday for six hours. Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp all suffered outages midday Monday, according to public statements from the three Facebook services. Outage tracking site Down Detector logged tens of thousands of reports for each of the services. Facebook’s own site would not load at all; Instagram and WhatsApp were accessible, but could not load new content or send messages. The outage came amid mounting difficulties for the company. At a Senate hearing on Sept. 30 , Sen. Richard Blumenthal pressed Facebook global head of safety Antigone Davis on Facebook-owned Instagram and the platform’s potential negative impact on children, particularly young girls. On Sunday, “60 Minutes” aired a segment in which Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen claimed the company is aware of how its platforms are used to spread hate, violence and misinformation, and that Facebook has tried to hide that evidence. Facebook has pushed back on those claims. The interview followed weeks of reporting about and criticism of Facebook after Haugen released thousands of pages of internal documents to regulators and the Wall Street Journal. Haugen is set to testify before the Senate subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security on Tuesday. In her prepared testimony obtained by CNN on Monday ahead of her appearance before the subcommittee, Haugen said, “I came forward because I recognized a frightening truth: almost no one outside of Facebook knows what happens inside Facebook.” Facebook declined to comment Monday.

Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal told reporters on Monday evening that the hearing with Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen as the star witness would show a “very, very powerful bipartisan consensus that we’re going to support this whistleblower and any whistleblower against retaliation by Facebook.” He added that there is “strong bipartisan support for reforms, meaningful changes that will better protect kids.” Asked if he expected further revelations and whistleblowers to follow Haugen’s example, Blumenthal replied, “I hope this whistleblower coming forward with her courageous credible consistent testimony will encourage other whistleblowers.” He then added, “I know there are other whistleblowers out there.” Link Copied! Facebook whistleblower says she believes company could "destroy" her for speaking out From CNN's Samantha Murphy Kelly Frances Haugen with Scott Pelley during her "60 Minutes" interview on October 3, 2021. Frances Haugen, the Facebook whistleblower who released tens of thousands of pages of internal research and documents, said Facebook could “destroy” her for speaking out but she believed that “as long as Facebook is operating in the dark, it is accountable to no one.” In her prepared testimony obtained by CNN Monday ahead of her appearance before a Senate subcommittee today , Haugen said, “I believe what I did was right and necessary for the common good — but I know Facebook has infinite resources, which it could use to destroy me.” “I came forward because I recognized a frightening truth: almost no one outside of Facebook knows what happens inside Facebook,” Haugen added. The 37-year-old former Facebook product manager, who worked on civic integrity issues at the company, revealed her identity during a “60 Minutes” segment that aired Sunday night. In that segment, she said the documents show that Facebook knows its platforms are used to spread hate, violence and misinformation, and that the company has tried to hide that evidence. “When we realized tobacco companies were hiding the harms it caused, the government took action,” she said in the prepared remarks. “When we figured out cars were safer with seat belts, the government took action. And today, the government is taking action against companies that hid evidence on opioids. I implore you to do the same here,” she said. Link Copied! Instagram promoted pages glorifying eating disorders to teen accounts. Here's what we learned. From CNN's Donie O'Sullivan, Clare Duffy and Sarah Jorgensen “I have to be thin,” “Eternally starved,” “I want to be perfect.” These are the names of accounts Instagram’s algorithms promoted to an account registered as belonging to a 13-year-old girl who expressed interest in weight loss and dieting. Proof that Instagram is not only failing to crack down on accounts promoting extreme dieting and eating disorders, but actively promotes those accounts, comes as Instagram and its parent company Facebook are facing intense scrutiny over the impact they have on young people’s mental health . Instagram acknowledged to CNN this weekend that those accounts broke its rules against the promotion of extreme dieting , and that they shouldn’t have been allowed on the platform. The extreme dieting accounts were promoted to an Instagram account set up by Sen. Richard Blumenthal’s staff. The Connecticut senator’s team registered an account as a 13-year-old girl and proceeded to follow some dieting and pro-eating disorder accounts (the latter of which are supposed to be banned by Instagram). Soon, Instagram’s algorithm began almost exclusively recommending the young teenage account should follow more and more extreme dieting accounts, the senator told CNN. Blumenthal’s office shared with CNN a list of accounts Instagram’s algorithm had recommended. After CNN sent a sample from this list of five accounts to Instagram for comment, the company removed them, saying all of them broke its policies against encouraging eating disorders. “We do not allow content that promotes or encourages eating disorders and we removed the accounts shared with us for breaking these rules,” a spokesperson for Facebook, Instagram’s parent company told CNN. “We use technology and reports from our community to find and remove this content as quickly as we can, and we’re always working to improve. We’ll continue to follow expert advice from academics and mental health organizations, like the National Eating Disorder Association, to strike the difficult balance between allowing people to share their mental health experiences while protecting them from potentially harmful content.” Speaking to CNN Monday, Blumenthal said: “This experience shows very graphically how [Facebook’s] claims to protect children or take down accounts that may be dangerous to them are absolute hogwash.” Read the full story here.

The Senate grilled a Facebook executive last week over the company's impact on kids From CNN's Samantha Murphy Kelly Antigone Davis, Facebook's global head of safety, testifies virtually during a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety and Data Security hearing on children's online safety and mental health on Capitol Hill on September 30, 2021 in Washington, DC. Patrick Semansky/Pool/Getty Images Today’s hearing with a Facebook whistleblower is the second of two hearings that the Senate Commerce Committee is holding on how Facebook approaches its younger users. Last Thursday, Facebook’s global head of safety, Antigone Davis, was grilled by senators about the impact its apps have on younger users, after an explosive report indicated the company was aware that Facebook-owned Instagram could have a “toxic” effect on teen girls. “We now know that Facebook routinely puts profits ahead of kids’ online safety. We know it chooses the growth of its products over the well-being of our children,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal said in opening remarks at the hearing. “And we now know it is indefensibly delinquent in acting to protect them.” “The question that haunts me,” Blumenthal added, “is how can we, or parents, or anyone, trust Facebook?” In a sign of the bipartisan pressure on this issue, Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn echoed Blumenthal in her opening remarks directed at Facebook. “We do not trust you with influencing our children,” she said. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier last month that researchers at Facebook have been conducting studies for the past three years into how Instagram, which it owns, affects its millions of young users. The research shows the platform can damage mental health and body image, especially among teenaged girls. Blumenthal said his office created an Instagram account identifying as a 13-year-old girl. It followed some easily discoverable accounts associated with extreme dieting and eating disorders. Within a day, he said, the Instagram recommendations were “exclusively filled” with other accounts that promoted self harm and eating disorders. (Davis said those accounts would be in violation of Instagram’s policies that crack down on content promoting self-harm.) Following the Journal report, Instagram said it was looking at new ways to discourage users from focusing on their physical appearance. The company also said that while Instagram can be a place where people have “negative experiences,” the app also gives a voice to marginalized people and helps friends and family stay connected. “What’s been lost in this report is that in fact with this research, we’ve found that more teen girls actually find Instagram helpful — teen girls who are suffering from these issues find Instagram helpful than not,” Davis said Thursday. “Now that doesn’t mean that the ones that aren’t, aren’t important to us. In fact, that’s why we do this research.” Davis, who identified herself as a mother and former teacher, also pushed back on the idea that the report was a “bombshell” and did not commit to releasing a full research report, noting potential “privacy considerations.” She said Facebook is “looking for ways to release more research.” Read more about last week’s hearing here. Link Copied! Key things to know about Frances Haugen, the revealed Facebook whistleblower From CNN's Brian Stelter Frances Haugen was a product manager on Facebook’s civic misinformation team. “During her time at Facebook,” her bio says , “Frances became increasingly alarmed by the choices the company makes prioritizing their own profits over public safety — putting people’s lives at risk. As a last resort and at great personal risk, Frances made the courageous act to blow the whistle.” Haugen now identifies herself as “an advocate for public oversight of social media.” She rolled out a new website , Twitter profile and online identity in the minutes before her blockbuster “60 Minutes” interview aired on CBS. The Wall Street Journal confirmed that Haugen was the key source for last month’s “Facebook Files” project. Reporter Jeff Horwitz said he had been calling her “Sean” for “the past ten months.” Now, he said, Haugen “will be speaking for herself from here on out.” Horwitz also published a profile of Haugen at the same time the “60 Minutes” story premiered. “If people just hate Facebook more because of what I’ve done, then I’ve failed,” she told the Journal. She said she’s trying to save Facebook, not destroy it. “I believe in truth and reconciliation — we need to admit reality,” Haugen said. “The first step of that is documentation.” How Facebook responded to the “60 Minutes” interview: Facebook spokesperson Lena Pietsch said this on Sunday night: “Every day our teams have to balance protecting the ability of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place. We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.” A version of this post first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. You can sign up for free here. Link Copied! Facebook recently paused plans to create an Instagram for kids From CNN's Samantha Murphy Kelly Instagram is pressing pause on plans to develop a version of its service for kids under 13 after facing pressure from lawmakers to back down on the effort and new questions about the impact the photo-sharing service has on teen girls. “While we stand by the need to develop this experience, we’ve decided to pause this project,” Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, wrote in a blog post published last Monday. “This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today.” The move came days before the US Senate was set to hold a hearing entitled “Protecting Kids Online: Facebook, Instagram, and Mental Health Harms” to discuss the pressure today’s youth face on social media. That hearing occurred after a Wall Street Journal investigation around what Facebook knows about how Instagram affects teen users, including their mental health. Today, a Facebook whistleblower who released tens of thousands of pages of internal research and documents is set to testify in the Senate in a hearing on “protecting kids online.” More on the decision: Mosseri acknowledged that the Journal’s reporting “has raised a lot of questions for people.” In a statement earlier this month , an Instagram official noted that while Instagram can be a place where people have “negative experiences,” the app also gives a voice to marginalized people and helps friends and family stay connected. “This is a watershed moment for the growing tech accountability movement and a great day for anyone who believes that children’s wellbeing should come before Big Tech’s profits,” Josh Golin, executive director at Fairplay, a child advocacy group formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, said in a statement Monday. Link Copied! The Facebook whistleblower will testify soon before a Senate committee. Here are key things to know. From CNN's Clare Duffy Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager, spoke with Scott Pelley during a "60 Minutes" interview that aired on October 3, 2021. The Facebook whistleblower who released tens of thousands of pages of internal research and documents indicating the company was aware of various problems caused by its apps, including Instagram’s potential “toxic” effect on teen girls, is set to testify at a Senate hearing today. Frances Haugen, a 37-year-old former Facebook product manager who worked on civic integrity issues at the company, will face questions from a Senate Commerce subcommittee about what Facebook-owned Instagram knew about its effects on young users, among other issues.

She previously shared a series of documents with regulators and the Wall Street Journal, which published a multi-part investigation showing that Facebook was aware of problems with its apps, including the negative effects of misinformation and the harm caused by Instagram, especially to young girls. Some background: About a month ago, Haugen filed at least eight complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission alleging that the company is hiding research about its shortcomings from investors and the public. She also shared the documents with the Wall Street Journal, which published a multi-part investigation showing that Facebook was aware of problems with its apps, including the negative effects of misinformation and the harm caused, especially to young girls, by Instagram. Facebook has aggressively pushed back against the reports, calling many of the claims “misleading” and arguing that its apps do more good than harm. Read more about Haugen’s testimony here .
