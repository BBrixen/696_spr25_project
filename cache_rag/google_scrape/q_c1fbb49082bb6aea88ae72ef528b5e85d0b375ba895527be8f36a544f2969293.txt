Share 9 Jul 2021 12.01 EDT Today was all about Mark Cavendish but here’s the overall GC . Nothing changed after stage 13. Tadej Pogacar (UAE Team Emirates) 52hr 27min 12sec Rigoberto Uran (EF Education–Nippo) +5min 18sec Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) +5min 32sec Richard Carapaz (Ineos Grenadiers) +5min 33sec Ben O’Connor (AG2R Citreon) +5min 58sec Share 9 Jul 2021 11.57 EDT More from an exhausted but delighted Cav . Here’s his response to being asked about the record. He’s finding it hard to process. I haven’t realised it. It’s still just another win on the Tour de France. It’s like my first one. I’ve won a stage of the Tour de France. It’s what I dreamed of as a kid and it’s what I dream of now. I’ve worked so hard for it. We’ve seen such a growth, especially in the UK, of cycling since I’ve started racing here at the Tour de France. If anyone of my wins can inspire the kids to ride the Tour de France or the Tour de France Femmes from next year when they grow up, that’s what means the most to me I think.

The Belgian, a five-time overall winner of the Tour, took the last of his stage wins in 1975. 🐐 CAV𝟯𝟰DISH 🐐 #TDF2021 pic.twitter.com/I7iHVp7AlA — Tour de France™ (@LeTour) July 9, 2021 Share 9 Jul 2021 11.50 EDT No words needed! #34 #TDF2021 Photo: @BeelWout pic.twitter.com/7x0j3EYBHe — Deceuninck-QuickStep (@deceuninck_qst) July 9, 2021 Share 9 Jul 2021 11.43 EDT Stage 13 report from Jeremy Whittle in Carcassonne. Mark Cavendish equals record with 34th stage win in Tour de France Read more Share 9 Jul 2021 11.41 EDT Can 34 become 35? Cav has a couple of obvious opportunities to take the record on his own. The first is on stage 19 into Libourne and, of course, the other is the final day on the Champs-Elysees. Anyway, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Time to drink in what he’s done today. Share Updated at 11.45 EDT 9 Jul 2021 11.34 EDT Cavendish speaks: Cav looks in shock as he tries to reflect on what’s just happened. “I’m so dead. 220km in that heat. In that wind. I went deep there, I went so deep there. The boys were incredible. Can’t believe it.” View image in fullscreen Mark Cavendish wins it on the line.

Share 9 Jul 2021 11.23 EDT Mark Cavendish wins the stage and ties the record! He’s done it! Cavendish has equalled Eddy Merckx’s record of 34 stage wins! It’s a messy finish with Cav having to find a way through when seemingly blocked off but the Manx Missile solves the puzzle, hits the burners and lets out a roar as he crosses the line in front of his own lead-out man Michael Morkov. Remarkable! What a man! 3⃣4⃣ @MarkCavendish makes history with 34 @LeTour stage wins, as many as Eddy Merckx. Average speed in the last 500m: 57.1km/h #TDF2021 #TDFdata https://t.co/cGjelMxGOp — letourdata (@letourdata) July 9, 2021 Share Updated at 11.36 EDT 9 Jul 2021 11.22 EDT 1km to go: Three blue jerseys lead the way as they set up Cav. This is on! Share 9 Jul 2021 11.21 EDT 1.5km to go: Mattia Cattaneo (DQS) hits the front as the road narrows. Cavendish perfectly placed. Share 9 Jul 2021 11.20 EDT 3km to go: There’s a battle going on to get the wheel of Cavendish. Pace quickening. Share 9 Jul 2021 11.18 EDT 5km to go: No-one making a move yet. Cav staying in the centre of the road about 12th from the front as they take a big sweeping turn. Share 9 Jul 2021 11.16 EDT 7km to go: Colbrelli has been up there all day and moves up to fourth. The road is packed; the tension is building. Share Updated at 11.16 EDT 9 Jul 2021 11.13 EDT 9km to go: Cavendish with his “assassin’s face on” says the Eurosport commentator. Nice way of putting it. Cav in about 10th with his main rivals for the stage tracking him. Share 9 Jul 2021 11.12 EDT Robin Hazlehurst writes: “Random prediction: Nacer Bouhhani to deny Cav on the line but later get DQ’d for taking a diagonal line, meaning Cav gets his record but without the celebration. Hope I’m wrong...” Share 9 Jul 2021 11.09 EDT 12km to go: Pogačar’s yellow jersey is prominent in about 10th place as he stays out of trouble. All a bit messy out front with no team in control as they try and avoid some road furniture and take another roundabout. Share Updated at 11.10 EDT 9 Jul 2021 11.05 EDT Pacher back in the pack: Ineos-Grenadiers move up to the front. Cav surrounded by rival teams right now but still plenty of time to go. Plenty of echelons forming as the winds become a factor but it looks as if Froome and Alaphilippe have ben dropped. Share 9 Jul 2021 11.02 EDT Contenders aplenty with 20km to go: Those who will try and latch onto Cav’s wheel - Van Aert, Philipsen, Bol, Bouhanni and Matthews. Sean Kelly nails his colours to Philipsen even though he admits Cavendish will be hard to beat. Share 9 Jul 2021 10.58 EDT 22km to go: Pacher’s futile bid won’t last much longer. Meanwhile, there’s been another mini-crash. Just bike damage rather than cuts and bruises it seems. The official site reports that Barbero and Henao (Qhubeka) as well as Donovan (DSM) are involved in this latest one. They’ll be allowed back on but this adds to the nerves. Share Updated at 10.59 EDT 9 Jul 2021 10.52 EDT Another one out: Lucas Hamilton has also been forced to retire following the crash. Share 9 Jul 2021 10.46 EDT 30km to go: Pacher has a 1min 4 sec lead over Jan Bakelants while the peloton, led by Alaphilippe, is at 1min 19. Cavendish safely positioned near the front. Share 9 Jul 2021 10.40 EDT Cav’s bike change: Eurosport commentator Sean Kelly says: “You don’t change bikes for the sake of it. There must have been something he was uncomfortable with.” 34km to go. Share 9 Jul 2021 10.38 EDT 40km to go: Quentin Pacher (B&B) has attacked, opening up a 30-second gap at the front. A roll of the dice that probably won’t come off although, as I write, it’s now 40 seconds. Back down the road, a quick bike change for Cav. No need to panic though; he’s quickly back on after some help from his teammates. Share Updated at 10.39 EDT 9 Jul 2021 10.34 EDT Some opinions coming in on the crash . Frank Vlaeminck writes: “Totally unnecessary this fall. Apparently there was a patch of rough asphalt following a smooth stretch. The organisation could have prevented the crash if they’d made use of mobile signalling, the way they do it in some Italian races. Just put someone with a flag there until the peloton has passed.” Share 9 Jul 2021 10.30 EDT Simon Yates abandons That crash has put Yates out of the race unfortunately. Initially, it seemed he was okay to continue but it seems the injuries he suffered won’t allow it. Share 9 Jul 2021 10.28 EDT An omen: Edward Pollard writes: “Just before the Tour started I moved from Cavendish Road to Hope Street. So today here’s hoping all comes good for Cav.” I’m pretty sure I took a photo of Cavendish Drive when Le Tour came through Bingley in West Yorkshire seven years ago. Share 9 Jul 2021 10.25 EDT Mark Cavendish currently 45km away from making history . Eddy Merckx has said he won’t lose any sleep over his record of 34 stage wins being matched and would be the first to congratulate Cav. The live betting has Cavendish at Even money to win today’s stage. View image in fullscreen Mark Cavendish in action on stage 13.

It’s a hot day out there with temperatures pushing 28 degrees. The slow pace has allowed those injured in the crash to come across so we’re just going through a re-set phase. Share 9 Jul 2021 10.18 EDT The crash: Welsh speakers get live reaction too. Damwain yn y peloton! A crash in the peloton! 🚴🏼♂️ Le Tour de France | Cymal 12 | S4C #TDF2021 pic.twitter.com/3pgrM98pf8 — Seiclo (@SeicloS4C) July 9, 2021 Share 9 Jul 2021 10.17 EDT Breakaway caught: The inevitable happens as Goldstein and Latour get absorbed by the pack led by Julian Alaphilippe. Worth noting that the yellow and green jerseys of Pogacar and Cavendish avoided the crash. View image in fullscreen Omer Goldstein Pierre Latour of France are caught by the peloton.
