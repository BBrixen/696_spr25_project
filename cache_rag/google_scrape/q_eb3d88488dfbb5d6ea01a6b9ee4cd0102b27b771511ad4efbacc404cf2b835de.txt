Halep's superior experience was evident, and the Romanian prevailed 6-3, 6-3. Rafael Nadal qualified for the 2019 Wimbledon quarter-finals Monday after he dominated Joao Sousa 6-2, 6-2, 6-2. No. 8 seed Elina Svitolina beat Petra Martic to qualify for the last eight, while Barbora Strycova surprised Elise Mertens to return to the Wimbledon quarter-finals after making her maiden appearance five years ago. Monday's Results Men's Singles (3) Rafael Nadal bt. Joao Sousa: 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 Women's Singles Alison Riske bt. (1) Ashleigh Barty: 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 (8) Elina Svitolina bt. (24) Petra Martic: 6-4, 6-2 Shuai Zhang bt. Dayana Yastremska: 6-4, 1-6, 6-2 Barbora Strycova bt. (21) Elise Mertens: 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 (11) Serena Williams bt. (30) Carla Suarez Navarro: 6-2, 6-2 (7) Simona Halep bt. (Q) Coco Guaff: 6-3, 6-3 Recap Nadal was relentless in his mission to make it back into the Wimbledon quarters for a seventh time in his career, breaking Sousa early in each of the three sets and thriving on his serve. The third seed won 30 of his 35 first-serve points and was particularly strong at the net, knocking Sousa out after the Portuguese beat 13th seed Marin Cilic and Briton Dan Evans in a five-set thriller. Not in any mood to wait, Nadal finished his victory with a vicious ace, via ATP Tour: Riske already caused an upset in the first round versus 22nd-ranked Donna Vekic and came back from a set down to defeat No. 13 Belinda Bencic 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 on Saturday. Barty conceded 25 unforced errors and sealed her exit with a wayward backhand: The Australian's higher error count shouldn't take anything away from Riske's impressive display, however, and she extended her own imperious record on grass: One would think things only get simpler after knocking out Wimbledon's No. 1, but the quarter-final threat of Williams ensures it's anything but a dip in opponent next up. The No. 11 seed looked ruthless throughout most of Monday's meeting with Suarez Navarro and got off to a strong start in each set, establishing a pace her foe couldn't keep up with. Suarez Navarro's exit was sealed with a wayward return attempt, falling in the fourth round for a fourth time while Williams advanced to Wimbledon's last eight for a 14th time: Ukraine had mixed fortune in the women's fourth round on Monday, as Svitolina advanced into the last eight while compatriot Dayana Yastremska suffered defeat to Shuai Zhang. Svitolina notched a 6-4, 6-2 win over Martic, although tennis writer Ben Rothenberg said that scoreline slightly flattered the victor: Unseeded Zhang, 30, laboured to a 6-4, 1-6, 6-2 victory over Yastremska and qualified for her first Grand Slam quarter-final, where she will face Halep. Mertens was another upset casualty Monday after Strycova beat the 21st seed 4-6, 7-5, 6-2. The Belgian was on the verge of joining those making their maiden appearances in the Wimbledon quarter-finals, but instead, Strycova will advance to that stage for the second time in her career. 04:50 NBA Comps for Top Bigs üë• TOP NEWS Post-Draft NFL Power Rankings Bleacher Report 15h NFL Draft Picks We Wanted to See üëÄ Bleacher Report 15h Latest Projections and Pro Comps ‚úçÔ∏è Bleacher Report 15h Ranking Top 10 Free Agents Post-Draft Bleacher Report 15h Way-Too-Early 2026 Mock Draft Bleacher Report 1d TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 11h Russini Says She Never Got Intel Browns Ranked Shedeur Sanders High on Draft Board Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d WWE Raw Results, Winners, Live Grades, Reaction, Highlights from April 28 ‚öîÔ∏è Jey, Logan Paul on collision course  üçø Ripley and Perez put on a show üì≤ Tap for full results and analysis Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 12h Shedeur Sanders Reportedly Was Top QB on Giants' Board After Cam Ward Ahead of Draft Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d 1 Trade Every NBA Playoff Team Wishes It Could Make Right Now Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 8h Michael Porter Jr. Not Suspended for Leaving Bench During Nuggets-Clippers Skirmish Michael Porter Jr. not suspended Game 5 for leaving bench during skirmish TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 11h Russini Says She Never Got Intel Browns Ranked Shedeur Sanders High on Draft Board Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d WWE Raw Results, Winners, Live Grades, Reaction, Highlights from April 28 ‚öîÔ∏è Jey, Logan Paul on collision course  üçø Ripley and Perez put on a show üì≤ Tap for full results and analysis Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 12h Shedeur Sanders Reportedly Was Top QB on Giants' Board After Cam Ward Ahead of Draft Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d 1 Trade Every NBA Playoff Team Wishes It Could Make Right Now Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 8h Michael Porter Jr. Not Suspended for Leaving Bench During Nuggets-Clippers Skirmish Michael Porter Jr. not suspended Game 5 for leaving bench during skirmish Bleacher Report About Advertise Contact Us Get Help Careers Sitemap Community Guidelines Privacy Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information Terms Of Use AdChoices B/R Sports on MAX B/R Creators Program Copyright ¬© 2025 Bleacher Report, Inc.
