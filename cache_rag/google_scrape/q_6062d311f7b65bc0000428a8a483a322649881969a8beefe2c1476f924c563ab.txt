The game originally launched on WiiU and had a different proposition than the Xenoblade Chronicles. We know it didn't manage to cross 1m on WiiU, shackled by an underperforming platform. The Xenoblade franchise has grown a lot during the Switch era with the whole trilogy (XC2, XC: DE, XC3) likely crossing 2M units on the platform. For those that don't know much about the series and why it is beloved, there's a fan-made video below. Now, Xenoblade Chronicles X is looking like a worthy rerelease, in line with the great work done by Monolith Soft in the past. It release timing is interesting, as the only Nintendo game in two months, but also two weeks before their Switch 2 Direct. Do you believe the game will also cross 1M units in only 12 days ? How close do you expect its launch sales to be from the other Xenoblade games? Will the Switch audience show up once again, despite all the eyes  focused on Switch 2? Does the X subseries have a higher potential than other Xenoblade games? Looking forward to read your thoughts Quoted by: SkyerIst Kenka Member Enthusiast Mar 12, 2025 #2 Xenobalde's unveiling on a random Tuesday was genuinely baffling and it probably played a role in the public's great reception of the announcement. But on the topic of sales, yes, I think the game can sell 1M copies eventually. Can it reach 2M? I don't know yet. No one does, really. The uncertainty of the global economy and the imminent unveiling of the Switch 2's launch date and price will affect its sales. K KarlRemarx Member Analyst Mar 12, 2025 #3 I think its performance is highly dependent on whether there is a segment during the Switch 2 Direct that shows the game with significant resolution/framerate enhancements. If they showcase it and a couple of other games as a group of flagship enhanced titles I think it'll have a longer sales curve. Without that I think it'll significantly underperform relative to other Xeno games, less noticeably so in Japan but in US/Europe it's going to have a rough time. By now I think there's more than enough data to show that if Nintendo want to maximise sales, they can't skip Directs anymore - in the last year or so I'd say Mario Party Jamboree is really the only title that hasn't noticeably suffered from the lack of a Direct. I know Switch 2 is the reason behind it, but I think relatively smaller titles like this need to be grouped into the Direct format alongside bigger stuff like Mario Party so that a wider group of customers are made aware of it. As for this question: Does the X subseries have a higher potential than other Xenoblade games? Click to expand... Even if it did, an awkward release spot at this stage in the Switch 1 life cycle simply can't be overcome I think. I don't think sales potential for these games is attached to particular series/subseries but something more akin to how Atlus/FromSoft operate, where they grow an audience attached to the studio reputation and gameplay specifics/genre rather than particular titles. I will say, as far as sales potential goes, they'd be much better served by having a non sci-fi RPG alternative to Xenoblade, rather than simultaneously operating a series and subseries that are completely interchangeable sci-fi JRPGs to casual observers. Whereas some other genre of fantasy or a contemporary setting might give them a break out hit of a different flavour than Xenoblade.

Every Xenoblade game has a niche audience, should still be enough to sell 1 million copies, that would be half the amount of normal Xenoblade games, which seems like a natural level of decline this late into the Switch lifespan. I don't see why the decline would be 60-70 % though compared to normal Xenoblade sales.

IMO, they can hit 1M if Nintendo ships a lot of units, but I don't expect sell-through to hit that Mekanos Member Enthusiast ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¸ Pronouns he/they Mar 12, 2025 #9 It's the fourth Xenoblade game coming out on the ninth year of the Switch. There just isn't much wiggle room for a game like that. It'll sell 1 million but more than that I have my doubts.

Z Z-Z0 Member Student Mar 13, 2025 #11 I think 1+ million should be a lock due to how big Switch is and how the Xenoblade fanbase has grown. In case it doesn't pass 1 million by the end of March will we ever get the numbers from Nintendo?

Aostia82 Member Enthusiast Mar 13, 2025 #17 I don't think it's underestimated Me think it will sell 1m+ for sure, not bad for the "remaster" of a game within a brand that is now around 2mil sales range, being released also this late in the lifecycle and being the 4th iteration of the franchise itself on the console Metal Gear Miyamoto Member Analyst Pronouns He/Him Mar 13, 2025 #18 Yes, it is being underestimated. The socials have been pretty good and quite a bit of positive WoM has been generated over the past couple of weeks as more info has come out. But what I see people keep missing is that Open World games have sold incredibly well on Switch and this game is set to take advantage of that base of players who may be looking for their next fix. I'd expect it to become the second best-selling Xenoblade on the system at 2,5 million units ww. 1-1.5 in the first 12 days. And by end of next fiscal quarter an additional 1 million. Color me shocked if it becomes the best-selling entry. D dubious donkey Member Rookie Pronouns he/him Mar 13, 2025 #19 the Switch is over saturated with Xenoblade and the system is in its twilight.

But still it should sell well the first 2 weeks at least. AuroraMusisAmica Member Scholar Mar 14, 2025 #29 The question can be answered from a few positions: Is XBCX underestimated in the broader market context? Yes. Switch is a 150+ million platform that's still engaging to its playerbase despite an 8+ year run. Switch players still want quality games to play, and so far this year Nintendo has dropped the ball in servicing such a need. Somewhat understandable considering the successor is months away, but Nintendo fans have been left with a (second) Remastered DKC Returns and now a "Director's Cut" Remastered XenoBlade Chronicles X. The upside for the latter game is that it was woefully underappreciated being stuck on the Wii U, and now has a chance to reach a wider, appreciative audience. So yes, it has all the qualities of doing well. Is XBCX underestimated in the mind of a dedicated, internet savvy audience (such as ours)? No. In fact, the franchise itself is overestimated in its reach, prestige, and (in this case) sales ceiling. XenoBlade Chronicles on Wii was a bright spot for a Wii system that had lost all momentum (releasing in 2011 in the West). It was everything dedicated fans had wanted: a serious (on a console many considered "unserious" and "kiddy"), open world (when most JRPGs were still struggling with this concept, even on HD consoles), real time JRPG that made its mark immediately upon launch. Monolith Soft made a statement, and audiences paid attention. Due to NoA's treatment of the title and its distribution, it didn't see the sales success it clearly deserved (but I do love that reversable cover ^_^). Nintendo clearly course corrected, seeing fan response and critical praise. Not only was there a sequel, but XenoBlade Chronicles 2 was out year one and part of its holiday sales push. Quite the affirmation from Nintendo. And not only did XBC2 do well, but had good legs, especially for a JRPG. As of 2022, the game had sold 2.7 million copies. Thing is, XBC2 (2.7) XBCD (1.9) and XBC3 (1.9) have sold well. But they're certainly not paradigm shifting titles from a sales standpoint. They're... good. And only good. Especially on a super-successful system whose rising tide has lifted countless games with it. Here's Nintendo series on Switch who have seen a higher ceiling than the XenoBlade franchise: Mario Kart Animal Crossing Super Smash Bros. The Legend of Zelda (3D) Super Mario Bros. (3D) PokÃ©mon Mario Party Super Mario Bros. (2D) Switch Sports Ring Fit Adventure (the true JRPG king this generation!) Luigi's Mansion Splatoon Kirby The Legend of Zelda (2D) Clubhouse Games Donkey Kong Country Mario Tennis Fire Emblem 1-2 Switch Pikmin Paper Mario Yoshi Metroid (2D) Arms XenoBlade Chronicles But on dedicated gaming and Nintendo message boards, you'd think XenoBlade was a top 10 (even top 5) franchise for the big N. Yes, it is a well received, critically acclaimed, and much beloved series developed out with the efficiency like no one else in gaming (That Monolith can put out two sequels, a remake, and a ground-up remaster in one generation in today's dev climate is amazing. All while supporting other studios). But the series is limited in its reach and impact on the wider market. Part of that is the decline of the JRPG as an entire genre (even XenoBlade, which was innovative in 2011, is not immune), but there's other elements that hold it back from being a franchise that truly pushes Nintendo's position forward. A certain XenoBlade lovin' nopon wont like me for saying this, but: XenoBlade is not an important franchise for engaging a wide audience. It has its fanbase. It has its place in Nintendo's portfolio. But it is a place in the shadows of much larger franchises that have much larger impacts. As of now, XBC has not hit that paradigm shift that other franchises saw with Switch (3D Zelda, Animal Crossing, 3D Mario, PokÃ©mon, Kirby, Splatoon, Luigi's Mansion, etc.). It has its place, but not as a market-changer. TLDR: It will do well, but remain in its B-Grade sales tier. Quoted by: SkyerIst D Dangerous92 Member Rookie Mar 14, 2025 #30 X is much more western inspired than the trilogy, it has lots of potential, wish it used a different Xeno name SquidEnthusiast Member Analyst SRL Intern Mar 14, 2025 #31 As long as it sells relatively on par with the other Xeno games I'll be satisfied. I don't think anyone is expecting a BOTW moment here. SkyerIst Member Analyst Mar 14, 2025 #32 AuroraMusisAmica said: Fire Emblem Click to expand... Interestingly, Xenoblade as a series has been growing faster since its inception compared to Fire Emblem. Fire Emblem debuted in 1990 and got its first million-selling game in 2013 with Fire Emblem Awakening (not counting re-releases). Nintendo is very happy with Xenoblade. This franchise fills an important niche and is growing. When comparing Xenoblade's sales to those of JRPGs from other developers, the biggest difference lies in the fact that Nintendo offers fewer discounts, which makes Xenoblade's sales even more impressive. For example, Tales of Arise, the biggest game in the Tales series, debuted in 2021 and, as of 2024, has sold 3 million copies across 5 platforms. It has seen many price drops and promotions since its release, with its price sometimes dropping to $9.99. Tales of Arise price history, PS Store Xenoblade 2 debuted in 2017 and had sold 2.7 million copies on 1 platform by 2022. It is still priced at $59.99 on the eShop , although its price sometimes drops to $39.99. However, as you can see below, its discount chart is VERY different overall. Xenoblade 2 price history, US eShop Another example is Yakuza: Like a Dragon, the biggest game in the Yakuza series. It debuted in 2020 and sold 1.8 million copies across 5 platforms by December 2023. Sega was very pleased with the results. Here's its discount chart... Again, it's very different from Xenoblade and other Nintendo games. Like a Dragon price history, PS Store Xenoblade 3 Xenoblade: Definitive Edition Final Fantasy XVI Dragon Quest XI etc... Nintendo stands out from the rest when it comes to pricing, which makes the growth of its franchises like Xenoblade even more impressive.

If a big and critically acclaimed open world canâ€™t crack 1.3/1.5m on Switch Iâ€™ll be very confused Aostia82 Member Enthusiast Mar 15, 2025 #46 AruanaRiva said: Probably not.

Ballpark for Wii U version is higher, between 700k/800k I thin 2mil is possible, even if Switch version should slightly overperform here Quoted by: AruanaRiva OP OP Lelouch0612 Staff Archivist Genius Staff Mar 16, 2025 Thread starter #47 Lelouch0612 said: Amazon preorders for the game, one week before launch: Japan - 4.000+ (#6) US - N/A France - 1.000+ (#19) Spain - 2.000+ (#2) Germany - 1.000+ (#6) UK - 1.000+ (#35) Click to expand...

It makes the 5.62M Kirby sold on Wii U* look smaller than the 4.99M Metroid sold on NSW. Besides that the comparison isn't totally fair either as far as numbers of titles/platform is concerned. Click to expand... *Sold on Wii U and 3DS. By far most of it on 3DS. It doesn't compare the different franchises to each other, so that doesn't matter. 2 platforms against one and the Switch still does way better? The numbers of titles are mostly very comparable. 1 2 3 Next 1 of 3 Go to page Go Next Last You must log in or register to reply here.
