It only took me reading the first few posts to see that pretty much everyone says slams are. This has prompted me to post this. The fact is, whilst weeks at number 1 are nice, it's the year ending number 1 that counts and matters most. The year ending #1 gives you accolades that  weeks at 1 simply does not give you. I have set out below the accolades you get from either. Weeks at #1 accolades: Gets mentioned on a tennis forum repeatedly by fanboys to try and refute debates. Year ending #1 accolades Acknowledged as the world champion of tennis in that year by the professional tour. You win a very nice piece of silverware. Get to meet all the other YE#1s from time to time at official ATP events. Forever known as a world champion in your chosen field. No one remembers who led the the F1 drivers championship, they only remember who won it. Tennis is no different, unless of course you're a keyboard warrior. Had Rojas been number 1 from January to October and lost the ranking at the end, would he be in the history books as much as he is now? Quite simply, no. If you had to chose between narrowly leading the field for 40 weeks and finishing the year second, or narrowly trailing the number 1 spot for 40 weeks and finishing the year number 1, what would you choose? This is a rhetorical question, so to all you trolls, don't bother answering. It's all about the YE#1. That is all. Reactions: killerboi2 , KingKyrgios , ghostrider and 1 other person pc1 G.O.A.T.

Reactions: VolleyHelena and tenisdecente -NN- G.O.A.T. Feb 7, 2017 #9 I find YE#1 more important but don't discount weeks at #1 and its perks. Problem is, I can't track the weeks a player has spent at #1 through much of tennis history. If we could, I'd treat it more seriously. For players in this modern age, I can treat it more seriously, but I still see each season as a new season and the YE#1 as the player who best conquered that season; the player who won the race/championship.

Feb 7, 2017 #12 GameSampras said: I'm sure it would be possible to come up with an equivalent system using weeks instead of years yes. The reason I default to years is it's easier to track it through the entirety of tennis history. Weeks is a more recent thing. Also, I think there is value in proving you are the best of the lot over an official calendar season. We could go by weeks worth for most players in the Open Era but I'd have to revert to years for the old guard.. and I'd probably still give an additional bonus for YE#1 regardless. Obviously, weeks vs years has been a hotly contested debate here at TTW. Example, I could go by weeks worth of number one, so Federer at 302 or whatever it is = roughly 6 years, which would give him 18 points. He's also been the Ye#1 5 times, so perhaps I'd award him an additional point for each of those 5 years, totalling to 23 "#1 points". ** I meant calendar season, not system - LOL Click to expand... Dark Magician said: My point is - Lets say player A remains #1 throughout 2015 but in 2016 he loses #1 rank to player B in mid 2016. In this 2 year period, player A is #1 for 1.5 years but plyaer B for 0.5 years. Yet both of them get same points. May be we could give bonus points to a player if he is #1 throughout the year and not lose his spot to anyone else. So, in the case I mentioned, player A and B both get 3 points but A gets an extra point for being #1 throughout in 2015. I know this can get messy, but then we are all just speculating. Click to expand... GameSampras said: I'm suggesting that we award points according to time spent at #1, with a years worth = 3 points (actually I'm changing that to 4 points now with Slams worth 3 over the 1 point of the YEC). If I were to make a rough point system, I'd put Masters at 0.5, YEC at 1, Slams at 3 and each years worth of time spent as #1 at 4 points, with an additional +2 bonus point for ending the year #1. So in your scenario for that specific window.. Player A: 0.5 years as #1 awards 2 points and he gets an additional 2 points for finishing as YE#1 once, for a total of 4 points. Player B: 1.5 years as #1 awards 6 points and he gets an additional 2 points also for a total of 8 points. Nadal's #1 points would be 11+6 and Djokovic's 14+8 (roughly speaking). Federer's would be 24+10. Sampras's would be 22+12. With someone like Pancho Gonzales, I'm going to award him a minimum amount of time that is equivalent to the years he was considered the #1 player, so that's 7 years worth of time at #1 + 7 YE#1 for 28+14 = 42.

But it is a ludicrous notion to suggest the a YE ranking at #1 represents a greater accomplishment than weeks at #1. While not a #1 situation, we do have a recent case with Milos Raonic. I believe that he reached his all time high of #3 at the end of Nov 2016. However, when the AO finished in Jan, he was back down to #4. He was at the #3 spot for barely more than 2 months before dropping back down to #4.  It would have been much more impressive and more of an accomplishment if he was at #3 for 3-6 months but lost it at the end of the year. I'm sure that the very same thing has happened at the top (#1) with other players quite a few times as well.

But it was a total mess in the pro years and early open years. So the present system works pretty well from at least 1990 on but was horrible before that. As for #1 for the year, so many years were disputed before recent times so that doesn't work out too well. Reactions: vive le beau jeu ! BGod G.O.A.T. Feb 8, 2017 #26 It comes down to grouping.

There isn't a meaningful season in tennis, year end ranking is no more special than ranking at any other point in the year. Sampras was the #1 player 1 more time than Federer over the 52 weeks from 1/1-12/31 (6 vs. 5). Federer was the #1 player over any series of 52 weeks 16 more times than Sampras was (302 vs. 286). Of course, Federer was a more dominant #1 on average than Sampras was. However, these two players are relatively close in years ending #1 and total weeks #1 anyways, so they aren't a really good test case here. It isn't even clear we have a good test case to evaluate, as Andy Roddick was the YE#1 with the fewest weeks #1 (13), while the most Becker had the most weeks #1 without finishing YE#1 (12). So on both counts, Roddick was superior to Becker. Reactions: tenisdecente and Thorondor SystemicAnomaly Bionic Poster Feb 8, 2017 #33 buscemi said: Interestingly, it hasn't.

See, but I think I'd disagree with you on that point. Ferrero was #1 for a chunk of time in 2003 before Roddick took over toward the end of the year. Even if Ferrero became #1 after the 2003 French Open and held that ranking until after the U.S. Open, I'd still prefer Roddick's year-end #1 ranking to Ferrero's greater number of weeks at #1. Of course, in reality, Roddick also had more weeks than Ferrero at #1, but I don't see how number of weeks changes the equation. In either case, Roddick would still be the best player of 2003 while Ferrero would be the best player for some random period of time between 2002 and 2003. tennisaddict Bionic Poster Feb 8, 2017 #40 Is this the last record that Sampras has over Fed ?

Click to expand... tennis is actually quite different, and the analogy pointless, since tennis rankings operate on a rolling last--52--week basis, while F1 standings begin anew each year.  So total weeks at number 1 would be all but meaningless in F1 since it would only be based on a race or two at the start of the season, while rankings in tennis are always meaningful since they're always based on the past year.

Would be hilarious if Fed ends up No 1 end of this year. What will be left for @Blocker @FudgeControl @90''sClay ? Click to expand... If someone talked about Fed's chance of finishing 2017 as no.1 4 weeks ago, I would've probably laughed. However, I think Federer actually has positioned himself as a realistic contender for it by winning the AO. The reasons why I believe this are; 1) Federer's consistency. We know he can still make SF/F of virtually every slam that's left and every other 1000/500 tourneys. Consistency is his trademark and I don't see why he cannot keep making SF/F of every single tournaments and win some of them this year. He will keep racking up good ranking points as long as he stays healthy, so his health is the biggest factor in him challenging for his 6th YE no.1. 2) Both Djokovic and Murray didn't get many points from AO. These two guys were supposed to be the top guys of 2017 and I think they will eventually assume their dominance as the year progresses. However, their point deficit is already near 2,000 points, and with these guys keep competing against each other, they will take points away from each other which could potentially make it harder for them to catch Fed. Of course, a few health issues from Fed and a couple of M1000 wins for either these guys will get them on level terms very quickly, but as long as Federer stays healthy, I think 2,000 points deficit will look quite big since Federer will keep getting points with his consistency. 3) Both Djokovic and Murray are quite beatable in 2017 and up and coming youngsters may knock them out early from given tournaments. There's no guarantee they will catch Federer rapidly unlike previous years. This kind of environment will actually help Federer keep his lead. I don't think Federer is thinking about YE no.1 at all at this point and I think he shouldn't either. However, it's fun for us fans to make predictions, and mine is that as long as Federer doesn't get injured and successfully competes in all the tournaments he's set out to participate in 2017, he has a realistic chance for YE no.1 in 2017 now that he's won a slam.

Best is to take in mind the number of weeks at #1 Click to expand... See, but I'd reverse that. Weeks at #1 in a year when a player didn't finish #1 are just some random moments when a player was #1. Ferrero was #1 from September 8-November 2, 2003. That means that he had the best combination of results from the late part of 2002 and the early and middle parts of 2003. It was cool that he was #1, but it doesn't really mean much. He wasn't the best player in 2002, and he wasn't the best player in 2003. Conversely, Roddick took over the #1 ranking late in 2003 and lost it early in 2004 when Federer took over. But this wasn't just a radom moment when Roddick was #1. It will always be written in the record books that he was the #1 player in 2003, the best player in the world for that particular year. Even if Ferrero had taken over the #1 ranking after winning the 2003 French Open, I'd still prefer Roddick's year-end #1 to Ferrero's greater number of weeks at #1.
