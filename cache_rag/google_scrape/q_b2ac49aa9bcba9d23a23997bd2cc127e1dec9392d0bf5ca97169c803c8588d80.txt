Dev says that all players wants to play with other ppl but i believe thats not the case at all. Some players like my self enjoy playing this game to relax SOLO. They also said that this game dont need constant internet for some things in game but they are wrong. Game needs internet for every single thing in the game. They complain(developers) that they learned from Diabli 2 that offline mode was bad. My question is , whats wrong with Diabli 2? One of the best games you ever made. So rich story so much different enemies, so much different gear etc. Whats wrong beeing able to play offline or when net connection is bad to play online? And it happends. I believe that the product thar you sell or any product that you sell full game for the price should be mine. Tomorrow Blizzard can have breakdown or decide to go off with Diablo 3 server, and what then? You took whats rightfully mine. For me,player that's playing blizzard games for almost 20 years and mani others, this game should have Offline(single player) and online co op mode. It works for 90% of the market pretty well why it should not work for Diablo 3 or upcoming Diablo 4. I know that allot ppl will not agree but allot will, but i believe that Developers better know what we want then we do. Ty. Read more New to Reddit?
