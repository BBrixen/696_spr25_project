The film academy and ABC broadcasted the Oscars from the historic Union Station in Los Angeles and the Dolby Theatre at the Hollywood & Highland Center. The award show honored films that were released in 2020. Years after the Academy Awards were harshly criticized as “OscarsSoWhite” — and after the film academy's membership was greatly expanded in recent years — a historically diverse slate of nominees led to records in many categories. David Fincher’s “Mank” lead the nominations at the 93rd Academy Awards garnering 10 nominations, and for the first time, two women — Chloé Zhao and Emerald Fennell — were nominated for best director. While lockdowns have certainly fueled streaming service subscriber growth, the pandemic has been nothing short of punishing for the movie industry . As film production numbers slowed to a crawl, blockbuster releases were postponed or pushed over to streaming platforms, and thousands in the industry have been laid off or furloughed. But, the outlook for Hollywood has recently brightened a bit as coronavirus case numbers have plateaued and the vaccine roll out has ramped up dramatically. Movie theaters are reopening in the U.S.’s two largest markets, New York and Los Angeles. And, several larger movies — including the Walt Disney Co.’s “Black Widow” (May 7) — are scheduled for May and beyond.
