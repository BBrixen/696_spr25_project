The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica Article History Table of Contents Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot It is one of the most grueling events in all of sports. Over the span of about 20 days, Tour de France cyclists cover some 3,600 km (2,235 miles) of both flat land and great stretches of mountainous inclines. The annual race’s most difficult section is known as the “circle of death.” The rare cyclist who can perform well at both time trials and climbing usually ends up wearing the yellow jersey ( maillot jaune ) of victory. The first Tour was held in 1903, and 60 cyclists competed, though only 21 finished. Maurice Garin of France was the winner. While cheating has marred the Tour from the start, in recent years the race has been especially tarnished by allegations of illegal drug use. Several winners have been stripped of their titles, most notably Lance Armstrong , who was the first rider to capture seven titles. The current record holders have won five Tours each: Jacques Anquetil of France (1957 and 1961–64), Eddy Merckx of Belgium (1969–72 and 1974), Bernard Hinault of France (1978–79, 1981–82, and 1985), and Miguel Indurain of Spain (1991–95). The table provides a list of all Tour de France winners.
