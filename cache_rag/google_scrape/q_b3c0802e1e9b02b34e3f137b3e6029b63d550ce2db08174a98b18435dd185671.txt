Manage Topics News Nintendo Switch Nintendo Direct Splatoon 2 Release Dates Splatoon 2 Splats on Switch on 21st July New modes and amiibos in tow by Steve Bowling Thu 13th Apr 2017 Share: 14 Subscribe to Nintendo Life on YouTube 810k During today's Nintendo Direct we got a ton of new info on Splatoon 2 . The biggest news of all was the announcement of a solid release date of 21st July. It's a bit earlier than we expected, but we aren't complaining. The most exciting bit of news in our humble opinion was the addition of a new mode dubbed Salmon Run, in which a team of four inklings battle waves of salmon-like enemies in order to harvest their eggs. Nintendo also announced a new set of three amiibo, an inkling boy, inkling girl and a purple squid,similar to the set that launched with the original. Unlike the previous sets you can now save outfits for your squid kid onto the amiibo, as well as take photos with your friends and share them on social media. We here at Nintendo Life are immensely excited for Splatoon 2; what do you make of today's announcements? Let us know in the comments.

That new mode is just... MMMMMM 11 2 liljmoore Wed 12th Apr 2017 Day 1 buy. We got 3 months left. I figure that we will get at least 2 more testfires. 6 3 Jhena Wed 12th Apr 2017 So i can play like to weeks before paying for online? The zombie mode felt kinda dark. But maybe it was just a dark map. Seems fun. 1 4 123akis Wed 12th Apr 2017 I love the new mode, and I love Splatoon! 7 5 TimelessJubilee Wed 12th Apr 2017 That horde mode looks fun. 4 6 Megal0maniac Wed 12th Apr 2017 Was wishing for a release early June or maybe even end of May, but I knew that was wishfull thinking July is fine.. but not sure if I'll be playing it that much during that summer period. 0 7 IceClimbers Wed 12th Apr 2017 Awesome zombie/horde mode. Zombie salmon? Amazing. Wish it was coming out a little bit earlier, but I'm hyped regardless! 2 8 yasin88 Wed 12th Apr 2017 After July 21st, I will have vitamin D deficiency from staying in doors all day lol. 3 9 ianl579 Wed 12th Apr 2017 I expected more but I am SOLD. Buying the game and amiibo Day ONE! 0 10 Kienda Thu 13th Apr 2017 New Salmon Heads mode looks awesome. Great to have some team co-op against AI to break from Battles. Looking forward to the single player Nintendo Direct. I complete that mode and all Amiibo in the first game and loved it. Also those Salmon guys look a little like Murlocs from World of Warcraft. 1 11 Bread-Not-Toast Thu 13th Apr 2017 Can't wait till PETA starts moaning about shooting salmon with ink. 16 12 SillyG Thu 13th Apr 2017 @yasin88 : Take it out of the dock and get your Vitamin D dose with your Switch outdoors. Bam! Two birds, one stone. 6 13 RustedNoodle Thu 13th Apr 2017 looks great i cant wait to play 1 14 cfgk24 Thu 13th Apr 2017 @yasin88 Take your SWITCH outside! 4 15 Altaria_97 Thu 13th Apr 2017 I didn't like the style of the trailer, but the actual content it showed off was great. Salmon Run looked like a horde/zombies type of mode, which is pretty cool to see in Splatoon. I didn't care much for the amiibo announcements, but I was relieved to see the release date set for mid-July.  I was expecting an August release, so it's great to hear that I will be able to play it for a full month before going back up to school. Overall, I liked what they showed off and I'm super hyped! 2 16 KittyKatta Thu 13th Apr 2017 Hopefully they have Bots available at launch so we can play offline. 0 17 Ryu_Niiyama Thu 13th Apr 2017 I'm not getting the amiibo and I still have questions about single player, but so far I'm hyped. 0 18 JJ286 Thu 13th Apr 2017 How many modes are now? Turf War? the new Salmon Mode, what else?? 0 19 Kienda Thu 13th Apr 2017 @Bread-Not-Toast PETA will also complain that collecting Salmon eggs will encourage people to eat caviar. 2 20 JJ286 Thu 13th Apr 2017 Also I'm not sure if i'll get the amiibo but the game for sure. 0 21 yasin88 Thu 13th Apr 2017 @cfgk24 Oh yeah, I feel so stupid now lol 1 22 cfgk24 Thu 13th Apr 2017 @yasin88 lol This summer - I will be setting up a portable projector with a Battery powered SWITCH dock in the town centre in Spain for MK8 and SPLA2oon Parties! 3 23 ballistic90 Thu 13th Apr 2017 ...I don't believe it, but they found a way to make me more excited for Splatoon 2. 3 24 westman98 Thu 13th Apr 2017 Pretty much the release date I expected. Horde mode looks pretty cool. 0 25 Fandabidozi Thu 13th Apr 2017 I'm all over that new squid Amiibo might have to pre order that to make sure I get it. 0 26 ThatNyteDaez Thu 13th Apr 2017 I will have this game downloaded the very morning it goes live on the E-shop. I might just take that day off work too. Along with a few others... 0 27 masterLEON Thu 13th Apr 2017 Yeah, I'm gonna have to take that weekend off 1 28 Deku-Scrub Thu 13th Apr 2017 I'm really happy with the new PvE mode, that's going to be a blast to play I'm also glad they're keeping support for the old amiibo in the game 0 29 Ryu_Niiyama Thu 13th Apr 2017 @Bread-Not-Toast Well the oil rig looks like it was owned by BP.... 1 30 Zingo Thu 13th Apr 2017 Fresh! 0 31 JaxonH Thu 13th Apr 2017 Ever since the testfire my hype has gone into warp speed And ya know, this is a game changer. So many people excited to see the single player against Octarians, because "what if I play on the go" but now with mobile hotspot you can play smooth, lag free online anywhere! I didn't even know how hotspot worked or what it was or if I even had it before the test fire. But now I've seen the light. Simple as tapping "hotspot" on my phone, and it instantly turns my phone into a wireless router, my Switch automatically connects and with a full 3 bars of strength. One full hour of test fire play in online matches... only used 0.11gb. That's peanuts for a full hour of online gaming. You could play 10 hours a month when you're out and about and still only eat up 1 gigabyte. 3 32 itslukec Thu 13th Apr 2017 @Kienda Mmmrrrggglll!!! 1 33 gatorboi352 Thu 13th Apr 2017 All I want to know is can you finally change your load outs between matches?  Or god forbid, during the match ala Call of Duty? 1 34 Aurumonado Thu 13th Apr 2017 Salmon run looks awesome 0 35 Oat Thu 13th Apr 2017 The amiibos look great! Cant wait to get them. I do wish that the game was releasing earlier :/ 0 36 retropunky Thu 13th Apr 2017 That new mode though... man I can't wait for this. It's shaping up nicely. I hope the solo campaign is just as good! 0 37 Blazinglegend16 Thu 13th Apr 2017 Do our previous amiibos work? I mean like the amiibo for splatoon, not splatoon 2 0 38 Bolt_Strike Thu 13th Apr 2017 I must be the only one underwhelmed with Salmon Run, it just looks so generic. Splatoon's gameplay is usually pretty quirky and unconventional but this mode just looks so typical and unexciting. What does this game mode do that we haven't already seen a zillion times? 0 39 SnowFox Thu 13th Apr 2017 I was hoping for Testfire 2 to be announced, because I didn't have a Switch during the 1st one. Lol Kinda wish this game came out earlier, but the current date gives me plenty of time to play ARMS and the other May releases. 0 40 Rumncoke25 Thu 13th Apr 2017 I have been curious about Splatoon, but I'm officially looks forward to this title. I still hope for a robust single player mode as I am not a fan of multiplayer shooters, but I WANT to really like this game. The colors and style are appealing, and I showed my girlfriend, a staunch non gamer, and she thought the game looked fun. Like a wild game of paintball where her words. Any game that might get her into playing with me is a game I'm excited about. If they allow bots to play offline this game sounds perfect for us. If not I guess I'll have to try to find a few friends here that might be interested in a match or two... 0 41 Bezbot Thu 13th Apr 2017 At least they aren't making it a 3 pack of all the amiibo 0 42 Bezbot Thu 13th Apr 2017 @Rumncoke25 You play with other random people online, or with your friends, at least on the original. So if you don't have friends, you always have everybody else on the online world. 0 43 Bezbot Thu 13th Apr 2017 @Blazinglegend16 Yes, but nothing has been said about what they do. 0 44 Luffymcduck Thu 13th Apr 2017 Wished for an earlier release but 21st of July is still fine. 0 45 coolaggro Thu 13th Apr 2017 I hope the Amiibo do more, like give you clothe gifts similar to how they sort of mentioned. Or similar to Breath of the wild type of thing 0 46 Deadlyblack Thu 13th Apr 2017 I figured this game would release in July. I can't wait, I never played the first game. 0 47 westman98 Thu 13th Apr 2017 Both DQXI and Splatoon 2 launching in the same month means July will be one of the biggest non-holiday months in the Japanese gaming industry since the end of the 7th generation. 1 48 Arnold-Kage Thu 13th Apr 2017 The new mode seems like a lot of fun and the news we are getting a splatoon 2 direct in the future is great news. The fact we are getting new amiibo is alright but is it just me or is the squid form amiibo similar to what we got already? 0 49 Pazuzu666 Thu 13th Apr 2017 Pass. I played both this and MK8 to death via my WiiU. Neither offer a significant upgrade enough to warrant a purchase at this stage. Still, with Zelda, Master Blaster Zero and Dragons Trap (incoming), I'll be alright for now. 0 50 Lord Thu 13th Apr 2017 I'm in! 0 51 starman292 Thu 13th Apr 2017 I thought the new mode looked great!  I really hope they do a test fire on it before launch 0 52 datamonkey Thu 13th Apr 2017 They could have called this Spla2oon! [I'm available for hire Nintendo..!] 0 53 SKTTR Thu 13th Apr 2017 That co-op defense mode with the slimy fish waves got me very intrigued. Looks so much fun to play on- and offline. It's great to see a totally fresh and fun new mode in Splatoon 2 instead of just another variation of the battle mode. After watching footage of that new mode I'm much more interested to play this than yesterday. I now even plan on buying. At this point, a more fleshed out single player campaign (compared to Splatoon 1) would totally sell this for me sooner rather than later. 1 54 BlueKnight07 Thu 13th Apr 2017 I'm impressed.  Looking forward to this one. 0 55 abbyhitter Thu 13th Apr 2017 I would totally get addicted to the Salmon Run mode like I did with Rainmaker in the first game. 0 56 Highlar Sat 15th Apr 2017 I've already had this preordered and paid for for about a month now. One of the primary reasons I wanted a Switch. 0 Show Comments Leave A Comment Hold on there, you need to login to post a comment...
