Cities That Have Hosted The Olympics - WorldAtlas Cities That Have Hosted The Olympics The first modern Summer Olympic Games were hosted in Athens, Greece , in 1896. They have continued to be held every four years in various cities around the world despite a few cancellations and one postponement. The 1916 games, due to be held in Germany, were canceled due to World War 1 , while the 1940 and 1944 games were canceled due to World War 2 . The 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo were notably postponed until the year after due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A separate Winter Olympic Games was added in 1924 and held every four years except for an 8-year hiatus due to World War 2. The first Winter Olympics were held in Chamonix, France, and like their summer counterpart, they have been hosted in varying cities ever since. Cities are chosen in advance based on various criteria, mainly pertaining to financial standings, availability of sporting facilities and amenities for athletes/attendees, political stability, and climate (it's a good idea to have snow for the Winter Games). In total, there have been 31 Summer Olympics in 21 different cities and 24 Winter Olympics in 21 cities. The next summer games will be held in Los Angeles, California, in 2028. The next Winter Olympic Games are due to be held in 2026 in Milan, Italy . Some cities have been home to the Olympics more than others. Here are the cities that have seen the most Olympic Games (summer and winter combined), along with how many they've hosted and in what years: Context Matters How Often Are The Olympics?

Image by kovop via Shutterstock.com Although not quite as big as the Summer Games, the Winter Games gave sports that require a cold environment a chance to be displayed to the world. Skiing, snowboarding, hockey, curling, speeding skating, and others have been mainstays for the Winter Games. The first time they were hosted in 1924 in Chamonix, there were 16 events across six sports, and the upcoming games in Milan will have 116 events across 16 different sports. It should be noted that the 1994 Winter Olympics were the only Olympics to be held two years after the previous Olympic Games of the same kind. This was due to a decision by the IOC ( International Olympic Committee ) in 1986 (finally implemented in 1994) to ensure that the Summer Games and Winter Games were no longer held in the same year. 1924 - Chamonix, France 1928 - St. Moritz, Switzerland 1932 - Lake Placid, United States 1936 - Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany 1940 (canceled) - Sapporo, Japan 1944 (canceled) - Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy 1948 - St. Moritz, Switzerland 1952 - Oslo, Norway 1956 - Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy 1960 - Olympic Valley (formerly "Squaw Valley"), United States 1964 - Innsbruck, Austria 1968 - Grenoble, France 1972 - Sapporo, Japan 1976 - Innsbruck, Austria 1980 - Lake Placid, United States 1984 - Sarajevo, Yugoslavia 1988 - Calgary, Canada 1992 - Albertville, France 1994 - Lillehammer, Norway 1998 - Nagano, Japan 2002 - Salt Lake City, United States 2006 - Torino, Italy 2010 - Vancouver, Canada 2014 - Sochi, Russia 2018 - PyeongChang, South Korea 2022 - Beijing, China What's Going On?
