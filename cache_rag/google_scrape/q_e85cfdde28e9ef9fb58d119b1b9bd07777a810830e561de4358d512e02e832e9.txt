Members Online • Caciulacdlac Top 1% Commenter Directors approached by Marvel for every MCU film Other So I made a list with every director attached to a MCU project (or just approached). This includes previous versions of the movies that didn't materialize (along with the year they were attached/approached). The final director is always listed the last.

Or maybe they weren't reported. I also find it fascinating that we could have seen Tarantino's Iron Man, or del Toro's Doctor Strange or Thor. EDIT: Added Sam Mendes for Avengers (2012) and Sam Raimi for Thor. Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
