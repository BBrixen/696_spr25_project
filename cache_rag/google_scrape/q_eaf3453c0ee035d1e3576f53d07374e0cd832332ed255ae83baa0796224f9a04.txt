The Shape of Water What to Know Critics Consensus The Shape of Water finds Guillermo del Toro at his visually distinctive best -- and matched by an emotionally absorbing story brought to life by a stellar Sally Hawkins performance. Read Critics Reviews Critics Reviews View All (465) Critics Reviews Chris Bennion Times (UK) You’ll either be charmed by Hawkins’s ethereal, wordless performance or you won’t, but del Toro’s use of a vivid colour palette would impress anyone. Feb 14, 2023 Full Review Anupama Chopra Film Companion The Shape of Water is visionary filmmaking. Rated: 4/5 Sep 6, 2018 Full Review Robert Daniels 812filmreviews So, while we know Elisa has humanity, Del Toro has to plead his case for the fish-man. Rated: 3.5/4 Sep 5, 2018 Full Review Preston Barta Denton Record-Chronicle Guillermo del Toro’s enchanting fairy tale comes alive [... in this] seamless blending of practical effects and CGI, showcasing [a] vibrant palette that immerses you in its surreal atmosphere. Jan 15, 2025 Full Review JD Duran InSession Film Guillermo del Toro’s The Shape of Water is a beautiful and fully realized film about loneliness and our desire for love. Aug 7, 2024 Full Review Diana Tuova Spotlight on Film Del Toro has made a film whose dark, sublime, watery beauty is indisputable, and whose story is as much an intriguing "beauty-and-the-beast" ballad as it is a captivating homage to the different and the extraordinary. Rated: 4.5/5 Aug 2, 2024 Full Review Read all reviews Audience Reviews View All (1000+) audience reviews Andrew A it was just a fun story that put a smile on my face. Rated 5/5 Stars • Rated 5 out of 5 stars 10/01/24 Full Review João Vinícius A There are a legion of people who still think The Shape of Water is a complete horror show, but in my humble opinion, this film is far from being "so-so", in other words, it is a true masterpiece that very few people really understand. Sally Hawkins has never been as brilliant and recognized as before, and her performance alongside the formula is something that will stay with you for days. In addition, the romantic scenes between the couple are so well done and so engaging that, even if it borders on madness, it feels like I was hypnotized and being carried away by a strong and gentle current. Congratulations, Guillermo Del Toro, you did what you know how to do and then some. Rated 5/5 Stars • Rated 5 out of 5 stars 03/30/25 Full Review Waniya S Since it was a romantic movie, I would have appreciated more scenes where they emotionally connect with each other. Put it was all shown through one perspective. The scenes were cute but I would have enjoyed more if there weren't just crumbs. Rated 2.5/5 Stars • Rated 2.5 out of 5 stars 03/29/25 Full Review Ali H Fantastical, otherworldly genius Rated 5/5 Stars • Rated 5 out of 5 stars 03/06/25 Full Review john w Superb Movie , Hawkins is Magnificent as a the entire cast. Rated 5/5 Stars • Rated 5 out of 5 stars 03/04/25 Full Review Ryland C Weird and with an odd premise but it works! Easily one of the best films from Guillmero Del Toro.
