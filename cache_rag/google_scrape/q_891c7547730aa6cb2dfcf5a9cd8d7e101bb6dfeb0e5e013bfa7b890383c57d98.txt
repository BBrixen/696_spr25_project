Contributors Written by: Mike Lukas Sports Betting & Gambling Industry Analyst To learn more check out our Editorial Guidelines . Updated: Jan. 22, 2025, 08:20 AM ET 10 min read The NFL’s Super Bowl is arguably the biggest sporting event in the United States, drawing in well over 100 million viewers as the sport crowns its champion. As exciting as the football action is for viewers, though, the real big game exhilaration is felt directly by the pocketbooks and wallets of the hosting city. Being chosen as a Super Bowl Host city boasts numerous positives for the local economy as fans flood the area, and the NFL has events throughout the week leading up to the game. Below, we'll examine what’s considered when a Super Bowl host city is chosen, how a city benefits from hosting the big game, and which cities have already been chosen to host future Super Bowls. Here’s the list of all known future Super Bowl locations: Year Location 2025 Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, LA 2026 Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, CA 2027 SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, CA 2028 Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, GA Where Was the Super Bowl Held Last Season? Super Bowl LVII (58) occurred on Feb. 11, 2024, at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, NV. Nearly 62,000 fans attended the game. The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers, 25-22 in overtime. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes completed 34 of 46 passes for 333 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception. The game-winning touchdown was thrown to wide receiver Mecole Hardman. The Chiefs have now won three Super Bowls with Mahomes. As of Jan. 20, 2025, the Chiefs will host the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship for a trip to Super Bowl LIX. With a win at Super Bowl LIX, the Chiefs will become the first team to win three straight Super Bowls. How Big Was Last Year’s Super Bowl Audience? Over 123.4 million people watched Super Bowl LVIII, making it the most-watched TV program of all time. It beat out Super Bowl LVII, which set the record in 2023 with 115.1 million viewers. The cost of a 30-second commercial was $7 million. What Was the Biggest Super Bowl Audience Ever? Super Bowl LVIII drew 123.4 million viewers across all platforms, a 7% increase from Super Bowl LVII. This was the most viewed telecast of all time. There were 202.4 million viewers who watched some or all of the game. Univision, a Spanish-language network, drew 2.2 million viewers, which is a Super Bowl record. Is the Super Bowl the Biggest Sporting Event in the World? While the Super Bowl is the biggest sporting event in the US, it is not the case for the rest of the world. The World Cup Final is the most viewed event at a shocking five billion people. That event only occurs once every four years, but this figure still heavily outpaces the Super Bowl, which drew 123.4 million viewers. So, while it may not be the biggest in the world, it’s safe to say it’s the biggest in the NFL. Where Was the First Super Bowl Held? Super Bowl I occurred on Jan. 15, 1967, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. The capacity of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is 78,467. The 11-2-1 AFL Kansas City Chiefs took on the mighty 12-2 NFL Green Bay Packers in a game where the Packers were favored by 14. Under the leadership of Super Bowl MVP quarterback Bart Starr, the Green Bay Packers went on to win the matchup 35-10. What City has Hosted the Most Super Bowls? That honor currently goes to Miami, Florida, which has hosted eleven Super Bowls. That total is one more than New Orleans, LA, which currently has ten. Super Bowl LIX will be held at the Caesars Superdome. Here is a list of all the Super Bowl cities and the number of times each has hosted the big game: Miami (11) New Orleans (11) LA Metro Area (7) Tampa Bay (4) Phoenix (Metro) (4) San Diego (3) Houston (3) Detroit (Metro) (2) Atlanta (2) Minneapolis-Saint Paul (2) San Francisco (1) Santa Clara (1) Jacksonville (1) Dallas-Fort Worth (1) Indianapolis (1) NY Metro Area (1) Las Vegas (1) Which US State Has Hosted the Most Super Bowls? Florida has hosted the most Super Bowls, with 16. Of those 16, 11 have been in Miami and Miami Gardens. What Stadium Has Hosted the Most Super Bowls? First Place Miami and New Orleans have hosted the Super Bowl 11 times, but both cities have done it in two different locations. Overall, the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans has hosted the most, with eight, including Super Bowl LIX. Second Place Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, FL, comes in second with six Super Bowls. The first came in 1989, and the most recent was in 2020. Which Stadium Is Considered the All-Time Favorite Super Bowl Venue? While this is completely subjective, the Orange Bowl in Miami has hosted five significant matchups in NFL history. Super Bowl II – Green Bay Packers 33, Oakland Raiders 14 Super Bowl III – New York Jets 16, Baltimore Colts 7 Super Bowl V – Baltimore Colts 16, Dallas Cowboys 13 Super Bowl X – Pittsburgh Steelers 21, Dallas Cowboys 17 Super Bowl XIII – Pittsburgh Steelers 35, Dallas Cowboys 31 Fun facts: Super Bowls II and III are the only two Super Bowls to be played back-to-back years in the same stadium. Also, Super Bowl V was the first Super Bowl played on artificial turf. How Much Money Does a Host City Typically Make During the Super Bowl? Of course, that varies depending on the city, but let’s just say it’s millions of dollars. For example, according to Arizona State University’s L. William Seidman Institute, Super Bowl LVII (57) generated roughly $1.3 billion in the region. Then, in 2024, the Super Bowl LVIII generated about $1 billion, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority by Applied Analysis. Do Cities Still Bid to Host the Super Bowl? NFL owners usually meet in May to renegotiate how Super Bowl host cities are chosen. It’s reported that at that meeting, the league will “formally do away with allowing cities to bid for its marquee event.” A new selection process will replace bidding, one that involves the league negotiating a suitable deal with a hand-picked city. This is designed to give the NFL greater control over where its marquee event takes place year after year. What Are the Main Considerations When Choosing a Super Bowl Venue? According to Matt Shapiro, the vice president of events strategy for the NFL, here are the considerations when choosing a Super Bowl venue: They gauge interest from teams. Take into account “what might make sense for each year.” The league works with the Fan Engagement and Major Events Advisory Committee, which is a group of 11 teams and their owners, to review potential options. Ultimately, this goes to a vote amongst the owners. Other Factors That Matter When Choosing a Host City Warm vs. Cold Weather Weather is certainly a factor, as the Super Bowl isn’t just the game on Sunday, per Shapiro. “There’s a tremendous amount of events throughout the week.” Therefore, the weather could play a factor in accommodating those events. Stadium Quality While new stadiums are often immediately considered, Shapiro said that the committee will also consider areas where the Super Bowl has not been held for some time. Local Amenities With the Super Bowl come thousands of people who need a place to stay, eat and drink. Cities that can provide enough quality hotel rooms, restaurants, and nightclubs usually have the edge over the Super Bowl selection committee. Media, sponsors, fans, and the teams and their staff who will be playing in the game will book hotels at least a year in advance for multiple days, so if you’re in the service industry, it’s quite a financial boon to be able to count on an upcoming Super Bowl in your hometown. Local Partnerships Shapiro cited that the host city must be supported “politically, logistically, and otherwise.” Everyone involved needs to be on board with how massive the Super Bowl is. Where Is Super Bowl LIX Being Held? Super Bowl LIX (59) will be held on Sunday, Feb. 9, 2025, at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. Caesars Superdome holds 83,500 fans and has been the site of the Super Bowl eight times, including Super Bowl LIX. This will be the first Super Bowl in New Orleans since the Baltimore Ravens defeated the San Francisco 49ers in 2013 at Super Bowl XLVII. The stadium underwent a massive $292 million renovation in 2023. Have They Already Picked the Sites of Future Super Bowls? Yes, they have sites picked through the year 2027. 1. Super Bowl LIX (59) in 2025 Next season’s Super Bowl will be held at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, LA. The game will tie New Orleans with Miami as the cities that have hosted the most Super Bowls. New Orleans last hosted the Super Bowl back in 2013, when the Ravens beat the 49ers 34-31. 2. Super Bowl LX (60) in 2026 Super Bowl LX will take place at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, CA. The stadium in the Bay Area seats 68,500 fans. One interesting factor for this Super Bowl is that the San Francisco 49ers, who call Levi’s Stadium home, will likely be a favorite to make it to the game, even after a tough 2024 campaign. 3. Super Bowl LXI (61) in 2027 Super Bowl LXI will return to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, CA. The new stadium, which was built to host events like the Super Bowl, has a capacity of 70,000 and can be expanded to over 100,000. SoFi hosted its first Super Bowl in 2022 when the Los Angeles Rams won 23-20 at their home stadium. 4. Super Bowl LXI (62) in 2028 Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, will host the 62nd Super Bowl. The stadium has also been the site of one other Super Bowl, LIII, where the Patriots beat the Rams 13-3. It holds 71,000 fans. What Other Cities Could Hold the Super Bowl in the Distant Future? Las Vegas, NV The Oakland Raiders’ Las Vegas Stadium is hosting its first Super Bowl this season, but it won’t be their last. The stadium’s location on the famous Las Vegas Strip makes it appealing to fans across the country. The city is also the sports betting capital of the world, making it a popular destination even when the Super Bowl isn’t being played there. As long as this year’s game goes well, we expect to see the NFL’s biggest game return to the stadium for years to come. Orchard Park, New York While it could be a longshot, a new Buffalo Bills stadium will be built by 2026. It won’t have a dome, but with this being a new stadium, we could see a cold-weather Super Bowl, potentially with snow. Jacksonville, FL While the Jaguars aren’t getting a new stadium, they will be doing a mass renovation this season, which could appeal to the powers that be when deciding where the Super Bowl is held. Dallas, TX AT&T Stadium is still a marvel of a venue, and it’s home to “American’s Team,” the Dallas Cowboys. With Jerry Jones involved, the Super Bowl and the festivities leading up to it would provide an excellent experience for fans.
