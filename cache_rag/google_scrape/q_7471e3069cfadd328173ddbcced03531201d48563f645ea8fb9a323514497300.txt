Foreign-Made Films - Their Chances For                       Becoming Best Picture? Most foreign-made or foreign-language potential                     nominees for Best Picture have usually been relegated to                     the Best Foreign Language Film category, a newly-formed category                     for non-English speaking films that was first awarded for                   1956 films (at the 1957 Academy Awards ceremony). Since then,                   a number of foreign-language or foreign-made films have earned                   a Best Picture nomination, especially beginning in 2009 when                   the number of Best Picture nominees could possibly be 10: Z                   (1969, Fr./Alg.) , The                     Emigrants (1971/72, Swe.) , Cries & Whispers (1972,                       Swe.) , Il                         Postino (1994, It.) , Life Is Beautiful (1997,                         It.) , Crouching                           Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000, Taiwan/HK), Amour                           (2012, Fr.), Roma (2018, Mex.), Parasite (2019, S.                           Korea), Drive My Car (2021, Jp.) , All Quiet                           on the Western Front (2022, Germ.), The Zone of Interest                           (2023, UK), Emilia Pérez                     (2024, Fr.), and I'm Still Here (2024, Brazil). To date, the first and only nominated foreign-language                   film to have won the Best Picture Oscar was Parasite (2019). Most Likely to Be Nominated (or Win) for                   Best Picture: Serious dramas or social-problem films                     with weighty inspirational themes, biopics (inspired by real-life                     individuals or events), or films with literary pretensions                     are much more likely to be nominated (and win). Glossy, large-scale                     epic historical productions with big budgets (of various                     genres) have often taken the Best Picture prize. Likewise                     for studio pictures with big stars - they are much preferred                     over quirky independent films, although that trend has begun                     to change in recent years. Least Likely to Be Nominated                   (or Win) for Best Picture: Films not considered to have the stature                   of a Best Picture are often not nominated. Action-adventures,                   family-oriented animation, popular "popcorn" movies,                     suspense-thrillers, science-fiction, 'superhero' films, horror,                     comedies (including teen comedies), Westerns, foreign-language                     films, and spy thrillers are mostly overlooked, as are independent                     productions and children's films (although there have been                 a few exceptions). Other Factors That Make It                   More Likely For a Film to Receive a Nomination: The                     release date of the film (late in the year is best), whether                     or not it was distributed by a major studio, and whether                     the actors, writers, and directors of the film have previous                     Oscar nominations. Another factor is the theme or content                     of the film -- which is represented by the film's genre and                     its major plot keywords (such as "Pulitzer Prize-winning"                 or "family tragedy" or "race relations"). Best Picture Genre Biases Major Genre Categories Description and Examples Title Screen Silent Films The first (and                   only) silent film to win 'Best Picture' was Wings (1927/28) . The second, a modern-day mostly-'silent'                       film (a co-French and US production) with a soundtrack, The                     Artist (2011, Fr./US) , also won Best Picture. Silents Science-Fiction Films S cience-fiction                   films don't win the Best Picture award, although they                   have often dominated in the Visual and Special Effects and                   other technical categories in recent years, and often veer                   toward dramatic thrillers. Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022) is considered                       the first bona                         fide science-fiction                   film to be awarded Best Picture. There have only been a few nominated science-fiction                   films before 2009 - and none of them have won the top prize: A Clockwork                       Orange (1971) Star                       Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) E.T.:                       The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) 2001:                     A Space Odyssey (1968, UK) was not even nominated                     for Best Picture. Then, it was unheard of that two science-fiction                     films were nominated for Best Picture in 2009 (although                     there were 10 nominees): District                       9 (2009) Avatar                       (2009) Some would also include these pre-2009 films:                   hybrids of sci-fi films: The                             Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) ,                             an epic fantasy The Curious Case of Benjamin Button                           (2008) , a dramatic fantasy Other sci-fi films nominated for Best Picture                       since 2009 have included these few, although some purists                       would not include                     all of them: Inception                       (2010) Gravity (2013) Her (2013) Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) The                       Martian (2015) Arrival                         (2016) Don't Look Up (2021) Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022) Dune: Part One (2021) and Dune:                            Part Two (2024) The Substance (2024) -                     horror sci-fi Some have claimed that Best Picture-winner The                 Shape of Water (2017) was a sci-fi film, but it was really                 a romantic fantasy. Recently, so-called "superhero" films                     (often massive blockbusters) have rarely been Best Picture                     nominees (i.e., Black Panther (2018) ), and have mostly been                     relegated to technical and Visual/Special Effects categories,                     where they have found some success and Oscar wins. Sci-Fi Drama Films The most frequent                   Best Picture nominee and winner category has been the category                   of drama (many have also been social-issue films), with many                       'pure' examples noted here: Grand                       Hotel (1931/32) Cavalcade (1932/33) How                       Green Was My Valley (1941) The                       Lost Weekend (1945) The                     Best Years of Our Lives (1946) - a wartime drama Gentleman's Agreement (1947) Hamlet                       (1948) - an historical drama All the King's Men (1949) All                       About Eve (1950) On                     the Waterfront (1954) Marty (1955) -                     a romantic drama A                       Man For All Seasons (1966) - an historical drama Midnight                       Cowboy (1969) One                       Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) Kramer                       vs. Kramer (1979) Ordinary People (1980) Chariots                       of Fire (1981, UK) - a sports drama Terms of Endearment                     (1983) - (drama/serio-comedy) Rain Man (1988) Driving Miss Daisy (1989) - (drama/serio-comedy) Forrest Gump (1994) - a romantic                     drama American                       Beauty (1999) - (drama/serio-comedy) Million                       Dollar Baby (2004) - a sports drama Crash (2005) Argo                       (2012) 12 Years A Slave (2013) Spotlight                       (2015) Moonlight (2016) Nomadland (2020) Dramas Comedy Films It has been rare that                   light comedy films win the Best Picture Oscar. The following                   have been the only 'comedies' that have won Best Picture: It                       Happened One Night (1934) You Can't Take It With                       You (1938) Going My Way (1944) -                        a musical comedy Tom                       Jones (1963, UK) - an historical epic/comedy The Sting (1973) Annie                       Hall (1977) The Artist (2011, Fr./US) There are other borderline or hybrid-comedies                       (mixed with serious dramatic elements, known as serio-comedy                       or dramedy) that have won Best Picture, including: The                       Apartment (1960) Terms                       of Endearment (1983) Driving Miss Daisy (1989) Shakespeare in Love (1998) American Beauty (1999) Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of                           Ignorance) (2014) - a  romantic comedy-drama Green Book (2018) - a hybrid comedy-drama Anora (2024) - a hybrid comedy-drama Comedies Biopics Films inspired by                   real-life individuals (especially when they face adversity)                   usually do very well in terms of nominations, and often win                   - especially if they are of epic proportion or are intense                   character studies. Often they are combined with other genre                     categories: there are musical biopics, historical or epic                       biopics, dramatic biopics, war biopics, etc. Biopic winners of the Best Picture Academy                       Award have included: The Great Ziegfeld                       (1936) - a musical biopic The Life of                           Emile Zola (1937) - the first true biopic winner Lawrence                       of Arabia (1962) A Man for All Seasons                       (1966) - an historical-literary biopic Patton (1970) -                         a war biopic Chariots                       of Fire (1981) - a sports-drama biopic Gandhi (1982) -                     an historical-epic biopic Amadeus (1984) - a musical biopic Out                       of Africa (1985) The Last Emperor (1987) -                     an historical-epic biopic Braveheart (1995) -                         an historical-epic biopic A                       Beautiful Mind (2001) The King's                       Speech (2010) Green Book (2018) -                         a biographical drama (or dramedy) Oppenheimer (2023) Biopics Epics Films                     / Blockbusters Long (well over                       120 minutes), historical epics with big budgets and grand,                       large-scale production values have often been chosen as                       Best Picture, including: Mutiny on the Bounty                     (1935) - an adventure epic Gone                     With the Wind (1939) The Greatest Show on                       Earth (1952) - an adventure epic Ben-Hur                       (1959) Lawrence                       of Arabia (1962) - a biopic                       epic A Man for All Seasons (1966) -                         a literary epic The                       Godfather (1972) - a crime epic The                       Godfather Part II (1974) - a crime epic Recent                   winners among epics have included: Gandhi                     (1982) Out of Africa (1985) The                     Last Emperor (1987) Schindler's                     List (1993) Forrest                     Gump (1994) Braveheart (1995) The English Patient (1996) Titanic                     (1997) Gladiator (2000) Oppenheimer (2023) Epics War Films Epics War films, either                   epics or intimate dramas related to war-time, have done very                   well in Academy history.

Four of the ten Best Pictures                         in the 1960s were musicals (all based on previous Broadway                         hits). The musical to receive the most nominations                         was La La Land (2016) at 14 nominations - with                         six wins (but not Best Picture),                         followed by 13 nominations for Chicago                       (2002) -- with six wins, including Best Picture and                       Best Supporting Actress. Musicals Action - Adventure Films A very small                         number of                   pure adventure (or action) films have ever been voted as Best                   Picture, including: Mutiny on the                       Bounty (1935) - an historical-adventure The Greatest Show on Earth (1952) Around the World in 80 Days (1956) Dances With Wolves (1990) , a western-adventure                           film Titanic (1997) , a multi-hybrid,                         an action-adventure epic, as well as a disaster film                     and historical romance Conversely, lots of action-adventure nominees/losers                       in the Best Picture category have included: The                       Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) The                       Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) Airport (1970) Deliverance                       (1972) The Towering Inferno (1974) Jaws                       (1975) Raiders of the Lost                       Ark (1981) The Right Stuff (1983) The                       Mission (1986) The Fugitive (1993) Apollo                       13 (1995) Master and Commander: The Far Side                           of the World (2003) Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) The Revenant (2015) Adventure Horror / Thriller Films Although                       it has mostly been classified as a thriller and crime-drama,                       Jonathan Demme's film may take the claim of being the only                       'horror' movie to win Best Picture: The Silence of                             the Lambs (1991) The first                     true horror                     movie to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award                     was: The Exorcist (1973) It's amazing that a tremendous number of                       seminal horror-thriller films, including Frankenstein                         (1931) , Bride                         of Frankenstein (1935) , Cat                       People (1942) , Psycho                     (1960) , The Birds (1963) ,                     The Haunting (1963) , Rosemary's                     Baby (1968) , The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) , Carrie                     (1976), The Omen (1976), Halloween                         (1978) , Alien (1979) , The                           Shining (1980) , Poltergeist                           (1982) , A                           Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) , The                           Fly (1986) , and Misery (1990) - among others,                           were NOT nominated for Best Picture. [Note: Some of                           the above did receive nominations in other Oscar categories,                           with some winners among them.] In terms of the thriller genre category,                       there were no pure thrillers that were awarded Best                       Picture. Hitchcock's first US                     film and Best Picture winner Rebecca                       (1940) may be counted as the only winning                     suspense-thriller, although it has also been mostly classified                       as a romantic-drama plus mystery film. No                       Country For Old Men (2007) was                       a winning dramatic western crime-thriller. Ben Affleck's Argo (2012) was                     a suspenseful, historical docu-drama political thriller. And                       Best Picture-winning Parasite (2019, S.                         Korea) was                       a psychological thriller, twisting drama and dark                       comedy. Best Picture nominees in the suspense-thriller                     (and/or horror) genre have included: Suspicion (1941) Gaslight                     (1944) Spellbound (1945) The Exorcist (1973) Jaws                     (1975) Fatal Attraction (1987) The Sixth                     Sense (1999) Black Swan (2010) (a possibility) Get Out (2017) The Substance (2024) - the first "body                         horror" Best Picture nominee Horror Suspense-Thrillers Crime Films There have been                       only a few  crime films (all hybrids) that have won                       Best Picture: In                       the Heat of the Night (1967) - a crime/mystery                     (detective) drama The                       French Connection (1971) - both a crime film                       and action-thriller The                         Godfather (1972) and The                           Godfather, Part II (1974) -                           the two Francis Ford Coppola crime/drama gangster sagas/epics The                       Departed (2006) , a violent crime-drama-thriller Notable Best Picture- nominated crime                   films (often considered dramas) have included: The Racket (1928) Alibi                       (1928/29) I                       Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang (1932/33) Dead End                       (1937) The                       Maltese Falcon (1941) Bonnie                       And Clyde (1967) Chinatown                       (1974) Dog Day Afternoon (1975) Midnight                       Express (1978) Atlantic City (1981) Prizzi's                       Honor (1985) Mississippi Burning (1988) The                       Godfather: Part III (1990) GoodFellas                       (1990) Bugsy (1991) The Crying Game                       (1992) The Fugitive (1993) Pulp                       Fiction (1994) Fargo                       (1996) L.A.

Only one murder-mystery  film has                   ever won Best Picture, although it was really a hybrid crime-drama-thriller                   and civil-rights social issue film: In the Heat of the                       Night (1967) Two of Hitchcock's suspenseful Best Picture-nominated,                       noirish, romantic mystery thrillers were: Suspicion (1941) Spellbound (1945) Many other film noirish mysteries, thrillers                       and dramas have been nominated for Best Picture, although                       a number of them are composite hybrids, including: The                       Thin Man (1934) - a crime-mystery comedy Citizen                       Kane (1941) - a mystery drama The Maltese                       Falcon (1941) - a film noir detective mystery Double                       Indemnity (1944) - a noirish crime drama Gaslight (1944) -                       a film-noirish mystery-crime thriller Witness for the Prosecution                       (1957) - a courtroom mystery-crime drama Anatomy of a Murder (1959) -                     a courtroom mystery-crime drama Z (1969, Fr./Alg.) - an historical                     mystery-crime-thriller drama Chinatown                       (1974) - a neo-noirish detective crime mystery JFK (1991) - an historical mystery-thriller                         and drama L.A.

Seven prime examples  have                       included: Laura                       (1944) The                             Third Man                      (1949) Rear                       Window (1954) Murder on the Orient Express                       (1974) The Usual Suspects (1995) Memento (2000) The Constant Gardener (2005) Mystery Western Films Only four Westerns                   have won the highest honor: Cimarron                       (1930/31) Dances With Wolves (1990) Unforgiven                       (1992) No Country For Old Men (2007) -                         a dramatic western crime-thriller There have only been nineteen other nominated Westerns                         (in addition to the winners) for Best Picture, although                   many were hybrids. Many  would not consider                       some of these films as '  true' westerns: In                       Old Arizona (1928) - a romance western Viva Villa! (1934) - a biopic western Ruggles                       of Red Gap (1935) - a comedy romance in a western setting Stagecoach                       (1939) The Ox-Bow Incident                       (1943) - a dramatic western The                       Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) - an adventure                       western High                       Noon (1952) Shane                       (1953) Seven Brides for Seven Brothers                       (1954) - a musical western Friendly Persuasion (1956) -                       an historical western drama Giant                       (1956) - an epic, dramatic western The                       Alamo (1960) How the West Was Won (1963) Butch                       Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) - a biographical                       crime-western with some comedy Brokeback                       Mountain (2005) - a romantic drama in a western setting True Grit (2010) Django                       Unchained (2012) The Revenant                       (2015) - a dramatic adventure western Hell                       or High Water (2016) - a crime drama in a western setting Westerns Fantasy Films The                   Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) has                   been the                     first (and only) true fantasy film to win Best Picture. Also, the whimsical fantasy romantic-drama                       (hybrid) The Shape of Water (2017) has also won Best Picture. Fantasy-adventures rarely win                       the Best Picture award, although they have often dominated                       in the Visual and Special Effects technical categories                       in recent years. Many f antasy Best Picture nominees (some                       were hybrids) have lost, including: A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935) Lost                       Horizon (1937) The                       Wizard of Oz (1939) Here Comes Mr. Jordan                       (1941) Heaven Can Wait (1943) It's                       A Wonderful Life (1946) Dr.                       Strangelove, Or: (1964) A                       Clockwork Orange (1971) Heaven Can Wait (1978) E.T.:                       The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) The Green Mile                       (1999) The                       Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) The                       Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) The Curious Case of Benjamin Button                         (2008) Hugo (2011) Life of                       Pi (2012) Fantasy Animated Films Before 2001, the                   only animated film nominated for Best Picture was: Disney's Beauty                     and the Beast (1991) After the creation                     of the Best Animated Feature category in 2001, Beauty                       and the Beast (1991) was predicted to be the ONLY animated                     film ever nominated for Best Picture, until two other animations                       were also nominated for Best Picture: Up                       (2009) - the first animated film                       to receive a Best Picture nomination since animated films                       received their own category in 2001; it was also the                       first computer (or CG)-animated film to be Best                       Picture-nominated Toy                       Story 3 (2010) Winning                       films in this category of films are often huge blockbusters. Animated Children's Films (not including any Animated films) These are G-rated                   films specifically made for young kids (they are often appropriate                   for families and adults too). Often, they are nominated                   (or win) for various music-related categories.. They are rarely taken seriously, and therefore not                           often nominated for Best Picture, with the following                           exceptions: Skippy (1930/31) The                         Wizard of Oz (1939) The Yearling (1946) Miracle                         on 34th Street (1947) Mary Poppins (1964) Doctor                         Dolittle (1967) E.T.:                         The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) Babe (1995) Children's Sports Films Only a small number                   of sports/drama films have even received a nomination for                   Best Picture, let alone a Best Picture Oscar. Only three sports films (all dramas as well)                        have won Best Picture in Oscar history: Rocky                       (1976) Chariots of Fire (1981, UK) Million                       Dollar Baby (2004) Others that have received Best Picture nominations                       have included: The                       Champ (1931/32) The Pride of the Yankees (1942) The                       Hustler (1961) Heaven Can Wait (1978) Breaking                       Away (1979) Raging                       Bull (1980) Field of                       Dreams (1989) Jerry Maguire (1996) Seabiscuit                       (2003) The Fighter (2010) Moneyball (2011) Sports Romance Films Pure love stories                   (not including musicals) which often have strong romantic                   subplots are popular Best Picture winners and nominees during                   escapist periods in American history, such as the Depression                   Era and World War II, the 50's, and at the turn of the modern                   century. There are many examples of both                   romances and romantic comedies that have been nominated for                   Best Picture. Romance films (often hybrids with dramas                       or other categories) that have won Best Picture have included: Gone                       With the Wind (1939) Rebecca                       (1940) - a Gothic romance Mrs. Miniver (1942) Casablanca                         (1942/43) Marty (1955) -                         a romantic drama Out                         of Africa (1985) Forrest Gump (1994) - a romantic                       drama The English Patient (1996) Titanic                         (1997) Shakespeare in Love (1998) Slumdog                         Millionaire (2008) Anora (2024) - a                           hybrid romantic screwball-comedy/drama Light romantic comedies that have won Best                       Picture have included: It                       Happened One Night (1934) Annie                       Hall (1977) Romances Chick Flicks "Chick Flicks" (or                       'womens' pictures') have been around since the earliest                       days of cinema. The term generally refers to a sub-category                       of films that generally fall in the genres of Drama , Melodrama ,                       or Romance (see                       above), although they can appear in many other genre categories                       as well. Many so-called 'womens' pictures' have won                     the Best Picture Academy Award, including these examples: Grand                       Hotel (1932) It                     Happened One Night (1934) Gone                     With the Wind (1939) Rebecca                     (1940) How                       Green Was My Valley (1941) Mrs.                       Miniver (1942) Casablanca                     (1942/43) All                     About Eve (1950) Gigi (1958) West                     Side Story (1961) My                       Fair Lady (1964) The Sound of Music (1965) Annie                     Hall (1977) Kramer vs.                       Kramer (1979) Ordinary People (1980) Terms                       of Endearment (1983) Out of Africa (1985) Driving                       Miss Daisy (1989) The English Patient (1996) Shakespeare                       in Love (1998) Chicago (2002) Chick Flicks R-rated Films The first R-rated                   film to win Best Picture was The French                     Connection (1971) since the institution of the MPAA                   ratings system.

Actor                     Marlon Brando and director Bernard Bertolucci were also Oscar                     nominees for an X-rated film (not re-rated since its release),                       but it did not have a Best Picture nomination: Last                       Tango in Paris (1972) British (UK) Films Films with                   a British perspective, or with British/US production cooperation                   have done fairly well in the Best Picture category. Following is a list of the Best Picture-winning                         UK films (often co-produced with the US): Hamlet (1948) The                         Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) Lawrence                         of Arabia (1962) Tom Jones (1963) Oliver!
