Mayfield set the NFL rookie quarterback record for passing touchdowns during his first season, along with ending a 19-game winless streak for the Browns in his debut. His most successful season with the franchise was in 2020 when he led the Browns to their first playoff appearance since 2002 and first playoff victory since 1994.

[ 2 ] [ 7 ] James, a private equity consultant, encountered financial difficulties during his younger son's senior year in high school. These struggles forced the Mayfields to sell their home and live in rental homes. [ 7 ] Mayfield was given his distinctive name, Baker, which was his mother's idea, under the condition by his father that he also be named after the 40th U.S. President Ronald Reagan , which became his middle name. [ 8 ] Mayfield grew up as a fan of the University of Oklahoma ; he attended a number of their games during his childhood. [ 5 ] His father played football for three years for the University of Houston , though he never lettered .

[ 12 ] Mayfield was the first walk-on true freshman quarterback to start an FBS season opener at the quarterback position. [ 7 ] In his first start against SMU , Mayfield passed for 413 yards and four touchdowns. His 43 completions of 60 attempts broke a school record held by Billy Joe Tolliver , and fell only four completions short of the NCAA Division I FBS single-game record for completions by a freshman, held by Luke McCown . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] For his performance, Mayfield was named Big 12 Conference Offensive Player of the Week – the first freshman Texas Tech quarterback to be named so since former Red Raider head coach Kliff Kingsbury in 1999 . [ 15 ] The game featured the last four former Lake Travis quarterbacks combined on both teams: Garrett Gilbert , Michael Brewer, Collin Lagasse, and Mayfield. [ 16 ] Following the Red Raiders' second victory over Stephen F. Austin , Mayfield's 780 season yards and seven touchdowns already exceeded the 755 yards and six touchdowns accrued by Texas Tech's last true freshman quarterback, Aaron Keesee, in 10 games. [ 17 ] After being affected by a knee injury and losing the starting job to fellow true freshman Davis Webb , Mayfield finished the season with 2,315 yards on 218-of-340 completions with 12 touchdowns and 9 interceptions.

Mayfield further elaborated in an interview with ESPN that he sought to transfer due to scholarship issues and a perception that he had earned the starting position and that further competition was not "really fair". [ 4 ] [ 22 ] The alleged scholarship issues were denied by Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury. [ 23 ] In February 2014, Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops confirmed that Mayfield would be walking on for the Oklahoma Sooners . Mayfield was not eligible to play until the 2015 season, and he lost a season of eligibility due to Big 12 Conference transfer rules following an unsuccessful appeal of his transfer restrictions.

[ 32 ] In the rivalry game against Texas on October 8, he had 390 passing yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 45–40 victory. [ 33 ] On October 22, in a 66–59 victory over Texas Tech , Mayfield had 545 passing yards and seven touchdowns in a historic matchup against future NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes . Mahomes tallied 734 passing yards and five touchdowns to go along with Mayfield's numbers in a game that broke various single-game passing records. [ 34 ] Over the final five games of the regular season, Mayfield totaled 1,321 passing yards, 15 passing touchdowns, and three interceptions, to go along with three rushing touchdowns.

[ 37 ] In the 2017 Sugar Bowl, Mayfield helped lead the Sooners to a 35–19 victory over Auburn . He finished the game with 19 completions on 28 attempts for 296 passing yards and two touchdowns, earning him the MVP award. [ 38 ] 2017 season On September 9, 2017, after a win against the Ohio State Buckeyes in Columbus , Mayfield planted the Sooners ' flag in the middle of the painted "O" at Ohio Stadium , causing a major public backlash.

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] Mayfield completed his career 3–0 as the starting Oklahoma quarterback in the Bedlam Series . [ 42 ] Mayfield at 2017 Big 12 Media Days In November 2017, Mayfield was under fire again after an interaction during the game against Kansas . After Kansas players refused to shake his hand pregame, and following a cheap shot by a Kansas defender, Mayfield was seen grabbing his crotch and mouthing "Fuck you!" at the Kansas coach on the sideline, and told the fans to "Go cheer on basketball." [ 44 ] In response, Mayfield issued another public apology. [ 45 ] Days after the 41–3 victory over Kansas, Sooners head coach Lincoln Riley announced that Mayfield would not start or be the captain during the upcoming game against West Virginia due to his actions against Kansas. [ 46 ] On December 2, 2017, with the return of the Big 12 Championship Game after a six-year hiatus, [ 47 ] Mayfield led Oklahoma to its third straight Big 12 championship, with Oklahoma beating the TCU Horned Frogs 41–17.

[ 48 ] A month later, the Sooners lost to the Georgia Bulldogs 54–48 in the 2018 Rose Bowl , which served as the national semifinal game. [ 50 ] On December 9, 2017, Mayfield won the 2017 Heisman Trophy with a sweeping majority. [ 51 ] He received 732 first-place votes and a total of 2,398 points. [ 52 ] This amount translated to 86% of the possible points and the third highest percentage in Heisman history . [ 51 ] In addition, Mayfield became the first and only walk-on player to ever win the Heisman Trophy. [ 52 ] "Baker Mayfield rule" When Mayfield transferred from Texas Tech to Oklahoma after his freshman year, he filed an appeal to the NCAA to allow him to be eligible to play immediately at Oklahoma on the basis that he was a walk-on and not a scholarship player at Texas Tech; therefore, the transfer rules that apply to scholarship players should not be applicable to his situation. The NCAA denied his appeal as he did not meet the criteria. Big 12 Conference rules additionally stipulate that intra-conference transfers will lose one year of eligibility over and beyond the one-year sit-out imposed by the NCAA. [ 53 ] Mayfield attempted to appeal his initial loss of eligibility to the Big 12 Conference faculty athletics representatives but was denied in September 2014. [ 54 ] Officials from Oklahoma asked Texas Tech officials to authorize Mayfield's immediate eligibility, but Texas Tech officials objected and declined the request before granting a release in July 2014. [ 55 ] Mayfield was thus forced to sit out the 2014 season , while also losing one year of eligibility, as required by the rules. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] On June 1, 2016, the Big 12 faculty athletic representatives voted against a rule proposal that would have allowed walk-on players to transfer within the conference and not lose a year of eligibility. The next day, the rule proposal was amended to allow walk-on players, without a written scholarship offer from the school they are transferring from, to transfer within the conference without losing a season of eligibility. The faculty athletic representatives approved the amended proposal with a vote of 7–3. The rule change made Mayfield eligible to play for Oklahoma through the 2017 season. Texas Tech voted in favor of the rule.

As reported by The Plain Dealer , Mayfield "pretended to expose his private parts" to Browns offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens after throwing a touchdown to tight end Darren Fells . Kitchens later defended the gesture as an inside joke between the two. Mayfield's agent Tom Mills said they would appeal the fine. [ 75 ] On December 30, in the regular-season finale against the Ravens' league-best defense and fellow rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson , Mayfield threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns, but his three costly interceptions — one of which came at the hands of linebacker C. J. Mosley with 1:02 left in the fourth quarter while attempting to drive the team into range of a game-winning field goal attempt — ultimately contributed to a 26–24 loss.

[ 82 ] After the blowout loss, Mayfield said, "I just think everybody just needs to be more disciplined. I think everybody knows what the problem is. We'll see if it's just bad technique or just see what it is. Dumb penalties hurting ourself and then penalties on my part. Just dumb stuff."

[ 127 ] Mayfield suffered a high-ankle sprain in the Panthers' Week 5 loss to the 49ers, which made him miss the next week against the Los Angeles Rams . [ 128 ] Mayfield returned and backed up P. J. Walker starting in Week 8. In the Week 9 game against the Bengals, the Panthers were trailing 35–0 at halftime behind a disastrous start by Walker; Interim Head Coach Steve Wilks inserted Mayfield for the second half, in which he threw for 155 yards and two touchdowns in the 42–21 loss. [ 129 ] Wilks announced that he would return to Walker as his starting quarterback for Week 10. [ 130 ] With a 1–5 record, Mayfield later requested his release from the Panthers, which was granted on December 5, 2022. [ 131 ] Los Angeles Rams See also: 2022 Los Angeles Rams season On December 6, 2022, Mayfield was claimed off waivers by the Rams after starting quarterback Matthew Stafford sustained a spinal cord injury on December 2. [ 132 ] The Rams inherited the remaining $1.35 million on his contract. [ 133 ] With only two days for Mayfield to learn the playbook after he was claimed, the Rams started John Wolford at quarterback for their game against the Las Vegas Raiders . Rams' head coach Sean McVay benched Wolford after the first offensive series, though, and inserted Mayfield. The Rams were trailing 16–3 in the fourth quarter, seemingly headed for their seventh consecutive loss, when Mayfield led them on a comeback. With 1:45 remaining in the game, still down by 6 points, and with no timeouts left to use, the Rams' offense took the field at their own two-yard line. Mayfield then led the Rams to a game-winning 98-yard drive, which became the longest touchdown drive of his career. [ 134 ] [ 135 ] Mayfield completed 22 of 35 passes for 230 yards without an interception in the game and was named the National Football Conference Offensive Player of the Week. [ 136 ] In a Week 15 Monday Night Football matchup against the Green Bay Packers , Mayfield threw his 100th career passing touchdown. [ 137 ] In a Week 16 matchup against the Broncos, Mayfield led the Rams to a dominant 51–14 win while completing 24 of 28 pass attempts for 230 yards and throwing for two touchdowns. [ 138 ] Mayfield would later credit his five-game stint with the Rams for rejuvenating his career following the disappointment of his time with Carolina. “It brought the fun back. When I’m having fun, talking trash, and enjoying it, like that’s when I’m my best. Yeah, I needed that,” Mayfield said. [ 139 ] Tampa Bay Buccaneers 2023 season See also: 2023 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season On March 15, 2023, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed Mayfield to a one-year, $4.00 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $2.87 million. [ 140 ] Mayfield was brought in to compete against Kyle Trask and John Wolford to determine who would be the successor at starting quarterback to Tom Brady after he retired after the 2022 NFL season. [ 141 ] In Week 1 against the Minnesota Vikings , Mayfield went 3 for 11 to start the game, but soon thereafter threw a touchdown to end the first half. After that, Mayfield went 18/23 for 110 yards and a touchdown for the rest of the game, including a crucial scramble for a first down to secure a 20–17 victory. [ 142 ] In Week 2 against the Chicago Bears , Mayfield went 26 for 34 for 317 yards and one touchdown in a 27–17 win. His 76% completion percentage for this game narrowly marked the best completion rate of his career at that point, in any of 33 games with 33+ pass attempts. Before that, his 75.8% completion rate on December 6, 2020, in a win against the Titans while on the Browns, had been his highest completion rate. This was also the first time in his career that Mayfield had started 2–0. [ 143 ] In Week 3 against the Philadelphia Eagles , Mayfield went 15/25 for 146 yards, with one touchdown and one interception, his first turnover of the season. He had one rush for 2 yards and fumbled once, which was recovered by Tampa Bay. Mayfield was also sacked twice. [ 144 ] In Week 15 against the Packers, Mayfield posted a perfect passer rating , completing 22 of 28 passes for 381 yards and four touchdowns in a 34–20 win. [ 145 ] He was the first opposing quarterback to ever have a perfect passer rating at Lambeau Field . [ 146 ] He was named the National Football Conference (NFC) Offensive Player of the Week for this performance. [ 147 ] In Week 18 against the Panthers, Mayfield led the Buccaneers to a 9–0 victory, clinching the Buccaneers' third straight NFC South title. [ 148 ] Mayfield concluded the season with 28 touchdown passes, 4,044 passing yards and a 64.3% completion rate, all career highs. [ 149 ] He earned his first Pro Bowl nomination. [ 150 ] In the Wild Card Round game against the Eagles, Mayfield completed 22 of 36 passes, for 337 yards, with three touchdowns and no interceptions. He led the Buccaneers to a 32–9 win over the defending NFC champions. [ 151 ] In the Divisional round against the Detroit Lions , Mayfield completed 26 of 41 passes for 349 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. The second interception proved costly as it allowed the Lions to run out the clock as the Buccaneers lost, 31–23. [ 152 ] 2024 season See also: 2024 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season On March 10, 2024, Mayfield signed a three-year contract extension with the Buccaneers, worth up to $100 million, with $50 million guaranteed. [ 153 ] In Week 1, Mayfield went 24-of-30 for 289 yards and four touchdowns in a 37–20 win over the Commanders. [ 154 ] In a rematch of last season's Divisional round playoff game, Mayfield completed 12 passes for 185 yards and ran for a go-ahead touchdown as the Buccaneers beat the Lions 20–16. [ 155 ] After a poor performance against the Denver Broncos , Mayfield rebounded the following week against the Eagles, throwing for 347 yards and accounting for three touchdowns as Tampa improved to 3–1. [ 156 ] In Week 5 against the Falcons, Mayfield threw three touchdown passes in the first half, but a lack of efficiency on offense in the second half cost the Buccaneers as they lost in overtime. [ 157 ] In Week 6, Mayfield threw for 325 yards, four touchdown passes, and overcame three interceptions in the second quarter to win 51–27 against the Saints, leading the offense to a franchise record 594 yards. [ 158 ] In a 41–31 loss to the Baltimore Ravens in Week 7, Mayfield threw for 370 yards and three touchdowns, but he threw a pair of costly interceptions in the first half and lost receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin , the latter of whom ruled out for the season. [ 159 ] Without his top receivers, Mayfield still completed a career-high 37 passes the following week against the Falcons. [ 160 ] He finished with over 300 yards and three touchdowns for the third straight game but threw two interceptions inside the Falcons' 10-yard line as the Buccaneers lost 31–26. [ 161 ] Mayfield cut down on his interception miscues and led last-minute game-tying drives against the Chiefs and 49ers, but the Buccaneers lost both games, dropping to 4–6 heading to their bye week. [ 162 ] With the return of Mike Evans following the bye, Mayfield had an efficient game against the Giants, completing 24 of 30 passes for 294 yards, no interceptions, and a rushing touchdown as the Bucs won 30–7, snapping their four-game skid. [ 163 ] Against the Panthers in Week 13, Mayfield rallied from an Achilles injury and a poor first half to lead Tampa to a game-winning field goal drive in overtime. [ 164 ] Mayfield's play continued to improve with three touchdowns in a win over the Las Vegas Raiders , followed by a near-flawless performance against the league's top-ranked Los Angeles Chargers defense, completing 22-of-27 passes for 288 yards and four touchdowns in a 40–17 victory. [ 165 ] In Week 17, Mayfield was 27-for-32 for 359 yards and a career-high five touchdown passes in a 48–14 win over the Panthers, earning NFC Offensive Player of the Week. [ 166 ] Needing a win against the Saints to clinch the NFC South, Mayfield led three touchdown drives in the second half and rallied his team from a double-digit deficit to secure their fourth straight division title. [ 167 ] Mayfield finished the season completing 71.4% of his passes for 4,500 yards and 41 passing touchdowns, becoming the fourth player in NFL history to have at least 4,000 passing yards, 40 passing touchdowns, and at least a 70% completion percentage in a single season. [ 168 ] Mayfield helped lead the Buccaneers to a playoff berth. In the NFC Wild Card Round , Mayfield led two touchdown drives and two drives that ended in a field goal. In that game, Mayfield threw for 185 yards completing 83.3% of his passes. [ 169 ] The Buccaneers' season ended in the Wild Card Round with a 23–20 loss to the Washington Commanders.

The preliminary police report described Mayfield as unable to walk straight, having slurred speech and food covering the front of his shirt. When he was asked to stay so the police could get a statement, Mayfield began shouting obscenities and "causing a scene". Mayfield was booked at 8:21 a.m. local time on the misdemeanor charges.
