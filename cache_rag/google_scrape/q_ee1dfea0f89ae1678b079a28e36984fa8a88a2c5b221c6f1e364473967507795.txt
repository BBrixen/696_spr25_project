Can you believe that we’re officially in the second half of 2021 and that Christmas is closer to us than New Year’s 2021? Madness! June 2021 was a hive of activity in the LEGO world, with all the new Summer 2021 releases being set upon our poor wallets which are still recovering from the first half of 2021. Unless you’re in North America where you have to wait till August 2021 for all the new goodies. We had 2 big releases in June 2021 – two of which are LEGO models of inanimate objects – 21327 Typewriter and 10282 Adidas Superstar ! To help you catch up on all the new and LEGO headlines, here’s a handy recap of all the news, reviews from this blog, and the broader LEGO Fan Media Community. If you want to catch up on previous Power Rankings , check out May , April , March, February and January 2021 Power Rankings to get up to speed on highlights from the first 5 months of 2021. June 2021 LEGO Power Rankings With a ton of new releases, and some really sensational sets the June 2021 Power Rankings has been given a bit of a shakeup, and sees a ton of movement. Without further ado, here are my Top 10 LEGO sets as of June 2021! Top 10 LEGO sets as of June 2021 21326 Winnie the Pooh [ Review ] [ Rating: 5/5  ★★★★★] 10281 Bonsai Tree 80107 Spring Lantern Festival [ Review ] [ Rating: 5/5  ★★★★★] 40516 Everyone is Awesome [ Review ] [ Rating: 5/5  ★★★★★] *NEW* 21327 Typewriter *NEW* 21325 Medieval Blacksmith ⬇️ 76178 Daily Bugle ⬇️ 10283 NASA Space Shuttle Discovery ⬇️ 71741 Ninjago City Gardens 31120 Medieval Castle [ Review ] [ Rating: 4/5  ★★★★★] *NEW* This was a pretty hard one with so many great new releases that I had to factor into the Power Rankings, with 2 new debuts in the top 5 – 40516 Everyone is Awesome and 21327 Typewriter . It was a no-brainer to acknowledge the extra-ordinary impact of Everyone is Awesome , which is perhaps the most talked about LEGO set in and outside the LEGO fan community, and the sublime combination of form and function of the Typewriter earned it a spot in the Top 5. Rounding up the new debuts is the Creator 3-in-1 Medieval Castle at number 10, which I had a lot of fun with. Leaving the Top 10 is 10280 Flower Bouquet , 10278 Modular Police Station and 75308 R2-D2 – a fond farewell to these otherwise excellent sets, but the shiny-ness and uniqueness of the June releases pipped them off the charts. Who knows – they might make a return! What are Power Rankings? Essentially, they’re commonly used in sports leagues like the NBA to track and compare the best/worst performing teams, often changing weekly based on results and how teams play. I often get asked via email or on social media what the best sets of the (insert current) year/month are, and I usually rattle off what I personally like, so to start 2021, I’ve decided to start a regular series where I track and rank what the best 10 LEGO sets are at the end of each month. This isn’t meant to be scientific or data-driven (some of these I haven’t personally built/own yet) – just my personal opinion of what I think are the best LEGO sets of 2021! Of course, for a more comprehensive evaluation of LEGO sets, you can read my LEGO reviews for more detailed opinions. For sets that I’ve reviewed, I’ll also include the scores next to the power rankings, but it’s quite unlikely that I’ll get to review every amazing set of 2021 – I sometimes build and miss out reviewing due to time/scheduling issues.

The fun of lego is the story we create as we build and play. The rosebud motel would have been a real message of everyone is awesome. And go ahead and include the rainbow set for fun. But lego and community sent a big message when they dropped that build. Seriously do not understand it and think they have missed an opportunity. Just my opinion and disappointment since I’d at least like to see the dis at least discussed as to the why.
