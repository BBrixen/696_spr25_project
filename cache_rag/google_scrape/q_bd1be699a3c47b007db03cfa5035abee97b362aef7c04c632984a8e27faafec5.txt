In September 2022, the Academy hired television producers Glenn Weiss and Ricky Kirshner to oversee production of the 2023 ceremony. [ 25 ] AMPAS president Janet Yang and CEO Bill Kramer remarked that they looked "to deliver an exciting and energized show" with Weiss and Kirshner. [ 26 ] Two months later, comedian and talk show host Jimmy Kimmel was announced as host of the gala. "Being invited to host the Oscars for a third time is either a great honor or a trap," Kimmel stated in a press release regarding his selection. "Either way, I am grateful to the Academy for asking me so quickly after everyone good said no", he concluded. [ 27 ] Furthermore, AMPAS announced that all 23 categories would be presented live during the gala. The announcement came in response to an internal survey which indicated negative feedback regarding the previous year's decision to present eight below-the-line categories prior to the live portion of last year's gala . [ 28 ] In light of the Chris Rock–Will Smith slapping incident during the previous year's telecast, AMPAS announced that the organization hired a "crisis team" in the event a similar altercation or if an unexpected fiasco arose. [ 29 ] In an interview published by Time magazine, Kramer explained: "We have a whole crisis team, something we've never had before, and many plans in place. We've run many scenarios. So it is our hope that we will be prepared for anything that we may not anticipate right now but that we're planning for just in case it does happen." [ 30 ] The Dolby Theatre stage on the day of the ceremony Several others participated in the production of the ceremony and related events. Rickey Minor served as musical director for the ceremony. [ 31 ] Production designers Misty Buckley and Alana Billingsley, who were the first women-led design team for an Oscars telecast, designed a new stage for the show. [ 32 ] According to Buckley and Billingsley, the stage was designed to resemble Art Deco movie places from the Golden Age of Hollywood . [ 33 ] Additionally, the set utilized several LED panels that were used to display the category names, winners' names, or images from the nominated films. [ 34 ] Notably, the arrivals area along Hollywood Boulevard outside the Dolby Theatre was lined with a champagne-colored carpet, marking the first time since the 32nd ceremony in 1960 that a non-red colored carpet was utilized for the gala. According to red carpet consultant Lisa Love, the production team chose a lighter shade of carpet color in order to not clash with a sienna-colored tent erected to shield attendees from the sun or potential rain. She also added that the shades of color for both the carpet and tent were inspired by "watching the sunset on a white-sand beach at the 'golden hour' with a glass of champagne in hand, evoking calm and peacefulness". [ 35 ] Lady Gaga was initially not scheduled to perform her nominated song " Hold My Hand " from Top Gun: Maverick due to prior commitments involving her role in Joker: Folie à Deux . On the morning of the ceremony, however, it was reported that Gaga would perform at the ceremony. [ 36 ] Meanwhile, actress Glenn Close , who was originally scheduled as a presenter during the gala, canceled her appearance due to a positive COVID-19 test. [ 37 ] Box office performance of Best Picture nominees [ edit ] When the nominations were announced, nine of the ten films nominated for Best Picture had earned a combined gross of $1.57 billion at the American and Canadian box offices at the time. Top Gun: Maverick was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $718.7 million in domestic box office receipts. [ 38 ] Avatar: The Way of Water came in second with $598.4 million; this was followed by Elvis ($151 million), Everything Everywhere All at Once ($70 million), The Fabelmans ($15 million), The Banshees of Inisherin ($9 million), Tar ($5.6 million), Triangle of Sadness ($4.2 million), and Women Talking ($1.1 million). The box office figures for All Quiet on the Western Front were unavailable due to their distributor Netflix 's policy of refusing to release such figures. [ 39 ] Furthermore, by virtue of Avatar: The Way of Water and Top Gun: Maverick' s Best Picture nominations, it marked the first time since the 55th ceremony in 1983 that the two highest grossing films of the year were both nominated in the aforementioned category. [ 40 ] Andrea Riseborough's nomination and controversy [ edit ] Andrea Riseborough 's Best Actress nomination for To Leslie was controversial amongst critics and pundits, as Momentum Pictures , the film's distributor, did not fund a conventional advertising-driven awards campaign for the film. Instead, director Michael Morris and his wife, actress Mary McCormack , organized a "celeb-backed campaign" to get Riseborough nominated. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] They contacted friends and colleagues in the entertainment industry, asking them to view the film and share it with others if they enjoyed it. [ 43 ] Morris and Riseborough also hired publicists to coordinate the efforts. While not initially regarded as a serious contender, the campaign raised Riseborough's profile; dozens of celebrities praised her performance on social media, and some hosted screenings of the film during voting for the Academy Award nominations in January 2023. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Riseborough's nomination was announced on January 24, which the Los Angeles Times called "one of the most shocking nominations in Oscar history". [ 43 ] After her nomination was announced, speculation arose that the tactics might have violated AMPAS rules against directly lobbying voters. [ 46 ] A post on the film's Instagram account was noted by several AMPAS members for possibly violating a rule prohibiting "[singling] out 'the competition' by name" by featuring a quote from film critic Richard Roeper , who praised Riseborough's performance as better than Cate Blanchett 's in Tár , a fellow nominee for Best Actress. [ 47 ] On January 27, the Academy announced a review of the year's campaigns "to ensure that no guidelines were violated, and to inform us whether changes to the guidelines may be needed in a new era of social media and digital communication". [ 48 ] The Academy has rescinded nominations for nominees who participated in unsanctioned campaigning. However, there were no reports that Riseborough had been involved in such, or that any Academy members had lodged formal complaints about the campaign's behavior. [ 48 ] On January 31, the Academy concluded its review by pledging to address "social media and outreach campaigning tactics" which they said caused "concern", but confirming that Riseborough's nomination would be retained. [ 49 ] Following the controversy, the Academy introduced new campaigning rules and clarifications in May 2023. [ 50 ] Critical reviews [ edit ] Variety columnist Owen Gleiberman wrote: "It didn't rock the boat, it didn't overstay its welcome, and it left you feeling that the world's preeminent awards show, all doom-saying punditry to the contrary, is still, on balance, a very good thing." He also added that the wins received by Everything Everywhere All at Once "lent the evening a rare emotional unity". [ 51 ] Television critic Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter similarly praised the show's emotional beats and found its flaws "were mitigated more gracefully than just about any Oscars telecast" he could recall. [ 52 ] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle commended Kimmel's stint as host stating: "He was establishing that 2023 would not be a repeat of 2022 — and it wasn't. It was such a relief to see something, anything, actually get better." [ 53 ] Mike Hale of The New York Times remarked on "the ordinariness and sameness of the ABC broadcast" compared to the prior year, [ 54 ] while USA Today ' s Kelly Lawler criticized it as "terribly fake" and felt that Kimmel's role "felt phoned in, or at least maybe monitored by corporate overlords looking to avoid controversy" despite some of his jokes tackling controversial subjects such as the January 6 United States Capitol attack and Tom Cruise 's Scientology advocacy. [ 55 ] Hale added that "the modern Oscars have become something more to be endured than enjoyed". [ 54 ] Ratings and reception [ edit ] The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 18.75 million people over its length, which was a 13% increase from the previous year's ceremony and marked the first time that the Academy Awards experienced consecutive years of viewership increase since the 86th Academy Awards in 2014. [ 3 ] The show also earned higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 9.9% of households watching the ceremony. [ 56 ] In addition, it garnered a higher 18–49 demo rating with a 4.03 rating among viewers in that demographic. [ 57 ] It was the most-watched prime time entertainment broadcast of 2023 in the United States. [ 58 ] In July 2023, the broadcast was nominated for three awards at the 75th Primetime Creative Arts Emmys but failed to win in any of the categories for which it was nominated. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] "In Memoriam" [ edit ] The annual "In Memoriam" segment was introduced by John Travolta . Singer Lenny Kravitz performed his song " Calling All Angels " during the tribute.

[ 12 ] ^ Many consider Merle Oberon , who was nominated for her role in The Dark Angel (1935), to be the first Asian nominee in this category, but she hid her mixed-race heritage due to fears regarding discrimination and the impact it would have on her career.
