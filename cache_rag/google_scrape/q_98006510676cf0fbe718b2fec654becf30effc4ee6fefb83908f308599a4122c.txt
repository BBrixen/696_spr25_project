Discussion I think salmon run as a whole in Splatoon 3 isn't being given enough attention by Nintendo. Some areas I think they can improve upon overall: 1:The damage and speed some of the lesser salmonids have is a bit unfair sometimes. 2: Since Salmon Run is now 24/7, it doesn't make sense to only have 2 superbonuses, and they should increase the # of bonus capsules per rotation. 3: They should have had more than just three stages at launch, I'm fine with the two new stages but they only ported one stage from splatoon 2 at launch which feels lazy to me. 4: Coho reward rates. Need I say more? 5: Big Run being advertised more heavily than Splatfest and then being more underwhelming than Splatfest is ironic 6: Let us save replays of salmon run shifts like we can with battle replays 7: While Cohozuna is fun and a great addition, why does the coho meter reset at the start of each rotation?
