Research [ edit ] Wiz researchers have discovered and publicly disclosed numerous cloud vulnerabilities that garnered significant media coverage: ChaosDB – A series of flaws in Microsoft Azure 's Cosmos DB that made it possible to download, delete, or manipulate databases belonging to thousands of Azure customers. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] OMIGOD – Bugs in Open Management Infrastructure (OMI), a ubiquitous but poorly documented agent embedded in many popular Azure services, that allowed for unauthenticated remote code execution and privilege escalation. [ 27 ] NotLegit – Insecure default behavior in the Azure App Service that exposed the source code of some customer applications. [ 28 ] ExtraReplica –  A chain of critical vulnerabilities found in the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server that could let malicious users escalate privileges and gain access to other customers' databases after bypassing authentication. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] AttachMe – A cloud isolation vulnerability that, before it was patched by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, could have allowed attackers to access and modify other users' OCI storage volumes without authorization. [ 31 ] Hell's Keychain – A first-of-its-kind cloud service provider supply-chain vulnerability in IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL that, before it was patched, could have allowed malicious actors to remotely execute code in victims' environments. [ 32 ] BingBang – A misconfiguration in Azure Active Directory (AAD) that allowed Wiz researchers to modify Bing.com search results in a way that malicious actors could use to steal Office 365 credentials granting access to countless users' private emails and documents.
