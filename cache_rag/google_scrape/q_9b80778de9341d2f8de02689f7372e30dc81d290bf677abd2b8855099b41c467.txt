She is the current manager of Nintendo 's Entertainment Planning & Development (EPD) Production Group No. 5, which oversees the Animal Crossing , Splatoon , and Wii Sports franchises. Kyogoku is best known for her work on Animal Crossing , where she has alternately served as a producer, director, and supervisor since 2008. Career [ edit ] Kyogoku began her career in 2000 at the video game company Atlus before joining Nintendo in September 2003. [ 1 ] [ 3 ] While at Atlus, she served as an Assistant Planner for the Dreamcast title deSPIRIA and Assistant Director for the PlayStation 2 title Wizardry: Tale of the Forsaken Land before moving to Nintendo. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] At Nintendo, Kyogoku worked as a scriptwriter on The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess , work for which she won a Game Developers Choice Award . [ 1 ] [ 6 ] In 2008, she worked as a sequence director on Animal Crossing: City Folk , where she was responsible for script writing and all elements relating to non-player character behavior and dialogue. [ 1 ] [ 7 ] Kyogoku and Isao Moro jointly served as directors of Animal Crossing: New Leaf , the 2012 sequel to City Folk . [ 8 ] Following the mixed critical and commercial performance of City Folk , Kyogoku sought to "get back to the series' roots" in New Leaf . [ 9 ] In 2015, Kyogoku produced the Animal Crossing spin-off title Happy Home Designer . [ 10 ] In 2019, she was named as Manager of Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development (EPD) Production Group No. 5, a position previously held by Hisashi Nogami before he was promoted at Deputy General Manager of Nintendo EPD. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] She directed Animal Crossing: New Horizons , the fifth main series title in the Animal Crossing series, in 2020. [ 1 ] Following the extensive critical and commercial success of New Horizons , Kyogoku has received media attention from both video-game and non-video-game media outlets alike, being dubbed “Nintendo’s Rising Star and Secret Weapon.” [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Serving as the director of Animal Crossing: New Leaf , Kyogoku became the first woman to direct a video game at Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development (EAD). [ 1 ] [ 11 ] After noting that she was frequently the only woman on development teams, Kyogoku and New Leaf producer Katsuya Eguchi hired a team that was half female; Kyogoku also encouraged all individuals on the development team to contribute ideas for the game, regardless of their role on the project. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Kyogoku credits the diversity of the team for New Leaf 's critical and commercial success, [ 1 ] [ 16 ] stating that "when you are trying to create something that will appeal to many types of people, I have experienced how beneficial it is to have diversity on your team" [ 9 ] and “it is very exciting to be able to have different types of people on the development team.” [ 17 ] When asked for a message to women who would like to work in the game industry during a Nintendo Developer Chat, Kyogoku responded, “if you want to, please join! I’ll be so happy if we can work together.” [ 17 ] Furthermore, Kyogoku has been praised for broadening the series' appeal "beyond the typical teenage-male demographic.” [ 12 ] Notably, Animal Crossing: New Horizons expanded visibility and representation through increased character customization options, including skin tone options and gender-neutral hairstyles that the player can switch between freely. Kyogoku explained that these options are "not just about gender," but rather the sentiment that "society is shifting to valuing a lot of people's different identities." [ 13 ] She explained further that “we basically wanted to create a game where users didn't really have to think about gender or if they wanted to think about gender, they're also able to."
