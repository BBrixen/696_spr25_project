Why is it on Sunday? By Meghan O'Keefe Twitter @ megsokay Published Nov. 16, 2019, 11:00 a.m. ET Photo: Netflix Where to Stream: The Crown Powered by Reelgood More On: The Crown New On Netflix April 2025, Plus What’s Coming Next 'Adolescence' and 'A Thousand Blows' Star Erin Doherty on Crafting Two of 2025's Best Performances: "There Is No Black and White" 'Grotesquerie' Star Lesley Manville Talks The "Utopia" Of Playing Two Characters For Ryan Murphy ‘Masterpiece’ Chief Susanne Simpson Teases the Future of the PBS Franchise — And Weighs in on Those ‘Sanditon’ Rumors Hail to the Queen, The Crown Season 3 is almost here! Netflix’s grand, soapy look at the lives and loves of Queen Elizabeth II’s royal court is mixing things up this season. To mark the passing of time, most of the cast has been replaced by an older generation of actors. Emmy winner Claire Foy is passing the role of Elizabeth II to Oscar winner Olivia Colman , Matt Smith is handing Prince Philip to Tobias Menzies , and Vanessa Kirby’s Princess Margaret will now be brought to vivid life by Helena Bonham Carter . The Crown Season 3 will delve into some of the most dramatic controversies to hit the Royal Family. Elizabeth and Philip will try to court the public’s approval with a risky behind-the-scenes documentary (that has since been banned from being aired), while the younger generation of royals struggle to find their own place in the shadow of their powerful mother. Here’s everything you need to know about The Crown Season 3 ahead of its release date. What is The Crown Season 3’s Release Date? What Time is The Crown Season 3 on Netflix? The Crown Season 3 will premiere on Netflix on Sunday, November 17, 2019. Like most all other Netflix originals, The Crown Season 3 will be available to stream at 3 AM EST, or 12 AM PST. Why is The Crown Season 3 Premiering on a Sunday? Good question! Traditionally, Netflix likes to premiere their big original hits on Fridays, but The Crown Season 3 is debuting on a Sunday. There doesn’t seem to be a clear answer for this unique programming shift, but Netflix has been experimenting a lot with scheduling premieres on days other than Fridays. However, there are practical reasons to push The Crown Season 3 to Sunday. After all, both Apple TV+ and Disney+ are premiering their originals on Friday. By pushing The Crown to Sunday, November 17, Netflix is giving one of their most celebrated hits some breathing room in a crowded week for streaming. Then again, there’s a strategic reason why Netflix might be moving The Crown ‘s debut to Sunday. Traditionally, Sunday night is the home of major prestige TV events. Everything from Mad Men to Game of Thrones to Masterpiece Theatre have made Sunday their home. Netflix is confidently asserting that The Crown also deserves to be thought of in this light. Who’s Who in The Crown Season 3? Who is in The Crown Season 3 Cast? Olivia Colman replaces Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth II. Tobias Menzies replaces Matt Smith as Prince Philip. Helena Bonham Carter replaces Vanessa Kirby as Princess Margaret. Ben Daniels replaces Matthew Goode as Anthony Armstrong-Jones. Jason Watkins plays Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Erin Doherty plays Princess Anne. Josh O’Connor plays Prince Charles. Emerald Fennell plays Camilla Shand (aka Camilla Parker-Bowles). The Crown Season 3 premieres on Netflix on Sunday, November 17.
