He is the current manager of Atlético Madrid B . Due to his consistent goalscoring as a young player, Torres came to be nicknamed El Niño ('The Kid'), which stuck with him throughout his career. [ 5 ] In his prime, he was known for his pace, prolific goalscoring, and heading . Torres started his career with Atlético Madrid , progressing through their youth system to the first team. He made his debut in 2001 and left the club with 75 goals in 174 La Liga appearances. Torres joined Premier League club Liverpool in 2007 and became the fastest player in Liverpool history to score 50 league goals. [ 6 ] In 2008 , he finished third for both the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year . Striving to compete for trophies, Torres left Liverpool in January 2011 to join Chelsea for a Premier League record transfer fee of £50 million , which made him the most expensive Spanish player in history. At Chelsea, he won the FA Cup , the UEFA Champions League , and the UEFA Europa League . Torres went on to have a brief stint at AC Milan before returning to Atlético Madrid, where he won the 2017-18 UEFA Europa League . He signed for Japanese club Sagan Tosu in July 2018, before retiring from professional football after the 2019 season . In 2003, Torres made his debut for Spain in a friendly against Portugal . He was capped 110 times and is his country's third-highest top goalscorer with 38 goals. With Spain, he participated in six major tournaments: UEFA Euro 2004 , 2006 FIFA World Cup , Euro 2008 , 2010 World Cup , Euro 2012 , and 2014 World Cup . Spain won the 2008, 2010, and 2012 tournaments and Torres scored in the finals of both Euro 2008 and Euro 2012 . He won the Golden Boot for scoring the most goals in the 2012 tournament. Early career Born in Fuenlabrada , Community of Madrid , [ 7 ] Torres loved football as a child and joined his first youth team, Parque 84, at age five. [ 8 ] His grandfather was an Atlético Madrid fan. [ 8 ] Torres began playing football as a goalkeeper . [ 9 ] At age seven, he began playing as a striker for Mario’s Holanda, the neighbourhood’s' indoor football ' club [ 10 ] , [ 8 ] using the characters from the anime Captain Tsubasa as inspiration. [ 11 ] At age 10, he joined Rayo 13 and scored 55 goals in his first season. He later joined Atlético’s youth system at age 11 in 1995. [ 12 ] Club career Atlético Madrid Torres entering the pitch on his debut for Atlético Madrid on 27 May 2001 After progressing through the ranks, Torres won his first important youth title in 1998. [ 12 ] Atlético sent an under-15 team to compete in the Nike Cup, in Spain and Europe, to play against youth teams from other clubs; Atlético won the tournament. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] He was later voted the best player in Europe for the age group. [ 13 ] In 1999, at the age of 15, Torres signed his first professional contract with Atlético. [ 12 ] He spent his first year playing in the youth team and participated in the Honor Division when he was 16. [ 14 ] The 2000–01 season had started poorly, as Torres suffered from a cracked shinbone which kept him out of play until December. [ 14 ] Torres trained with the first team to get prepared for pre-season, but eventually made his debut on 27 May 2001, at the Vicente Calderón Stadium , against Leganés . [ 14 ] One week later, he scored his first goal for the club, against Albacete , and the season finished with Atlético narrowly missing out on promotion to La Liga . [ 14 ] Atlético were promoted to La Liga at the end of the 2001–02 season , although Torres did not perform well in the season, as he netted only 6 times in 36 appearances in the Segunda División . [ 15 ] Torres's first season in La Liga, 2002–03 , was better, however, as he scored 13 goals in 29 appearances, with Atlético finishing in 11th place. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In July 2003, soon after his takeover of the club, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich had a £ 28 million bid for Torres rejected by Atlético's board of directors. [ 16 ] In the 2003–04 season , his second in La Liga, Torres made further strides, scoring 19 league goals in 35 appearances, [ 15 ] meaning he finished as the joint third-highest scorer in the league. [ 17 ] At age 19, Torres was named Atlético's captain . [ 13 ] Atlético narrowly missed out on qualification for the UEFA Cup , but by finishing in seventh place in the 2003–04 season, they qualified for the 2004 UEFA Intertoto Cup , giving Torres a first taste of a competition at the European level. [ 18 ] He scored two goals in the two fourth round matches against OFK Beograd , with one coming in each leg. [ 18 ] Atlético reached the final, but lost 3–1 on a penalty shoot-out to Villarreal following a 2–2 draw on aggregate. [ 18 ] FA Premier League champions Chelsea were believed to be interested in signing Torres during the summer of 2005, but Atlético club president Enrique Cerezo said that they had "no chance" of signing him. [ 19 ] Cerezo later said in January 2006 that the club was willing to listen to offers for Torres, and Torres claimed Newcastle United of the FA Premier League had made a bid to sign him in March. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Torres playing for Atlético Madrid in 2006 Torres stated after the 2006 FIFA World Cup that he had turned down an offer to join Chelsea at the end of the 2005–06 season . [ 22 ] He scored 14 league goals in the 2006–07 season . [ 15 ] The English media reported that he was the main transfer target of FA Premier League club Liverpool , [ 23 ] but Cerezo stated, "We've received no offer from Liverpool or any other club or player." [ 24 ] Days later, however, new reports suggested Atlético had agreed a deal with Liverpool for Torres; the fee was rumoured to be £25 million with Luis García moving to Atlético in a separate transfer deal. [ 25 ] On 30 June, Atlético announced a deal to sign Diego Forlán from Villarreal, in what was seen as a move to replace Torres before his departure became official. [ 26 ] On 2 July, it was reported that Torres had cut short a vacation to fly back to Madrid to finalise the move to Liverpool. [ 27 ] The following day, Torres passed a medical at Liverpool's Melwood training ground. [ 28 ] He held a press conference in Madrid on 4 July to bid farewell to the Atlético fans, before completing his move to Liverpool on a six-year contract. [ 28 ] The transfer fee was the highest in Liverpool's history. [ 26 ] In March 2008, manager Rafael Benítez stated in an interview with The Times that Torres was acquired for around £20 million, although this figure takes into account García's move to Atlético. [ 29 ] Liverpool 2007–08 season Torres made his competitive debut for Liverpool against Aston Villa in a 2–1 win on 11 August 2007. [ 30 ] He made his first appearance in the UEFA Champions League four days past his first performance in a 1–0 victory over Toulouse , after coming on as a 79th minute substitute . [ 31 ] His first Premier League goal came on his Anfield debut on 19 August 2007, in the 16th minute in a 1–1 draw against Chelsea. [ 32 ] His first hat-trick came in a 4–2 victory over Reading in the League Cup on 25 September 2007, with all of his goals coming in the second half. [ 33 ] His first goals in the Champions League came on his third appearance in the competition as Liverpool beat Porto 4–1 on 28 November 2007, as he scored twice. [ 34 ] Torres was named the Premier League Player of the Month for February 2008, [ 35 ] during which he scored four goals in four appearances, including a hat-trick against Middlesbrough on 23 February 2008. [ 36 ] This hat-trick and another in a 4–0 victory over West Ham United on 5 March 2008 meant he became the first Liverpool player since Jack Balmer in November 1946 to score a hat-trick in successive home matches. [ 37 ] Later in March, after he scored a 47th-minute header against Reading at Anfield, he became the first Liverpool player since Robbie Fowler in the 1995–96 season to score 20 league goals in a season. [ 38 ] In April, he scored another Champions League goal, this time against Arsenal in the quarter-final second leg, as Liverpool advanced to the semi-final. [ 39 ] This goal took him onto 29 goals for the 2007–08 season in all competitions, [ 36 ] eclipsing Michael Owen 's personal record for goals in a season. [ 40 ] On 11 April 2008, it was announced Torres had made a six-man shortlist for the PFA Players' Player of the Year award, [ 41 ] which was eventually won by Cristiano Ronaldo of Manchester United . [ 42 ] The Spanish international was also nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year Award, which was won by Cesc Fàbregas of Arsenal and was named in the PFA Team of the Year . [ 42 ] In May, he finished second to Ronaldo for the FWA Footballer of the Year award. [ 43 ] On 4 May 2008, Torres scored a 57th-minute winner against Manchester City , which equalled the consecutive Anfield league goal record of eight games set by Roger Hunt . [ 36 ] [ 44 ] After scoring his 24th league goal in the final game of the season, a 2–0 win against Tottenham Hotspur , he set a new record for the most prolific foreign goal scorer in a debut season in England, eclipsing Ruud van Nistelrooy 's 23 goals. [ 36 ] [ 45 ] He ended the season in joint second place with Emmanuel Adebayor in the race for the Premier League golden boot. [ 46 ] Torres was subject to media speculation that Chelsea were willing to pay £50 million to sign him, but Torres responded by saying it would be "many years" before he left Liverpool. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Liverpool co-owner Tom Hicks also negated the idea of a transfer, saying he would not allow Torres to leave the club at any price. [ 49 ] 2008–09 season Torres playing for Liverpool in 2008 Torres made a scoring start to the 2008–09 Premier League season with a 25-yard shot into the bottom right-hand corner away at Sunderland , which was the only goal in a 1–0 win on 16 August 2008. [ 50 ] He suffered a hamstring tear in a 0–0 draw against Aston Villa, which would keep him out for two to three weeks. [ 51 ] Torres made his return in a 2–1 victory against Marseille in the Champions League and went on to score two goals in the Merseyside derby against Everton on 27 September 2008 to give Liverpool a 2–0 win. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] He followed this up with another two goals the following weekend against Manchester City in a 3–2 win away at the City of Manchester Stadium as Liverpool came back from a two-goal deficit. [ 54 ] The first of these was the thousandth Liverpool goal to be scored in the Premier League. [ 55 ] Torres picked up a hamstring injury during a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier , meaning he was likely to miss three games for Liverpool. [ 56 ] On 22 October 2008, Liverpool played Torres's former club Atlético in the Champions League at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, but his injury meant he missed out on the game. [ 57 ] Atlético president Enrique Cerezo had given him a VIP invitation to watch the game, but he declined this to continue his rehabilitation from injury in Merseyside. [ 58 ] He was named in the FIFPro World XI team for the 2007–08 season on 27 October 2008. [ 59 ] Torres made his return for Liverpool on 8 November 2008 after coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute in a 3–0 victory against West Bromwich Albion . [ 60 ] He said he would be interested in returning to former club Atlético eventually, saying, "I don't know if I will retire there, but I would like to go back and finish some things that are left to do." [ 61 ] He was ruled out of action for two to three weeks following Liverpool's 1–0 victory over Marseille in the Champions League in November, where he picked up a hamstring strain, [ 62 ] which was later extended to at least four weeks by specialists. [ 63 ] He was named on the shortlist for the FIFA World Player of the Year award in December, [ 64 ] and eventually came in third place behind Ronaldo and Lionel Messi . [ 65 ] Torres returned to action on 3 January 2009 as a substitute with a goal in the 2–0 win over Preston North End , his first in the FA Cup . [ 66 ] He scored two late goals for Liverpool to secure a 2–0 victory over Chelsea on 1 February 2009. [ 67 ] Despite having spent a year and a half at the club, Torres was chosen as number 50 in The Times' s list of "The 50 greatest Liverpool players", reinforcing the impact he had made at Liverpool in such a short period of time. [ 68 ] Torres faced his old rivals Real Madrid on 10 March 2009 in the Champions League last 16 and due to an ankle injury, he had a painkilling injection before the game to enable him to play. [ 69 ] He scored the first goal of the game, which ended as a 4–0 victory, meaning Liverpool progressed to the quarter-finals 5–0 on aggregate. [ 70 ] Four days later, he lined up against Manchester United at Old Trafford and he scored the equaliser in a game that finished as a 4–1 victory. [ 71 ] His goal celebration at Old Trafford endeared him to Liverpool fans when he held out his hand to United fans – making the "five times" gesture – signifying Liverpool's five Champions League titles (to United's three). [ 72 ] He was named in the PFA Team of the Year for the second season running in April 2009. [ 73 ] Torres scored his 50th goal for Liverpool on 24 May 2009 against Tottenham on the final day of the 2008–09 season , his 84th appearance. [ 74 ] 2009–10 season Torres (third from right) lining up for Liverpool in 2010 Following the end of the season, Torres agreed a new contract with Liverpool, [ 75 ] which he signed on 14 August. [ 76 ] By signing, Torres had the option of a one-year extension after the contract's expiration in 2013. [ 77 ] Torres scored two goals in a 3–2 win over West Ham United on 19 September 2009, a result that took Liverpool to third in the Premier League. [ 78 ] One week later, he scored his first hat-trick of the 2009–10 Premier League season in a 6–1 victory over Hull City at Anfield. [ 79 ] He was named Premier League Player of the Month for September, after scoring five goals during the month and becoming the Premier League's top goalscorer . [ 80 ] On 25 October 2009, he scored the first goal in a 2–0 victory for Liverpool over Manchester United, [ 81 ] after which Rafael Benítez praised Torres's performance, saying, "We were waiting for that final pass. When it came we knew he would score." [ 82 ] Torres was named in the FIFPro World XI for the second successive season in December 2009. [ 83 ] His stoppage-time winning goal against Aston Villa on 29 December 2009 made him the fastest Liverpool player ever to score 50 league goals. [ 84 ] He was substituted on 65 minutes in a 1–1 draw with Birmingham City on 4 April 2010, which Benítez justified by saying Torres was "exhausted". [ 85 ] Torres made his last appearance of the season scoring twice in a 4–1 victory over Benfica in the Europa League on 8 April 2010, [ 86 ] and it was announced on 18 April that he would miss the rest of the season to undergo knee surgery. [ 87 ] This meant that Torres finished the season with 22 goals in 32 games in all competitions, finishing as Liverpool's top scorer for the second time. [ 86 ] 2010–11 season Torres playing for Liverpool in 2010 Following Roy Hodgson 's appointment as Liverpool manager, Hodgson stated that Torres would not be sold by the club, saying, "He is not for sale and we don't welcome any offers for him. We want to keep him." [ 88 ] Hodgson dismissed reports Torres was set to leave Liverpool by saying, "He has told us that he is looking forward to Monday, to getting back to work and looking forward to playing for Liverpool next season. That is what I know so other reports, I would suggest, are erroneous." [ 89 ] Torres stated his commitment to Liverpool on 3 August: "My commitment and loyalty to the club and to the fans is the same as it was on my first day when I signed." [ 90 ] Torres made his first appearance of the 2010–11 season in the opening match, a 1–1 draw with Arsenal on 14 August 2010, entering the game as a substitute in the 74th minute. [ 91 ] He scored his first goal of the season with the winner in a 1–0 victory over West Brom on 29 August 2010, [ 92 ] his 50th goal at Anfield in all competitions. [ 93 ] Torres scored the winning goal in a 2–1 victory at home to Blackburn Rovers on 24 October 2010, his first goal since August. [ 94 ] He scored his final goals for Liverpool in a 3–0 win away at Wolverhampton Wanderers on 22 January 2011. [ 95 ] Chelsea On 27 January 2011 , Torres was the subject of a £40 million bid from Carlo Ancelotti 's Chelsea, which was rejected by Liverpool. [ 96 ] He handed in an official transfer request to Liverpool the next day, which was rejected. [ 97 ] Torres completed his move to Chelsea on a five-and-a-half-year contract on 31 January 2011 for an undisclosed fee reported to be £50 million, which set a new record for a British transfer and made him the sixth most expensive footballer in history. [ 98 ] He made his Chelsea debut on 6 February 2011 in a 1–0 home defeat to former club Liverpool. [ 99 ] On 23 April 2011, Torres scored his first goal for Chelsea against West Ham United in a 3–0 victory, which ended a run of 903 minutes of football without a goal. [ 100 ] This was his only goal for Chelsea in the 2010–11 season, having made 18 appearances for his new club. [ 101 ] 2011–12 season Torres playing for Chelsea in 2011 Torres got the 2011–12 season underway in Chelsea's 0–0 draw away against Stoke City on 14 August 2011, in which his "link-up play was sharp, plus he was willing to make intelligent runs into space to receive the ball". [ 102 ] He scored his second goal at Chelsea, and his first of the season, on 18 September 2011, in a 3–1 away defeat to Manchester United. However, that was overshadowed by his miss at an open goal. [ 103 ] He scored his second goal of the season at home to Swansea City in a 4–1 victory. [ 104 ] Ten minutes after his goal, however, a two-footed challenge on Mark Gower resulted in his first red card in English football and a three-match domestic suspension. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] On 19 October 2011, Torres scored two goals in a 5–0 victory against Genk in the Champions League, his first in Europe since the quarter-final of the 2008–09 Champions League with his old club Liverpool, against Chelsea. [ 107 ] His next Chelsea goals came after scoring twice and also assisting two others against Championship team Leicester City in an FA Cup quarter-final on 18 March 2012, ending a goal drought that stretched 24 games. [ 108 ] On 31 March 2012, Torres scored his first Premier League goal since 24 September 2011, against Aston Villa in a 4–2 away win. [ 109 ] Torres came on as a substitute for Didier Drogba on 24 April 2012 to score a last-minute goal against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final, which gave Chelsea a 2–2 draw, and cemented Barcelona's elimination from the tournament. Chelsea were already winning on the away goals rule, but finally won on aggregate score (3–2). [ 110 ] He scored the first hat-trick of his Chelsea career in a 6–1 win against Queens Park Rangers at Stamford Bridge on 29 April 2012. [ 111 ] Torres came on in the second half of the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final on 19 May 2012, directly after Bayern Munich 's opening goal, and following a 1–1 draw after extra time Chelsea won the penalty shoot-out 4–3. [ 112 ] His first full season at Chelsea finished with 11 goals in 49 appearances. [ 109 ] 2012–13 season Torres playing for Chelsea in the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup Final Torres started the 2012–13 season in the 2012 FA Community Shield against Manchester City at Villa Park , where he scored the opening goal, as Chelsea lost 3–2. [ 113 ] On 19 August 2012, he appeared in Chelsea's first league match in a 2–0 away win against Wigan Athletic . [ 114 ] Torres scored his first goal of the season in Chelsea's next match on 22 August 2012, a 4–2 home win against Reading, scoring the third goal to give his side the lead. [ 115 ] He also scored against Newcastle United, Arsenal and Norwich City as Chelsea topped the table in the early weeks of the season . [ 116 ] [ 117 ] Torres was sent off for receiving two yellow cards against Manchester United on 28 October 2012, the second for diving , leaving Chelsea with nine men after teammate Branislav Ivanović was also sent off; the team went on to lose 3–2. [ 118 ] Torres scored his first goal in the Champions League for the season after deflecting Shakhtar Donetsk goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov 's clearance into goal, as Chelsea needed a 94th-minute winner from Victor Moses to secure a 3–2 victory on 7 November 2012. [ 119 ] On 21 November 2012, Roberto Di Matteo was replaced as Chelsea manager by Rafael Benítez, who had previously coached Torres at Liverpool. [ 120 ] It was reported that one reason for Benítez's appointment was to help Torres return to his best form. [ 121 ] Torres ended a goal drought that stretched over 11 hours of game time with two goals in Chelsea's 6–1 defeat of Nordsjælland in the Champions League on 5 December 2012. [ 122 ] Three days later, he scored another two goals, ending a run of eight Premier League games without a goal, as Chelsea defeated Sunderland 3–1. [ 123 ] He then scored in Chelsea's 2012 FIFA Club World Cup semi-final 3–1 win against Monterrey of the Mexican Liga MX on 13 December 2012, before playing in the 1–0 defeat to Brazilian Série A side Corinthians in the final three days later. [ 116 ] On 14 March 2013, Torres scored the third goal as Chelsea defeated Steaua București 3–1 to advance 3–2 on aggregate to the quarter-final of the Europa League . [ 116 ] With this goal, Torres became the first player to score in seven different competitions in one season. [ 124 ] He scored twice against Rubin Kazan in the 3–1 win in the first leg of the Europa League quarter-final on 4 April 2013, before scoring again in the second leg 3–2 defeat, with Chelsea progressing to the semi-final 5–4 on aggregate. [ 116 ] Torres scored the opening goal in Chelsea's 2–1 triumph over Benfica in the 2013 UEFA Europa League Final on 15 May 2013.
