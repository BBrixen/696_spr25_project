I was so-so about it in the beginning because when I was younger I didn't want to practice at all. I just wanted to play with my friends. When I turned eight, that was when I played 'Little Mo' and after that I decided to do that for the rest of my life." [ 12 ] [ 14 ] Gauff's parents gave up their careers to focus on training their daughter. Her father later became her primary coach, while her mother oversaw her homeschooling .

When she looks at you and tells you she will be number one, you can only believe it."

After winning the Cincinnati Open in August 2023, she said: "… I'd like to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I spent a lot of nights alone, crying trying to figure it out. I still have a lot to figure out, but I thank Him for covering me." After winning her first Grand Slam title in September 2023, she said: "… I don't pray for results, I just ask that I get the strength to give it my all and whatever happens happens. I'm so blessed in this life." [ 139 ] Gauff's tennis idols are Serena and Venus Williams. "Serena Williams has always been my idol...and Venus," she has said.
