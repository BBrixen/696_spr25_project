It will be the first time in NFL history that a team plays the Super Bowl in its home stadium. With game day approaching, we've put together a guide below to help. Whether you a Bucs fan or a Chiefs fan - or you're just watching for the commercials and don't care who wins - we hope it proves helpful. You can also visit our Super Bowl section for feature stories, safety precations and more details we've reported the last few days. HOW TO WATCH/LISTEN The game will air on CBS, with kickoff just after 6 p.m on February 7. You can listen locally on 97.9 FM as well as Westwood One affiliates. Make sure to join us after the game for highlights, fan reaction and more from our Spectrum Bay News 9 and Spectrum Sport's 360 teams. If you're away from your TV, you can catch all the recap action on the Spectrum News app. CAN I STILL GET A TICKET? If you have money to spare ... and lots of it. About 22,000 fans will be allowed to attend under COVID-19 regulations. As we've reported, the average price of a ticket was about $28,000. There is quite a bit you can purchase for that. I'M GOING TO RAYJAY. WHAT CAN I BRING? What we can tell you (from the Raymond James Stadium website ) is this: A no bag policy is in effect for all events at Raymond James Stadium. Guests are only permitted to bring in one clutch purse no larger than 4.5” by 6.5”. Please return all other bags to your vehicles or take advantage of the storage lockers available for rent on Tom McEwen Blvd, south of Gate C. Face coverings will be mandatory for anyone, 5 years of age or older and must be worn at all times (other than while actively eating or drinking). All face coverings must cover nose and mouth. Tailgating and recreational activities (throwing footballs, etc.) are not allowed. Guests or pods of guests must maintain six foot distancing to the extent that physical distancing is possible. All retail & food/beverage locations will be cashless. Reverse ATMs will be available at select locations to convert cash to a universal use visa value card. WHAT KIND OF TRAFFIC ISSUES SHOULD I EXPECT? Whether or not you're going to the game, Tampa residents and those passing through the city need to know about some road closures: From the City of Tampa: N Boulevard between W Main Street and W Cypress Street from 6:00 a.m., Saturday, January 23 to midnight, Thursday, February 11. W Gasparilla Plaza between W Cass Street and N Ashley Drive from 6:00 a.m., Saturday, January 23 to midnight, Thursday, February 11.

Please use caution while driving in the area. Modifications may be necessary during the closure. ARE MASKS JUST FOR THE GAME? Tampa Mayor Jane Castor issued an executive order , requiring masks to be worn outdoors during Super Bowl week within specific locations in the city. The mask mandate will apply to "event zones." Those include: Areas of downtown Tampa The Area surrounding Raymond James Stadium The order also covers "entertainment districts," which include: Ybor City Historic District South Howard Commercial Overlay District Central Business District Channel District You can read more about the mask order here. WHO IS PERFORMING FOR THE HALFTIME SHOW? Pepsi, the NFL and Roc Nation announced The Weeknd will perform during the Pepsi Super Bowl LV Halftime Show. The Weeknd has amassed a global fanbase, become a multi-award winning artist, and recently, was named by Time Magazine as one of the most influential people of 2020. The Weeknd is known for his genre-bending music and redefining storytelling, both sonically and visually. (Source: NFL Website) IS THIS THE FIRST TIME TAMPA HAS HOSTED THE SUPER BOWL? No. Tampa has hosted it four times: Super Bowl XVIII (Raiders beat Redskins), Super Bowl XXV (Giants beat Bills) Super Bowl XXXV (Ravens beat Giants), Super Bowl XLIII (Steelers beat Cardinals). The first two of those were at the former Tampa Stadium - affectionately referred to as the "Big Sombrero." The third and fourth Super Bowl games were at RayJay. I'M NOT GOING TO THE GAME. BUT I STILL WANT TO CHECK OUT EVENTS The Tampa Riverwalk and Julian B. Lane Riverfront Park have transformed to host events. But – and this is important – if you haven't already secured a reservation for the Super Bowl Experience, it's too late. Check out photos and more details here.
