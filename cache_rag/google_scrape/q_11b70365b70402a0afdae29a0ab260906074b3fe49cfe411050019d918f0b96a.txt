Click here to add more. üìù Database Entry [ ] Yuri Bychkov YURI BYCHKOV Hansen's lieutenant and close comrade from the days of "Midnight Storm" - the operation to occupy Pacifica. Normally a loyal soldier, his reputation has recently taken a hit - he messed up big-time, started making deals behind Kurt's back... Subtlety is not his strong suit - he'd rather shoot all his problems than fix them.  After years of serving under Hansen, he's getting increasingly annoyed with being treated as an inferior. Either he proves himself through loyalty and resourcefulness... or through shrewdness and wile. As a gambling man, he couldn't choose anything but the latter.
