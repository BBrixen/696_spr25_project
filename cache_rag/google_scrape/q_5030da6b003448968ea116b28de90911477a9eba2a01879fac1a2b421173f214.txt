The events feature activities and decorations based on Animal Crossing: New Horizons , specifically its museum and the in-game International Museum Day event. The event was initially held at the Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise in Japan from July 12 to August 31, 2021, and it has since been brought to several more aquariums across the country. The event made its debut in the United States at the Seattle Aquarium from October 7, 2023 to March 31, 2024. These events all had the name Animal Crossing: New Horizons × <Aquarium Name> , before they expanded to a national level in the United States in June 2024 and adopted the general " Animal Crossing: New Horizons Aquarium Tour" name.
