Early life [ edit ] Moore, the eldest of four children, was born in Newry , County Down , Northern Ireland. [ 2 ] At an early age, his family moved to Kilkenny in the Republic of Ireland where his father worked as an engineer. During his early to mid-teens, Moore joined the Young Irish Film Makers in Kilkenny, where he grew his knowledge and passion for film and animation. After leaving St Kieran's College secondary school, he studied classical animation at Ballyfermot College of Further Education in Dublin. Career [ edit ] During his final year at Ballyfermot in 1999, Moore co-founded the Cartoon Saloon animation studio with Paul Young and Nora Twomey . Initially they set up studio alongside Moore's alma mater Young Irish Film Makers, but the studio soon outgrew the premises. The studio created the television series Skunk Fu! . Moore's first animated feature film, which he co-directed with Nora Twomey , is The Secret of Kells (2009), written by Fabrice Ziolkowski from a story by Moore and Aidan Harte. It is a co-production by the Cartoon Saloon, Les Armateurs, Vivi Film and France 2 Cinéma.

It premiered on 8 February 2009, at the Berlin International Film Festival . It went into wide release in Belgium and France on 11 February, and in the Republic of Ireland on 3 March.

Also in 2014, Moore co-directed a segment of the Salma Hayek produced film The Prophet with Ross Stewart, adapted from Kahlil Gibran 's book of prose poetry essays of the same name . The production consisted of different directors for each of the film's collective essays, with animation director , Roger Allers supervising and credited as screenwriter .  Both of Moore's 2014 films received their world premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival . [ 6 ] Moore's third directorial feature film (co-directed with Ross Stewart), Wolfwalkers , was released in 2020 on Apple TV+ . [ 7 ] The film is the final installment in Moore's "Irish Folklore trilogy", comprising Wolfwalkers , Song of the Sea , and The Secret of Kells . [ 8 ] Comics [ edit ] Moore has drawn two Irish language graphic novels, An Sclábhaí ("the slave", 2001) and An Teachtaire ("the messenger", 2003), telling the story of St. Patrick . Both were written by Colmán Ó Raghallaigh and published in Ireland by Cló Mhaigh Eo.
