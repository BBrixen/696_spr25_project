The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced the award nominations in Los Angeles, early Tuesday morning. Eight other films were nominated for best picture including small-budget projects Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, and Lady Bird . Three Billboards received a total of nine nominations. The big-budget World War II movie Dunkirk came next with seven nominations, including best picture. The other candidates for the top academy award are Get Out, The Post, Darkest Hour, Call Me By Your Name and Phantom Thread . Greta Gerwig, who directed Lady Bird, became the fifth woman nominated for best director. Get Out director Jordan Peele was the fifth African-American director so honored. Rachel Morrison, director of photography for the movie Mudbound , made history as the first woman ever nominated for an Oscar in cinematography . Meryl Streep received her 21st Oscar nomination for her work in The Post. She plays former Washington Post newspaper publisher Katharine Graham. Streep has won three Oscars, one fewer than Katherine Hepburn. Christopher Plummer received a best supporting actor nomination for his part in All the Money in the World. Plummer replaced Kevin Spacey who was removed from the movie after accusations of sexual wrongdoing. Plummer was added to the film in reshoots little more than a month before the film’s release. Filmmaker Rachel Morrison Winners will be named at the Academy Awards ceremony March 4 in Hollywood, California. More than 30 million people are expected to watch the live television broadcast of the event. Last year, the broadcast ended with an envelope mix-up that led to La La Land being wrongly announced as the best picture winner. Officials quickly corrected the mistake and presented the award to makers of the film Moonlight. This year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has barred those who handle the envelopes from using cellphones or social media during the show. I’m Jonathan Evans.
