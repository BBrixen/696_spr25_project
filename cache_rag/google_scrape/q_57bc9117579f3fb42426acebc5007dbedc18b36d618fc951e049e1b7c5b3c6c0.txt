Every year, one player rises above the competition to claim this honor, etching their name into the sport's storied history. From legends like Barry Sanders and Bo Jackson to recent stars like DeVonta Smith and Caleb Williams, the Heisman winners list reads like a who's who of college football greatness. Here’s a complete look at every player who's claimed the Heisman Trophy—each bringing their own flair and impact to the game. The Legacy of the Heisman Trophy Since 1935, the Heisman Trophy has been presented to the most outstanding FBS player in college football. It is awarded by the Heisman Trust at an annual ceremony attended by the finalists. New York’s Downtown Athletic Club originally created the DAC Trophy to recognize the best collegiate player east of the Mississippi River, but one year later everything changed. John Heisman, the group’s athletic director, passed away in 1936 and they renamed the trophy in his honor while also making the award a national one. Heisman coached baseball, basketball and football during his 35-year career, winning the 1917 football championship with Georgia Tech.

The Buckeyes’ ball carrier won in 1974 and 1975 after rushing for 2,977 yards and 16 touchdowns over the two seasons. Many have disputed his second trophy, arguing that Cal running back Chuck Muncie should have won. Muncie did finish with 10 more rushing yards and nine more touchdowns than Griffin, but Griffin led the Buckeyes to an undefeated regular season and a Rose Bowl appearance. Which Schools Have Produced the Most Heisman Trophy Winners? USC has the most Heisman Trophy winners with eight, followed by Notre Dame, Ohio State and Oklahoma with seven each. Alabama is in a distant fifth place with four. USC Trojans (8): Caleb Williams (2022), Reggie Bush (2005), Matt Leinart (2004), Carson Palmer (2002), Marcus Allen (1981), Charles White (1979), O.J. Simpson (1968), Mike Garrett (1965) Notre Dame Fighting Irish (7): Tim Brown (1987), John Huarte (1964), Paul Hornung (1956), John Lattner (1953), Leon Hart (1949), John Lujack (1947), Angelo Bertelli (1943) Ohio State Buckeyes (7): Troy Smith (2006), Eddie George (1995), Archie Griffin (1975), Archie Griffin (1974), Howard Cassady (1955), Vic Janowicz (1950), Les Horvath (1944) Oklahoma Sooners (7): Kyler Murray (2018), Baker Mayfield (2017), Sam Bradford (2008), Jason White (2003), Billy Sims (1978), Steve Owens (1969), Billy Vessels (1952) Alabama Crimson Tide (4): Bryce Young (2021), DeVonta Smith (2020), Derrick Henry (2015), Mark Ingram (2009). The Positions Most Often Represented by Heisman Winners Over the award’s history there have been 38 quarterbacks to win (the most recent being LSU’s Jayden Daniels in 2023). There have been 44 running backs/half backs/fullbacks to win (the most recent was Alabama’s Derrick Henry in 2015). Just four wide receivers have won the Heisman (Alabama’s DeVonta Smith won in 2020, breaking a near 30-year drought for the position). There have only been two tight ends to win the award, both of whom won before 1950. Just one defensive player, Michigan’s Charles Woodson, has won the Heisman (1997). The Heisman is typically viewed as a quarterback award nowadays, with 20 signal callers having won since 2000. Considering the quarterback is the lone player to touch the football on every play, there’s certainly some justification for the position dominating the award in recent years. However, there have been plenty of years where fans and pundits alike have rolled their eyes at the committee’s selection. Sometimes the biggest snubs have been skill-position players, while other years have had the nation split on which quarterback should have won. Notable Heisman Trophy Snubs and Controversies Adrian Peterson, Oklahoma (2004): The Heisman went to USC quarterback Matt Leinart in 2004, but there’s a very serious case to be made for Peterson. Leinart led the Trojans to an undefeated season and threw for 3,322 yards and 33 touchdowns. However, Peterson finished third in the nation with 1,925 yards and scored 15 touchdowns. He is considered the best freshman in college football history, but that’s also what held him back. A true freshman has never won the Heisman Trophy, and only two players have won it as a redshirt freshman. It seems like if Peterson had been a year older, he would’ve won. But when comparing the two player’s stats this probably should have been Peterson’s year. Marshall Faulk, San Diego State (1992): Miami quarterback Gino Torretta won the Heisman in 1992, but with the passage of time most agree that he probably shouldn’t have. Torretta had won 23-straight games for Miami before losing to Alabama in the Sugar Bowl, and in 1992 he threw for 3,060 yards and 19 touchdowns. Miami had a much tougher schedule than San Diego State–and the Hurricanes dominated the Aztecs in a head-to-head matchup. However, Faulk had a far superior season leading the nation with 1,630 yards on 265 carries with 15 touchdowns. Larry Fitzgerald, Pittsburgh (2003): Oklahoma quarterback Jason White overcame two knee surgeries to lead the Sooners to a national championship appearance, throwing for 40 touchdowns and just six interceptions in the regular season. But Fitzgerald led the nation in receiving touchdowns with 22 and receiving yards with 1,672. He only had one game with fewer than 75 receiving yards. Ndamukong Suh, Nebraska (2009): Mark Ingram won the 2009 Heisman Trophy, finishing 10th in rushing yards and 11th in rushing touchdowns. He was a very good player on an Alabama team that built around its stifling defense. He was a fine player. But he shouldn’t have won the Heisman. Because Suh put together perhaps the most dominant season by a defensive lineman ever. Suh finished with 12 sacks, 24 tackles for a loss, 10 pass breakups, 26 quarterback hurries, one interception and three blocked kicks. He was so good that Nebraska practically never blitzed, because Suh would beat his blockers with such ease. Suh finished fourth in Heisman voting, which many consider a travesty. Heisman Trophy Winner Fun Facts The oldest player to win the Heisman Trophy is Florida State’s Chris Weinke. He was 28 years old. Six programs have won back-to-back Heismans: Alabama, Oklahoma, USC, Ohio State, Army and Yale. There are 10 players who won the Heisman and then went on to win the Super Bowl: Paul Hornung, Roger Staubach, Mike Garrett, Jim Plunkett, Tony Dorsett, Marcus Allen, George Rogers, Desmond Howard, Charles Woodson and Reggie Bush. There are also 10 Heisman winners in the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Charles Woodson, Tim Brown, Barry Sanders, Marcus Allen, Tony Dorsett, Earl Campbell, Paul Hornung, Doak Walker, Roger Staubach and O.J. Simpson. The Heisman Trophy stands 13.5 inches tall and weighs 45 pounds Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield is the only player to start his career as a walk-on and finish it with a Heisman.
