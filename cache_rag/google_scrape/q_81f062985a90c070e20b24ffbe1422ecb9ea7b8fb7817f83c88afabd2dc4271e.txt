The IOC  decision, made in Durbin, South Africa, awarded South Korea the Winter Games  over competitive bids from Munich, Germany, and Annecy, France. Pyeongchang is  located on the Nweh-Un River in the Taebaek Mountains region of Gangwon  province, approximately 180 kilometers southeast of Seoul. The city has a  population of 45,482 (as of the 2005 census). Q1: Was this South Korea’s  first time bidding for the Winter Olympics? A1: No. This is the third time that  Pyeongchang has bid for the Winter Games. It lost narrowly in competitions for  both the 2014 games (awarded to Sochi, Russia) and the 2010 games (awarded to  Vancouver, Canada). In both previous bids, South Korea was considered one of  the leading candidates after initial rounds of technical evaluations of  presentations but lost out in subsequent rounds. Q2: Why did South Korea  win this time? A2: It is difficult to understand the  machinations of the IOC. It was clear from the 2010 and 2014 competitions that  Korea had a strong technical bid. The IOC prizes things such as the quality of  the sports venues and financial statements, in which South Korea always did  well. But in this case, it was probably the combination of the country’s strong  performance in the Vancouver Games—including the gold medal performances of  athletes like Kim Yuna in figure skating and Mo Tae-Bum and Lee Sang-Hwa Lee in  speed skating—and a more savvy, pitch-perfect presentation that focused on the  potential for Korea to act as a gateway for the IOC to bring winter sports to  all of Asia. Q3: How significant is Pyeongchang’s  win in the wider Olympic movement? A3: Quite significant. Pyeongchang is the  first Asian city in two decades to host the games, and South Korea is only the  second Asian country in modern Olympic history to host the winter event. The  other two times were in Japan: Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998. The Winter  Games have generally been the purview of the Europeans and to some extent the  Americans. The other two bids from Munich and Annecy represented traditional  powerhouses of winter sports. Pyeongchang’s win shows that the IOC is seeking  to expand the scope and popularity of winter sports to Asia and, in this  regard, follows a trend that has already been present in the Summer Olympics  where the bid cities and host sites are increasingly in Asia—most recently  evident in the 2008 Games in Beijing, but before that Seoul in 1988 and Tokyo  in 1964. This win will undeniably motivate China to prepare a bid for a future  Winter Games just as Seoul’s 1988 Summer Games did for Beijing to bid in 1992  for the 2000 games (which they lost to Sydney). Q4: What impact will this  have on North-South relations? A4: As I wrote in Beyond the Final Score: The Politics of Sport in Asia (Columbia  University Press, 2009), North Korea will likely have something negative to say  about South Korea’s win or will try to keep the news from its people. Pyongyang  has always tried to seek some formula for cohosting some of the Olympic events  even though it was never part of any IOC bid by the south. What was interesting  about South Korea’s presentation to the IOC this time was its focus on how  Pyeongchang offered the Winter Olympics a “New Horizon” in Asia for winter  sports. This contrasted with the South Korean bid under the previous government  for the 2014 Games, which focused on how the Olympics could help promote unity  and reconciliation between the two Koreas (Pyeongchang is located in the only  province on the Korean peninsula that remains divided from the Korean War). In  the 2014 bid, the South Koreans even sought a letter of support from the North  Korean delegation. I believe this had the unintended consequence of backfiring  because it tried to play too much politics with sport, which the IOC rejected. Victor D.
