Fantasy Watch Network Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement TRENDING NFL Power Rankings Warriors win intense Game 4 Cavs sweep Heat Dame's injury casts wide ripple Full NFL Draft grades Tua Tagovailoa wins Maxwell Award while Kyler Murray takes Davey O'Brien Award Nick Bromberg Senior writer December 7, 2018 at 2:04 AM UTC We have the ingredients for a very close Heisman vote on Saturday. Alabama’s Tua Tagovailoa won the Maxwell Award on Thursday night. It goes to the player of the year. He beat out Oklahoma’s Kyler Murray and West Virginia’s Will Grier for the award. Tagovailoa also won the Walter Camp Award, another award that goes to the best player in the country. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement While Tagovailoa was voted the best player, he didn’t win best quarterback. Murray took home the Davey O’Brien Award, which goes to the best quarterback. He beat out Tagovailoa and Washington State’s Gardner Minshew. Oklahoma’s Baker Mayfield won the Davey O’Brien and Maxwell awards on his way to the 2017 Heisman Trophy. Murray, Tagovailoa and Ohio State’s Dwayne Haskins are the three finalists for the Heisman Trophy. It will be given out Saturday night in New York City. Tagovailoa has thrown for 3,353 yards, 37 touchdowns to four interceptions and has completed nearly 68 percent of his passes. Murray has thrown for 4,053 yards and 40 touchdowns while rushing for over 800 yards and 11 touchdowns. Murray’s 51 combined touchdowns are the most of anyone in college football. The Walter Camp winner has won the Heisman the last five seasons. The last Maxwell/Davey O’Brien split among quarterbacks came in 2016 when Lamar Jackson won the Maxwell Award and Deshaun Watson won the Davey O’Brien Award. Jackson won the Heisman that season. Tagovailoa has been the presumptive favorite for the Heisman throughout the season. But his left ankle injury and poor performance in the SEC championship game and Murray’s great Big 12 championship game performance has made the Oklahoma QB the sportsbook favorite heading into Saturday night.
