She gained recognition for portraying Wonder Woman in the DC Extended Universe films (2016–2023). In 2018, Gadot was named one of Time ' s 100 most influential people and ranked by Forbes as the tenth-highest-paid actress, later rising to third in 2020. She became the first Israeli actor to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2025. Gadot grew up in Rosh HaAyin , and first gained attention locally after winning the Miss Israel 2004 , followed by two years of service in the Israel Defense Forces as a combat trainer. During this time, she participated in a Maxim photo shoot that boosted her public profile. Gadot then began modeling and endorsing various brands. She made her television debut in the Israeli drama Bubot in 2008, followed by her film debut in a supporting role as Gisele Yashar in Fast & Furious (2009), reprising it in multiple sequels. Gadot first portrayed Wonder Woman in Batman v Superman (2016). The success of the film led to her starring in Wonder Woman (2017), which became a major box office hit . She also reprised the role in Justice League (2017) and Wonder Woman 1984 (2020), the latter of which she also co-produced. Since then, she has starred in Red Notice (2021), Death on the Nile (2022), Heart of Stone (2023), which she co-produced, and portrayed the Evil Queen in Snow White (2025). Beyond acting, Gadot and her husband have co-founded a film production company, launched a food brand, and invested in Israeli startups. She is widely celebrated in Israel as a national icon and ambassador. However, her strong support for the Israeli military and her advocacy regarding the hostage crisis have sparked both praise and criticism. Background Gal Gadot was born on 30 April 1985 [ 2 ] in Petah Tikva , [ note 1 ] where she initially lived. [ 9 ] She was born to Jewish parents of Ashkenazi descent; [ 7 ] her mother's roots are Czech and Polish , while  her father's are Austrian , Russian , and German . [ 10 ] Her parents, Michael, an engineer, and Irit, a physical education teacher, [ 11 ] [ 12 ] hebraized their surname from "Greenstein" to "Gadot" before her birth. [ 13 ] In Hebrew, her first name means "wave", and her surname translates to "riverbanks". [ 6 ] She has a younger sister, Dana. [ 14 ] Her father is a sixth-generation Sabra , [ 15 ] and one of his ancestors was the first chemist at Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem, [ 16 ] while her mother is a first-generation Sabra and the daughter of Holocaust survivors . [ 14 ] [ 5 ] Her maternal grandfather, [ 5 ] Abraham Weiss, [ 17 ] was born as Adolf Weiss, [ 18 ] in the village of Munkács , [ 19 ] Czechoslovakia in 1928. At 13, when Nazi Germany invaded , his father died in the army and  he, his mother, and his brother were sent to Auschwitz , where the latter two perished in the gas chamber . Gadot's maternal grandmother, however, managed to escape Europe before World War II . [ 20 ] [ 15 ] [ 17 ] Abraham immigrated alone to Jaffa , where he built a life. He later served in the Golani Brigade , and in his later years, he joined Israel Defense Forces (IDF) expeditions to share his first hand Holocaust testimony . [ 21 ] In 1993, at the age of eight, Gadot and her family moved to the Givat Tal neighborhood of Rosh HaAyin , where she grew up, [ 22 ] [ 8 ] [ 15 ] in what she described as a "very Jewish, Israeli family environment". [ 14 ] As a child, she struggled with a weak voice and attended speech therapy , where she learned proper breathing techniques . [ 23 ] Encouraged by her mother to be active from a young age, Gadot took up swimming at four and later played tennis. [ 15 ] She joined the local volleyball and basketball teams, [ 24 ] soccer-team cheerleader , [ 19 ] and trained in ballet, hip-hop, and jazz for 12 years, at one point considering a career as a choreographer. [ 14 ] At 11, she visited Holocaust memorial sites in Poland to learn about Auschwitz and Majdanek . Reflecting on the experience, she recalled: "I, an entitled child, felt the suffering the Muselmann experienced back then." [ 25 ] At 12, she was invited to enter the Girl of the Year [ he ] ( Hebrew : נערת השנה ‎ ) competition but declined, saying, "Ugh, modeling? I'm much smarter and deeper. I won't make a living from posing for the camera." However, reflecting on that decision later, she acknowledged, "when I grew up, I realized that it's a job and that it's also fun—you make great money, meet fascinating people, and visit interesting places." [ 24 ] Although Gadot's native language is Hebrew , she started taking English lessons in third grade and became fluent when she decided she wanted to watch Seinfeld and Friends . [ 26 ] She later attended Begin High School, where she majored in biology. [ 25 ] After graduating, she had a few months before beginning her mandatory two-year service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). During this time, she received modeling offers but instead chose to work at Burger King , saying, "I was like, posing for money? Ugh, it's not for me." Meanwhile, her mother and a friend submitted an application on her behalf for the Miss Israel pageant. [ 15 ] Before enlisting, she also worked as a caregiver for eight-month-old twins. [ 25 ] Career 2004–2009: Miss Israel, IDF service and early work "It wasn't my love for fashion or glamour that led me there. My enlistment [in the army] had been postponed by six months, and all my friends were already in uniform. My mother suggested I try out [Miss Israel], so I went through the selection process, met wonderful girls, and thought, 'Why not? It will be fun, and I'll get one last trip abroad before the army.' I figured it would make for a good story to tell my future grandchildren." —Gadot reflecting on her decision to enter the beauty pageant, via a 2008 interview with Ynet [ 24 ] In 2004, the 54th Miss Israel beauty pageant was held at the Haifa Congress Center, [ 27 ] where an 18-year-old Gal Gadot participated with little expectation of winning. However, the 5'10" Gadot, [ 25 ] was crowned Miss Israel by Sivan Klein , and Yona Yahav , [ 28 ] and received a Citroën C3 supermini car. [ 29 ] Following her win, Gadot represented Israel in the Miss Universe 2004 pageant in Ecuador but admitted she intentionally "rebelled" to avoid winning, arriving late to events and refusing to wear an evening gown. [ 30 ] Before stepping down from her pageant title, Gadot emphasized the importance of serving in the Israeli army, saying, "Serving in the army is an integral part of the lives of the youth here [in Israel]. Beyond my contribution, I believe that this period will contribute greatly to me as well." [ 31 ] In 2005, a week after passing on the crown, [ 32 ] Gadot, at 20, [ 33 ] was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces. After excelling in a three-month boot camp, [ 34 ] she went on to serve as a combat trainer, teaching soldiers gymnastics and calisthenics . [ 35 ] Reporting daily at 5 a.m., she led soldiers through a form of boot camp. [ 15 ] Gadot became so passionate about the techniques she learned that she eventually trained sergeants and high-ranking commanders . [ 36 ] Gadot also trained in Krav Maga , [ 37 ] gaining proficiency in handling weapons and preparing for combat. [ 36 ] She completed her mandatory two-year service , of which only 20 days were in uniform. [ 38 ] Reflecting on her military experience in a 2016 interview with Fashion , Gadot said, "It was demanding because you give up your freedom for two years, but there is something special in giving back to your community." [ 36 ] In 2007, while still serving, 21-year-old Gadot appeared in Maxim ' s "Women of the Israel Defense Forces" photo shoot, [ 39 ] which was later featured on the cover of the New York Post . [ 40 ] The shoot was part of a campaign by Israel's consulate in New York, Maxim , and the Ministry of Tourism to "promote Israel, attract young American men, and reshape its public image". [ 39 ] The campaign faced criticism, particularly from Knesset members, over the portrayal of female soldiers in bikinis. [ 41 ] Reflecting on the criticism, Gadot stated in a 2013 Forward interview, "I'm a model, not a doctor. My job is to take pictures in a bathing suit. There's nothing provocative about that." [ 42 ] After the issue was released in July 2007, [ 42 ] the shoot significantly boosted her public profile, [ 43 ] [ 44 ] and as a result, she landed an international campaign for "Prada Ellis" perfume. [ 31 ] That same year, [ 45 ] she began pursuing law and international studies [ 46 ] at IDC Herzliya (now Reichman University). [ 31 ] She attributed this decision to being "so deep", and because she "loved" Ally McBeal . [ 15 ] After her first year, a casting director from London contacted Gadot's agent after seeing her modeling card on the agency's wall, which led her to audition for the role of Camille Montes in the James Bond film Quantum of Solace . [ 34 ] [ 47 ] In a 2017 interview with W Magazine , Gadot recalled her initial reaction to the role, saying she felt "too serious and smart to be an actress" because of her studies and was not comfortable speaking in English. [ 46 ] Her agent encouraged her to go, saying, "Just go, please, out of respect." Gadot shared that the casting director helped her, and she went through several callbacks. [ 47 ] Although she lost the role to Olga Kurylenko , [ 34 ] Gadot found the experience "interesting" and told her agents to let her know if any other opportunities came up that might be a better fit for her. [ 47 ] She dropped out of IDC Herzliya, [ 48 ] [ 49 ] and, two months later, made her acting debut in the Israeli drama Bubot . [ 47 ] She recalled that on the first day of classes, she received a call informing her that she had landed the lead role of Miriam. [ 24 ] She later performed in Festigal Underwater , an annual Israeli musical show for kids during Hanukkah , where she performed as a mermaid , acting, singing, and dancing. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Three months after her audition for Quantum of Solace , the same casting director recommended Gadot to Universal Studios and contacted her about a role in Fast & Furious . [ 47 ] [ 52 ] She was asked to "urgently" send a filmed audition to Los Angeles, which was well received. As a result, the studio flew Gadot and her agent, the CEO of the Look agency [ he ] (now ADD agency), to LA for a personal meeting with Vin Diesel , the film's star, who would decide whether she got the part. [ 52 ] Gadot was ultimately chosen over six other actresses for the supporting role of Gisele Yashar in the fourth film of the franchise. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Reflecting on the audition process, Gadot mentioned working with Israeli acting coach Orit Shar [ he ] , describing their preparation as "serious and thorough." She recalled, "The director [ Justin Lin ] was impressed with the work we did on the character. We built a backstory based on the six scenes they sent me, and he liked the direction we took". [ 24 ] Filming took about a month. [ 24 ] After filming wrapped in 2008, Gadot signed with Endeavor , becoming the only Israeli represented by the agency. [ 24 ] Later that year, she signed with ICM agency and One management. [ 56 ] After Fast & Furious was released in 2009, Gadot reflected on her success saying, "I can't believe this happened to me..I have more luck than intelligence." [ 57 ] That same year, she made a brief appearance in the TV series Entourage [ 58 ] in the episode titled " Amongst Friends ", portraying Lisa, a date of the main character, Vincent Chase . [ 59 ] She also appeared on the American teen drama, The Beautiful Life: TBL . [ 60 ] 2010–2016: Breakthrough as Wonder Woman In 2010, Gadot had small roles in the action-adventure comedy Knight and Day and the action comedy Date Night , [ 61 ] which took her five days to film her scenes with Mark Wahlberg . [ 38 ] In 2011, Gadot reprising her role as Gisele in Fast Five . [ 62 ] Gadot explained that giving Gisele a Mossad background allowed for character development across multiple films. She also believes director Lin appreciated her Israeli military experience, saying "I think Justin [Lin] really liked that I had served in the Israeli military and wanted to incorporate my knowledge of weapons into the role". [ 42 ] Later that year, she appeared in the second season of the Israeli series Asfur , playing Kiki, a coffee shop owner in Amsterdam. [ 63 ] In 2012, she starred the Israeli drama, Kathmandu , set in Nepal, the series follows a Chabad couple running a sanctuary for Jewish travelers. [ 64 ] Sources in the industry estimate that Gadot earned over NIS3,000 (approximately US$800) per day of filming. [ 65 ] In 2013, she returned to the Fast & Furious franchise, reprising her character in Fast & Furious 6 , [ 62 ] where she performed some of her own stunt work in the film. [ 66 ] In May 2013, Gadot revealed in an interview with Reshet that she was offered a role in a Disney film but turned it down due to the requirement of shaving her head. It has been speculated that the role may have been for the MCU 's Nebula . [ 67 ] In November 2013, Variety reported that Gadot, along with other actresses, had tested for the role of Wonder Woman. [ 68 ] In December 2013, Gadot was confirmed for the role in the untitled Batman v Superman movie alongside Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck , directed by Zack Snyder . [ 69 ] [ 70 ] The contract for her portrayal of Wonder Woman was managed by her then-agent, ADD agency, which represented Gadot both in Israel and internationally. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] She left the agency in 2019 on good terms. [ 73 ] Reflecting on her audition for the role in a 2016 Variety interview, Gadot described the process as "super intensive, nerve-racking, a long roller coaster". While in Los Angeles, Warner Bros . invited her to audition for an undisclosed role with Snyder. Later, her agent informed her she would be testing with Affleck. Finally, Snyder called and asked, "Have you ever heard of Wonder Woman?" After a successful camera test with Affleck and weeks of waiting, Gadot was offered the role. Overwhelmed with joy, she called herself "the luckiest girl in the world." [ 47 ] Before landing the role, Gadot shared her frustration with the constant rejection she faced while auditioning in Los Angeles. In a Sunday Today interview with Willie Geist , she said, "There's so much no," explaining that after a few Fast & Furious films, she considered quitting acting, feeling discouraged and as though she was dragging her family along. She also explained that acting was not something she had dreamed of as a child. Instead, the opportunity came to her, saying, "I started to become more curious about it, and then I fell in love with the profession." [ 74 ] In a similar reflection during a The Hollywood Reporter interview, Gadot said she struggled to gain traction,  saying, "I had so many almosts for big, great things, but I was never big enough of a name." She recalled being the runner-up for the role of Imperator Furiosa , which ultimately went to Charlize Theron in Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), explaining, "It was always me and the big name." [ 75 ] [ 76 ] In June 2014, she signed a three-picture deal with Warner Bros. to appear as Wonder Woman, reportedly earning $300,000 per film. [ 77 ] Gadot, speaking at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2014 for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice at the San Diego Convention Center . In July 2014, Gadot's portrayal of Wonder Woman was unveiled at Comic-Con during the Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice panel . Despite prior criticism of her physique, she stated that she had trained to build muscle for the role, moving beyond her previous Fast & Furious image. [ 78 ] To prepare, she took lessons in swordsmanship , Kung Fu , kickboxing , capoeira and Brazilian jiu-jitsu , [ 79 ] gaining 17 pounds of muscle. She also explained that she "trained six hours a day for six months—two hours of gym work, two hours of fight choreography, and up to two hours of horseback riding. It was much more intense than the army." [ 80 ] That same year, Gadot landed her first Israeli film role in the comedy Kicking Out Shoshana , playing lead character Mirit Ben-Harush. [ 81 ] Later that year, she was offered the lead role in the Hollywood remake of Ben-Hur (2016) but had to decline due to scheduling conflicts with Batman v Superman . [ 82 ] Prior to her debut as Wonder Woman, Gadot revealed she had previously been offered the role of Faora-Ul in Man of Steel (2013) , but turned it down due to her pregnancy, leading to Antje Traue being cast instead. [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] In 2016, Gadot officially debuted as Wonder Woman in the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice . Gadot's performance as the superhero, the character's first film appearance, was singled out by The Guardian as one of the film's best parts. [ 86 ] Her portrayal of Wonder Woman quickly became a defining role in her career, with critics praising her for bringing strength, grace, and a refreshing depth to the character. Critics particularly noted how she brought a strong sense of empowerment and integrity to the role, setting a new standard for female superheroes in mainstream cinema. [ 87 ] She then had a small role in John Hillcoat 's crime-thriller Triple 9 , where she starred along with Kate Winslet and Aaron Paul . [ 88 ] Later that year, she co-starred in the action crime thriller film Criminal , as the wife of Ryan Reynolds ' character, alongside Kevin Costner , Gary Oldman , and Tommy Lee Jones . [ 89 ] She described the film as the most challenging project she had done to date. [ 36 ] Her final film of the year was the action comedy Keeping Up with the Joneses , in which she played a secret agent, alongside Zach Galifianakis , Jon Hamm , and Isla Fisher . [ 90 ] Critic Alex Welch wrote on IGN about Gadot's performance: "the script unfortunately banks mostly on her looks and deadly skills as a spy for her jokes, but Gadot manages to make it work." [ 91 ] 2017–2020: Wonder Woman solo films and production ventures Cast of Wonder Woman at the Los Angeles premiere, from left to right: Danny Huston , Chris Pine , Gadot, director Patty Jenkins , Elena Anaya , and Robin Wright . In 2017, Gadot starred in a solo film for her character, Wonder Woman , which was paid $300,000. This figure sparked some controversy, as it was significantly lower than the salaries commanded by many male action stars in Hollywood. [ 92 ] However, the film received a positive response from critics, with some calling it the best installment in the DC Extended Universe . Praise was directed at Patty Jenkins 's direction, the chemistry between Gadot and Chris Pine , the musical score, and the thrilling action sequences. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Due to her former service in the IDF, the film has been banned in Lebanon , Kuwait , Jordan , and in several other Middle Eastern countries. [ 95 ] [ 96 ] She then reprised the role in the ensemble film Justice League , which was released in November 2017, and was her third DC Extended Universe installment. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] [ 99 ] During the film's production under director Joss Whedon , she alleged that Whedon verbally abused her and "threatened" her career. In response, she stated in an interview that she took the matter to the heads of Warner Bros., who "took care of it". [ 100 ] That same year, Gadot was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences . [ 101 ] Gadot then voiced the character Shank, who was modeled after her, in the Walt Disney Animation Studios film, Ralph Breaks the Internet . [ 102 ] [ 103 ] The film's co-director, Phil Johnston , praised Gadot's performance. [ 103 ] In 2018, appeared in the music video for Maroon 5 's song " Girls Like You " featuring Cardi B . [ 104 ] In January 2020, National Geographic announced Impact with Gal Gadot . The six-part documentary series , executive produced by Gadot and her husband, highlights young women overcoming poverty, violence, and discrimination to create positive change in their communities, [ 105 ] [ 106 ] premiered in April 2021 across National Geographic's digital and social platforms. [ 107 ] Gadot returned as Wonder Woman in Wonder Woman 1984 (2020), for which she reportedly earned $10 million. [ 92 ] The sequel to her 2017 solo film was released on 25 December 2020, both in theaters and on the HBO Max streaming platform due to the COVID-19 pandemic. [ 108 ] The film received praise for Gadot's performance and the visual effects; however, it garnered mixed reviews from critics, with some finding the plot overly complex and less impactful than the first film. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] 2021–present: Streaming projects In November 2021, Gadot starred alongside Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds in the Netflix action comedy film Red Notice , written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber . [ 111 ] The Guardian , in its review, opined that Gadot was "sleepwalking through the motions" and was "adept only when fighting". [ 112 ] The film, however became Netflix's most-watched film ever, as reported by Bloomberg . The film has over 328 million hours streamed in its first three weeks. This equates to 164 million accounts watching it in full, making it the most-watched new movie of 2021. [ 113 ] The following year, she co-starred with Kenneth Branagh , Armie Hammer , Ali Fazal , Tom Bateman , and Annette Bening in the 2022 mystery film Death on the Nile , which was also directed by Branagh. [ 114 ] Los Angeles Times' chief film critic Justin Chang deemed her "underwhelming" in the film, [ 115 ] while The Week ' s Jesse Hassenger defends Gadot's performance addressing the widespread criticism she received for her portrayal of Linnet Doyle, particularly for a meme-worthy line delivery. [ 116 ] The film was banned in Tunisia following protests over Gadot's Israeli military service and her support for Israel's 2014 Gaza offensive . [ 117 ] This decision, followed by bans in Kuwait and Lebanon, reflects longstanding support for the Palestinian cause. [ 118 ] In 2023, Gadot made uncredited cameo appearances as Wonder Woman in Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash . [ 119 ] [ 120 ] [ 121 ] [ 122 ] She also returned to the Fast & Furious franchise with a cameo appearance in Fast X . [ 123 ] Later that year, she was offered the role of Barbie in Barbie , but she was unavailable. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] Later that year, she played the lead role of a double agent in Netflix's action film Heart of Stone . [ 126 ] This film is Gadot and her husband's first project developed and produced through their company, Pilot Wave, which they began developing in 2018. She called it an "extremely empowering and educational experience". [ 127 ] The film however, received mostly negative reviews, with Owen Gleiberman stating: "Gadot is game, but there's a slightly downbeat earnestness about her that doesn't mesh with the reflexive quippiness of the dialogue." [ 128 ] Despite negative reception, the film emerged as Netflix's second-most-watched film in the second half of 2023, with nearly 110 million views. [ 129 ] Gadot next starred as the Evil Queen in a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . [ 130 ] In an interview with GQ , she recalled "It was the first time I had to audition for a project in a while, Disney needed to ensure I could sing because it's a musical. So I worked on the song for a month, auditioned, filmed the song, and then I got the role. It was very exciting." [ 131 ] She also had her own personal dialect coach for the role. [ 132 ] In August 2024, calls from pro-Palestinian activists to boycott Disney's Snow White remake emerged due to Gadot's support for Israel. [ 133 ] [ 134 ] [ 135 ] In March 2025, it was reported that Disney assigned bodyguards to Gadot after she received death threats linked to co-star Rachel Zegler 's " Free Palestine " post during Snow White ' s promotional campaign. [ 136 ] Producer Marc Platt attempted to mediate with Zegler, who refused to retract her post. Meanwhile, Gadot, as reported by Variety , avoided political commentary, "focusing instead on humanitarian issues by supporting Gaza hostages and distancing her posts from the film's promotion". [ 137 ] Gadot's performance in the film was noted to showcase her potential as a villain, but reviews were divided. Some praised her portrayal, while others criticized her musical number, "All Is Fair", and her limited emotional range. [ 138 ] Other endeavors Endorsements and modeling Before enlisting in the Israeli army, she worked briefly as a model in Milan . She then returned to Israel and continued modeling while serving in the military. [ 139 ] In 2007, following the Maxim "Women of the Israel Defense Forces" photoshoot, Gadot's public image gained significant attention, [ 43 ] leading her to promote various products, appear in numerous advertisements, and feature in several magazines. She first landed an international campaign for Prada Ellis perfume. [ 31 ] She then became a spokesmodel for the Israeli clothing brand Castro , [ 140 ] a role she held for over 11 seasons, reportedly earning about $100,000 per season. [ 43 ] [ 140 ] In 2010, Gadot walked the runway for Castro's summer collection fashion show at Tel Aviv Port . [ 141 ] After welcoming her first child in 2012, she returned to the runway for Castro's annual fashion show that year. [ 142 ] The following year, after promoting Fast & Furious 6 , she once again graced the runway for Castro's winter collection. [ 143 ] In 2015, she walked for Castro's "Hipster Shanty" summer collection. [ 144 ] In 2013, Castro CEO Gabi Rotter noted that Gadot was not widely known when she was chosen but was the "perfect fit to represent Israeli beauty". He cited her background as both an IDF soldier and a beauty pageant contestant as key factors in her selection, following in the footsteps of Israeli models like Yael Abecassis and Sendi Bar . [ 43 ] In December 2013, Gadot signed a two-year contract with the Israeli skincare company Carline. According to Ofer Yaar from the advertising agency Bruckner Neta Yaar, Gadot was selected as the spokesmodel because she embodies the brand's values, being "local and international, she exudes simplicity and accessibility, and she is your best friend, even when she is Wonder Woman." [ 43 ] In 2015 she became the face of Gucci Bamboo. [ 145 ] In 2018, Reebok announced an endorsement deal  with Gadot, reported to be worth $10 million (NIS 34 million). [ 146 ] She also became a brand ambassador for Huawei , which led to controversy after she tweeted a promotional video using an Apple device. Gadot explained that the mistake was made by a member of her publicity team, who posted the video from the wrong phone. [ 147 ] Gadot behind the scenes of Revlon's "Live Boldly" campaign Additionally, Revlon recognized Gadot's influence, naming her the global ambassador for their "Live Boldly" campaign. [ 148 ] [ 149 ] Revlon's global brand president, Anne Talley, praised Gadot as a symbol of "feminine strength and beauty", aligning with the campaign's message of empowerment and inclusivity. [ 150 ] Fabian Garcia, Revlon's President & CEO, emphasized that Gadot represent "the beauty, determination and attitude that reflect what it is for women to live boldly in today's world". [ 151 ] However, Gadot's association with the brand sparked criticism, notably from Muslim blogger Amani Al-Khatahtbeh , who rejected Revlon's "Changemaker Award" due to Gadot's support for the IDF. [ 152 ] In 2019, Gadot starred in commercials alongside Hot 's popular stars, promoting the brand's "Israeli pride" campaign.

[ 156 ] Production ventures In October 2019, Gadot formed a film and television production company, Pilot Wave, with her husband Jaron "Yaron" Varsano. [ 157 ] [ 158 ] Reflecting on the decision Gadot stated in a 2023 interview with L'Oréal , "the whole idea of starting the production company with my husband was to be in control of my own destiny. I'm not the type of person who likes to sit and wait for the next offer." [ 159 ] Since then, she has shared teasers for different projects—some got mixed reactions, but none have been released. [ 160 ] In November 2021, Gadot and her husband launched Goodles, a mac and cheese brand co-founded with "experienced partners" like former Kraft brand executive Paul Earle, with the goal of offering a healthier alternative to traditional boxed mac and cheese.

This investment is part of their ongoing support for Israeli startups, following a previous investment in K Health . [ 162 ] Reception Media reception Gadot initially faced criticism for her slim physique during her pageant years in 2004, with some even speculating about eating disorders . [ 163 ] She dismissed these remarks, pointing out that they stemmed from unrealistic beauty standards. [ 164 ] According to Ynet , early in her career, she was considered a "shelf product", a term for a model struggling to break through in the local fashion scene. Fashion photographer Alon Shefransky—who worked with her from 2006 to 2008—described her turning point from a softer, "baby-faced look" to a more toned, defined appearance as a "wow moment", likening it to "discovering the next Natalie Portman " [ 43 ] By 2012, Gadot ranked second on Forbes Israel ' s list of top-earning models, with earnings of NIS 1.3 million (approximately US$ 350,000), and in 2013, her earnings rose to NIS2.4 million (approximately US$650,000), driven largely by brand endorsements and her role in Fast & Furious .

[ 168 ] [ 169 ] Ahead of Wonder Woman's 2017 release, Gadot received 95% positive online comments, with Taykey analytics ranking her as the most beloved Israeli globally. [ 170 ] Taykey's CEO, Amit Avner, noted that Gadot had already been the most talked-about personality during Super Bowl commercials , one of which she appeared in earlier that year. However, the release of Wonder Woman would elevated her popularity to new heights. [ 170 ] That same year Forbes Israel ranked 35th on their list of "Influential Women", [ 171 ] and ranked 53rd on Forbes "30 Under 30 list". [ 172 ] Additionally, she topped FHM ' s " 100 Sexiest Women in the World " list. [ 173 ] That same year, she became the third highest-grossing actress of 2017, earning $1.4 billion worldwide. [ 174 ] In her January 2018, article for The Forward , Jenny Singer critiques how Gadot is portrayed in the media, particularly on the cover of Vanity Fair . Despite Gadot's "success as an actress, activist, and athlete", Singer argues that she is often reduced to a sex object , with her talents overshadowed by her physical appearance. Singer suggests that Gadot's background, including her modeling past and accent, may contribute to the media's focus on her looks rather than her accomplishments. [ 175 ] That year, Time magazine named Gadot one of the 100 most influential people in the world , [ 176 ] and Forbes ranked her as the tenth highest-paid actress in the world, with annual earnings of $10 million. [ 177 ] In 2020, Forbes ranked Gadot as the third highest-paid actress in the world, with annual earnings of $31.5 million. [ 178 ] In 2022, Variety reported that Gadot earned $5 million for her role in Death on the Nile . She was the highest-paid star in the movie. [ 179 ] In 2023, Gadot was awarded the LifeSaver Award by ELEM/Youth in Distress in Israel. [ 180 ] In June of that year, it was announced that Gadot would become the first Israeli actor to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. [ 181 ] [ 182 ] This was met with criticism, [ 183 ] [ 184 ] and by March 18, 2025, she officially received it. The ceremony was disrupted by both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protesters. [ 185 ] [ 186 ] Cultural reception In her honor, the Azrieli Center in Tel Aviv was illuminated on 1 June 2017, ahead of the Israeli premiere of Wonder Woman . The towers displayed the message: "We are proud of you, Gal Gadot, our Wonder Woman." [ 187 ] In Tel Aviv, a Wonder Woman poster featuring Gal Gadot with the Hebrew phrase "We love you!" in the upper left corner. [ 188 ] As reported by CBC News , Gadot's portrayal of Wonder Woman has made her "the world's most famous Israeli and the country's most high-profile ambassador ". Gadot has been compared to Bar Refaeli , who faced backlash for not serving in the military. Gadot is admired for her military service, which has endeared her to Israelis. Her image as a "good Israeli" and her inspiring presence in Wonder Woman have made her a source of "national Israeli pride", with fans cheering and even crying at her appearances. [ 188 ] Isabel Feinstein of The Jerusalem Post praised Gadot as a powerful example of " soft power " for Israel, highlighting how her rise to global fame offers the " Jewish state " a unique opportunity for positive international exposure. Feinstein highlighted that Gadot's Google search results (20.7 million) surpass those of Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu (16.1 million), emphasizing her global influence. [ 189 ] She also noted that Gadot's appearances on Western talk shows like The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and The Ellen DeGeneres Show have helped humanize the stereotype of the "brutal Israeli soldier", making her relatable to a worldwide audience. Feinstein went on to describe Gadot as "a living contradiction", claiming that "the association of an Israeli actress with a progressive agenda helps those who unfairly condemn all citizens of a nation for the actions of their government see that Israelis are complex and open-minded humans with a wide range of opinions". [ 189 ] In a 2019 article by The Australian Jewish News , it is highlighted that Gadot is often seen as a more effective ambassador for Israel than its diplomats, given her global fame. Ari Ingel of the Creative Community for Peace believes her interactions with prominent Hollywood figures can positively influence Israel's image. However, Shayna Weiss of Brandeis University views this as a "soft power" issue—using culture to sway opinions—and questions whether such influence has measurable or lasting effects, saying, "I don't think Gal Gadot harms Israel, but do I think Gal Gadot helps Israel much? Not so sure." [ 190 ] The release of the film sparked a debate about Gadot's Jewish identity and her portrayal as a woman of color . [ 191 ] Some argued that as an Israeli Jew , Gadot should be seen through the lens of racial complexity, in the claims that Hollywood has historically limited representation of diverse identities. [ 192 ] Critics argued Wonder Woman was a breakthrough for white women but lacked representation for women of color. [ 193 ] In contrast, others viewed Gadot's role as a positive step toward broader representation, especially for Jewish women, Israeli heritage, distinct accent, and strength as a heroic figure. [ 191 ] Tamar Hermann reflected on Gadot's portrayal, noting that Jewish women are often underrepresented or stereotyped in Hollywood. For many, Gadot's role offered a rare and empowering representation of Jewish women, highlighting her Israeli heritage, distinct accent, and strength as a heroic figure. [ 194 ] Some argued that Black women's support for the film ignored Gadot's ties to the IDF and her stance on Palestinian oppression warning it could complicate issues of White feminism , anti-Black racism , and racial capitalism , calling for a more nuanced view of the film's cultural significance . [ 195 ] President Reuven Rivlin with Gadot at the Justice League (2017) premiere at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles. [ 196 ] During his visit to Los Angeles for the General Assembly of the Jewish Federations , Israeli President Reuven Rivlin was invited by Gadot to the premiere of Justice League , a film in which she stars. Rivlin embraced Gadot, expressing his pride in her as a "true ambassador" of Israel, "who has managed to place us [Israeli] at the pinnacles of global filmmaking with grace, values, and an Israeli smile." [ 197 ] In June 2018, amid an Arab boycott of Gadot, a cinema in the northern Israeli town of Nazareth Illit was named "Gal Cinema" in her honor. The two-screen cinema opened with the film Shelter by Israeli director Eran Riklis . The spokeswoman Orna Yosef stated the decision aimed to inspire young people, highlighting Gadot as a symbol of success and the fulfillment of dreams. [ 198 ] On November 7, 2022, Gadot was honored at the Israeli Culture & Arts (ICA) Awards by the America-Israel Cultural Foundation (AICF). The award recognized her significant contributions to film, alongside other Israeli artists. [ 199 ] In May 2023, Gadot received an award for "extraordinary achievements" at an event celebrating Israel's 75th Independence Day in Los Angeles, organized by the Israeli-American Community (IAC) and the Israeli Consulate . In her speech, Gadot expressed pride in her Israeli heritage and emphasized the importance of strengthening ties between Israelis and Americans . [ 200 ] In January 2025 Dudi Caspi, Israel's representative to the Golden Globes Association , spoke with Iris Cole on 103FM radio about the ceremony. He praised Gadot, calling her "a good ambassador for Israel". Caspi noted that although Gadot did not wear a hostages pin at the event, she remains an important figure for Israel in Hollywood. [ 201 ] In March 2025, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) awarded Gadot a "Certificate of Appreciation" for her strong stance against anti-Semitism and hatred, and her unwavering support for Israel and Jewish communities worldwide. [ 202 ] Advocacy Gadot identifies as a feminist and promotes women's empowerment. [ 203 ] In July 2016, Gadot joined a campaign by Israeli female master's students in communications to rebrand Israel by highlighting its strong women. Titled "Israel Creates Wonder Women," the campaign promotes female strength, opportunity, and influence in Israel. It features "real-life Israeli heroines," including an air force pilot, a doctor, and a businesswoman, etc. Gadot supported the initiative after the students reached out to her. [ 204 ] Left to right: Patty Jenkins, Gadot, and Lynda Carter in 2017. Later In 2016, Gadot, fellow Wonder Woman actress Lynda Carter , DC Entertainment President Diane Nelson , director Patty Jenkins and U.N. Under-Secretary-General Cristina Gallach appeared at the United Nations on 21 October 2016, the 75th anniversary of the first appearance of Wonder Woman, to mark the character's designation by the United Nations as its "Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Women and Girls". [ 205 ] [ 206 ] The gesture was intended to raise awareness of UN Sustainable Development Goal No. 5, which seeks to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls by 2030. [ 205 ] [ 206 ] [ 207 ] The decision was met with protests from UN staff members who stated in their petition to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that the character is "not culturally encompassing or sensitive" and served to objectify women. As a result, the character was stripped of the designation, and the project ended on 16 December. [ 207 ] In a January 2018, interview with Women's Wear Daily , she highlighted Hollywood's ongoing cultural shift towards gender equality , calling it necessary and overdue. [ 203 ] Later, Gadot joined the #WeRemember campaign after receiving a personal request from Toby Levy, an 84-year-old Holocaust survivor who asked Gadot on Twitter to help preserve the memory of the Holocaust. Gadot responded by posting a photo with the hashtag, joining over 1.5 million people worldwide in the campaign organized by the World Jewish Congress . CEO Robert Singer praised her participation, noting the crucial role influencers play in raising awareness of antisemitism . [ 208 ] That same year, she attended the Golden Globes , where she joined fellow actors in wearing black to support the Time's Up movement.

Gadot visited the children at their hotel, Sportsmen's Lodge, sharing breakfast and answering their questions. [ 211 ] In November 2020, Gadot faced backlash after congratulating Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on their election win . It drew criticism from Trump supporters and others who accused her of being a populist and a "Hollywood liberal who has forgotten what is good for her country." Some also labeled her hypocritical and ungrateful, including Israeli rapper Yoav Eliasi , who publicly condemned her support for Biden. [ 212 ] In October 2022 Gadot faced backlash after posting support for the Jewish community amid Kanye West's "anti-Semitic" remarks . After staying silent for a long time, she shared an Instagram photo with a Star of David necklace and the word "proud". While many praised her for speaking out, others accused her of using the moment for publicity, pointing out her previous silence on Israel-related issues, while others praised her for speaking out. [ 213 ] In April 2023, Gadot hosted a special Holocaust Remembrance Day event at her Hollywood home, where she welcomed Holocaust survivors like Celina Biniaz, the youngest survivor of Schindler's List , along with notable Hollywood guests. The event was part of the " Zikaron BaSalon " tradition, which translates to "living room memories" and involves survivors sharing their testimonies in intimate settings. Gadot reflected on the event, saying, "I don't know about God, but I believe in people, in the power of one's decision to do good." [ 214 ] [ 215 ] In May 2023, she surprised children from the "Lend a Hand" organization during a visit to Universal Studios in Los Angeles. [ 216 ] During 2025 California wildfires , Gadot voiced her support for those affected by the fires in Los Angeles. [ 217 ] Support for Israel Main article: Israeli–Palestinian conflict Gadot has openly supported the Israeli military and considers it her duty as a public figure to advocate for Israel. [ 218 ] Her stance has received both praise and criticism. During the 2014 Gaza War , [ 219 ] Gadot posted on Facebook a picture of herself and her daughter praying in front of Shabbat candles in support of the IDF. She expressed her prayers for Israeli citizens and soldiers and condemned Hamas , whom she called "cowards" hiding behind women and children. [ 220 ] The post sparked both support and criticism due to differing views on the conflict. [ 221 ] In 2019, Gadot clashed with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu over the status of Israel's Arab minority. After Netanyahu's remark that Israel is a " nation-state " for Jews only, actress Rotem Sela criticized it, calling for equality for all. Gadot, defending Sela, emphasized, It's about "peace, equality, and tolerance". Her comments sparked mixed reactions, with some praising her stance and others urging a clearer political position. [ 222 ] During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis , Gadot initially stayed silent which led to criticism from Israeli and Jewish media, [ 223 ] Gadot later called for peace in a statement that sparked widespread backlash. While expressing support for Israel, she referred to Palestinians as "neighbors" rather than naming them directly, which many saw as downplaying their suffering. [ 224 ] [ 225 ] [ 226 ] Yair Netanyahu , son of the Israeli prime minister, criticized her neutrality, arguing that, as Israel's most known figure, she should have taken a stronger stance. He compared her to Bella and Gigi Hadid , who are vocal in their pro-Palestinian support, saying Gadot acted "as if she was from Switzerland" instead of strongly supporting Israel. [ 227 ] Israeli nationalists also expressed disappointment, believing she should have used her global influence to defend Israel more strongly. [ 227 ] In 2022, following several attacks, including the Bnei Brak and Tel Aviv shooting attacks, Gadot remained silent, which led to criticism from her Israeli media and fans. [ 228 ] [ 229 ] [ 230 ] Rapper Yoav Eliasi specifically criticized Gadot, comparing her to the Hadid sisters, and demanding Gadot speak on the attacks. [ 231 ] However, Gadot's mother, Irit Gadot, addressed the matter publicly, defending her daughter.

[ 234 ] In October 2023, during the Israel–Hamas war , Gadot posted a story on her Instagram stating, "Killing innocent Palestinians is horrific", alongside condemning the killing of Israelis. This led to criticism from some in Israel, [ 235 ] particularly from rapper Yoav Eliasi, who called her a "repulsive woman" for equating the killing of Israelis with that of Palestinians, accusing her of not understanding the gravity of the situation or the nature of the violence Israel was facing. [ 236 ] This followed by Israeli journalist Ofira Assayag , who accused Gadot of being out of touch and living in a "Hollywood bubble". [ 235 ] Assayag questioned Gadot's loyalty to Israel, calling her a "disconnected piece of shit", and compared her to other celebrities like Dwayne Johnson and Gigi Hadid, who showed more balanced support for both sides. Gadot later added, "Killing innocent Israelis is horrific. If you don't think the same, I think you need to ask yourself why," but deleted the reference to Palestinians after further backlash. [ 235 ] Later that month, Gadot, along with over 700 Hollywood professionals, signed an open letter condemning the Palestinian militant group Hamas, demanding the release of hostages , and expressing support for Israel. [ 237 ] In November 2023, Gadot continued her advocacy by organizing a screening of Bearing Witness , an Israeli film showing the violence of Hamas, though she did not attend the screening. [ 238 ] Reports stated that 120 people were invited to the event. The Jewish organization Jewish Voice for Peace criticized Gadot and Guy Nativ for screening the film, calling it a "propaganda", claiming the film overlooked the situation in Palestine and served those promoting war and genocide. [ 239 ] In May 2024, Gadot advocated for Eden Golan , Israel's Eurovision representative , publicly encouraging her followers to vote for Golan.

[ 240 ] Later In September 2024, Gadot joined Israeli President Isaac Herzog in launching the "Voice of the People" initiative, aimed at fostering global Jewish unity amidst rising antisemitism and the "ongoing hostage crisis". [ 241 ] [ 242 ] When I look back 15 years, when I was starting out, being Israeli was something that people admired and were excited about—Israeli women, their strength, and all that. I'm not saying it's no longer the case, but now it's complicated. The conversation has changed. It's different. And I find myself, time and again, having to engage in very complex and often uncomfortable discussions with people who have opinions about what's happening, trying to give them the full picture of what's really going on. — Gadot reflecting on shifting views of Israel. [ 243 ] In January 2025, Gadot participated in Noa Tishby 's "#BringOnTheLight" campaign, celebrating Jewish resilience and joy during Hanukkah .

[ 245 ] Some accused her of being silent and hypocritical, including Israeli journalist Ofira Asayag.

She then emphasized her anti-war stance, advocating for love over hate, saying that "I know it sounds cliché, but just as they are teaching us to hate, by increasing antisemitism, we can also teach them to love. I want to believe that love is the force that moves the world. War is a defeat for everyone. Hate is horrible. It is toxic for the outside world and for the hater." [ 248 ] In another interview, she addressed the backlash over her support for Israel, saying she was "shocked by the hate" and was also taken aback "by how the media is not fair many times", which led her to "speak up". She emphasized her advocacy for humanity and hostages, adding, "When your compass is clear, your conscience is clean." [ 249 ] Controversies Main article: Imagine (Gal Gadot video) On 18 March 2020, approximately a week after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic , Gadot and a number of other celebrities, including her Wonder Woman 1984 co-star Kristen Wiig , performed an online version of the song " Imagine " by John Lennon , intended to raise morale.

Gadot has stated in an English-language interview that she was born in Tel Aviv , [ 3 ] though Hebrew-language articles state that she was born in Petah Tikva, [ 4 ] and several English-language sources further support this. [ 5 ] Some have claimed that she was born in Rosh HaAyin, [ 6 ] [ 7 ] but Gadot said that she was only raised there. [ 8 ] ^ While some sources have reported the spelling of her husband's name as "Yaron" [ 34 ] [ 258 ] and others as "Jaron", [ 259 ] he personally uses "Jaron" on his social media accounts and in the production company the couple started.
