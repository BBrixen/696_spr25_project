Find out where his vote was strongest, and which regions favoured his opponent, the Front National’s Marine Le Pen Seán Clarke and Josh Holder Fri 26 May 2017 04.40 EDT First published on Sun 7 May 2017 13.32 EDT Share With 107 of 107 departments counted | At 16:36 CEST Macron 66.1% Le Pen 33.9% Vote share by department 80%+ 70+ 60+ 50+ 50+ 60+ 70+ 80+ Le Pen's heartlands are in the rust belt bordering Belgium and along the Mediterranean coast. But even here, she won a majority in only a few departments. Change in Macron support since first round < 15 15+ 30+ 45+ Macron's vote surged substantially almost everywhere, as it had to do to get him from 24% to over 60%. In the high-unemployment departments along the Belgian border, voters were least tempted by his promise to liberalise the labour market. Change in Le Pen support since first round < 15 15+ 30+ 45+ Le Pen's vote increased most where her vote was already strongest, but even here it grew by much less than Macron's, as supporters of the other first-round candidates found him the more palatable alternative. Percentage of spoiled ballots 0+ 4+ 8+ 12+ In even less bitterly contested French presidential elections, very many French voters turn out and spoil their ballot papers to register discontent with the choices on offer. This year was set to be a record. Abstention rate, per cent <15 15+ 20+ 25+ ... but many other voters expressed their objections passively, by not turning out. The abstention rate (the percentage of registered voters who didn't cast a ballot) was unusually high.
