But then he agreed to work with the FBI to catch his "blacklist" of mobsters, spies and international terrorists -- on the condition that he must work with profiler Elizabeth Keen. Red's true intentions -- choosing Liz, a woman with whom he seemingly has no connection -- are unclear. Does Liz have secrets of her own? Red promises to teach Liz to think like a criminal "to see the bigger picture," whether she wants to or not.

Critics Reviews View All (3) Critics Reviews Debi Enker The Age (Australia) Spader remains the best reason to stay tuned to what is otherwise a fairly pedestrian espionage drama. Mar 23, 2020 Full Review Dale McGarrigle TV Fanatic Best yet, unlike so many "finales" in this coronavirus-ravaged TV season, this felt like a season finale, as Liz was forced to finally choose between her mother Katarina and her surrogate father Red. Rated: 4.6/5 May 18, 2020 Full Review Tim Appelo AARP Movies for Grownups An incredibly twisty, seriocomic mystery show that's part police procedural and part chess game with the audience. Oct 8, 2019 Full Review Read all reviews Audience Reviews View All (40) audience reviews Matt J Liz once again chooses a random stranger claiming to be a relative over the people who contribute positively to her life.   Presumably in Season 8 she commits treason because a televangelist claims to be a maternal cousin 3 times removed. Rated 2.5/5 Stars • Rated 2.5 out of 5 stars 06/17/24 Full Review Krzysztof P S1-9: Czasem wciąga, czasem nuży, czasem denerwuje, czasem zaskoczy. Równia pochyła. Każdy sezon coraz gorszy, mniej satysfakcjonujący i gubią sens Rated 2.5/5 Stars • Rated 2.5 out of 5 stars 02/23/23 Full Review Silver T For crying out loud.... I so enjoyed the show up until season 7.  It went totally spiral downhill from the moment when Katerina (btw, not Katarina, there is no name Katarina in russian) stabbed Red who was trying to warn her and instead of getting information from a friendly person, tried to torture it from him. And then the nurse - it was obvious that she was not genuinely helping Red. Red as a criminal master mind should have caught it. Then Katerina moves in next to Keen and there are no questions as of who that dame is? And why on earth  special FBI unit agents apartments are not being swept for bugs at least every week? And the guys in the car who were supposed to be watching Keen – what were they watching exactly? And Keen – she is the most ridiculous. After what Red is doing for her, she sides with Jennifer who she knows two minutes and with a Blacklister who has the bag of bones, in order to deceive Red and ultimately put him to jail, so Red  would not obstruct their plans to find the who he really is. And we are supposed to sympathize with Jennifer who is seeking retribution for Ian – the very same who killed Tom and other bunch of people? I will skip the show until it recovers. So- no season 8 for me. Looks like season 9 is getting better. We shall see Rated 0.5/5 Stars • Rated 0.5 out of 5 stars 02/21/23 Full Review Sennuh_ I don't get why this season gets shit on this much, i really like this season. To me the blacklist just keeps on getting better. Better cinematics and music choice. I just love it. Rated 4/5 Stars • Rated 4 out of 5 stars 10/24/22 Full Review Audience Member Too many misinformation about political issues. This show has gone down hill starting at season 7 Rated 0.5/5 Stars • Rated 0.5 out of 5 stars 01/09/23 Full Review Tony U Absolute trash, a good show turned into a left propaganda machine!  This is a virtue signaling hypocritical diatribe without regard to common sense or any moral consistency... Just trash and a perfect example of the trajectory of Hollywood's brain washing objective!   What a way to ruin another show that had so much potential, following down the same hole as Homeland, entertaining for a few seasons leading to pure crap!
