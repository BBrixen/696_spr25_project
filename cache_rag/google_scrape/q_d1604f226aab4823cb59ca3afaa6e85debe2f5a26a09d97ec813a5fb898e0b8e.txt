[ 3 ] He married Silvia Hart, with whom he had two children: Llio, an actress and singer, and Andras, an author and martial arts trainer, who died in October 2016.

[ 4 ] He had just completed a two-year term as Vice-President of Plaid Cymru when he was asked to teach Welsh to Prince Charles ahead of his investiture as Prince of Wales .  This took place over nine weeks at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth , prior to the investiture of the Prince of Wales on 1 July 1969. [ 5 ] Millward also served as Plaid's spokesperson on water policy in which role he advocated non-violent direct action against the construction of new reservoirs.

[ 10 ] He was played by Mark Lewis Jones in the Netflix series The Crown where he is shown teaching the Prince of Wales Welsh.
