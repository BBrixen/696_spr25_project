Now taking a look back in time, we can see the development milestones regarding Breath of the Wild, or as it was known back in the day, Zelda Wii U. Using this we can understand how the Zelda team works and how that affects the release of their games, and using that I will try to establish/hypothesize about the sequel's release timing.

It showed off some of the open air gameplay that was previously talked about including "you can even pick apples from the trees", whilst showing off the excellent WiiU gamepad integration.

April 2016: [Kotaku Article Link] In a Nintendo Financial briefing the game is listed as a 2017 title rather than 2016 one, a few months before E3, and it is tweeted that it will release simultaneously for the WiiU and the NX.

[DLC Pass Announced] Nintendo announces the DLC Expansion pass for Breath of the Wild.

The Game Awards 2017: [TGA Champions Ballad Video] On Dec 7, Nintendo release the DLC Pack 2, The Champions Ballad, ending the release of Breath of the Wild content. E3 2019: [BotW2 E3 2019 Trailer] First teaser of the sequel to BotW is shown, using same engine and assets whilst modified. Now as we all know, the sequel to Breath of the Wild was born because the Zelda team had too many ideas regarding the DLC Pack 3 of the expansion pass. Hence, on a conceptual level, what they wanted to do was already finalized when they announced the DLC as a two-pack $19.99 expansion (which was done in February 2017, approx same time the game went gold). It then took them approximately 10 months between announcing the DLC(and BotW going gold) and releasing the final pack, the Champion's Ballad. This means that with conceptual development complete (which took them the whole of WWHD and ALBW for BotW1) they started working on the game full steam from December 2017 . Considering that they had something showable at E3 2013 akin to the teaser they showed in E3 2014, it did not take them more than a year's work to have a presentable alpha build. As for the delays, the first delay in BotW's cycle was due to engine troubles when they probably introduced more complex mechanics, which isn't going to happen this time. The second delay was done to port the game from the WiiU to the Switch, and to shape the game into something that could run on both the platforms without needing WiiU's asymmetric controls. Considering that BotW2 is being built ground up for the Switch, there isn't a chance of this happening, meaning delay is unlikely . So if we consider that if BotW was released in late 2016 to a hypothetically successful WiiU (coz the failure of WiiU caused it to be delayed and ported and stripped of WiiU exclusive features), it would have been a 3 year development cycle . So adding all that up, a 3 year dev cycle beginning from December 2017 with little chance of delay, we will have a late 2020 release date , meaning we will definitely see something this Game Awards and the next E3. From a show business standpoint, considering that Prime 4 has been restarted, it is unlikely that Nintendo will find any other centerpiece for E3 2020. Which all adds up. Tldr: Based on 3 year cycle of development considering delays this time are unlikely, Botw2 might release in late 2020, which will be approx 3 years after the final DLC of Breath of the wild was wrapped up. Edit: Speculation here but this article from a WiiU website waaaaay back in 2012 is pretty interesting. It is mostly vague, but not really inaccurate where its specific. [Nintendo Today Link] .
