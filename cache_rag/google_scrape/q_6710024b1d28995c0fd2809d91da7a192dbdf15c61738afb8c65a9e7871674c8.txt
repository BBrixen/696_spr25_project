As there were no general classification contenders in the breakaway group, the peloton decided to conserve energy, instead of pursuing the group. The breakaway group's lead stretched out to 15 minutes, with 40 km (25 mi) still to race. Towards the end of the final climb, Matteo Trentin attacked from the breakaway group and held on to take the stage. [ 18 ] Luke Rowe and Tony Martin were both disqualified from the Tour, following an altercation near the front of the peloton, in the latter part of the stage.

Tim Wellens led the group over the first climb, with the lead now extended to seven minutes over the peloton. Greg Van Avermaet and Julien Bernard went ahead of the lead group on the approach to the Col d'Izoard . Bernard then led alone on the climb but was caught before the summit, with Damiano Caruso leading a small group over the top. An eleven-rider group reformed at the foot of the climb to the Col du Galibier , which had a five-minute advantage over the peloton. On the Galibier, Nairo Quintana attacked with 7.5 km (4.7 mi) still to climb, leading by over a minute and a half at the summit, which he held on the descent to the finish. Meanwhile, with 2 km (1.2 mi) still to climb of the Galibier, Egan Bernal attacked from within the yellow jersey group containing Alaphilippe and Thomas, allowing Bernal to recover half a minute on the other general classification contenders by the finish.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given to Egan Bernal , who was the first rider to summit the Col de l'Iseran, the highest climb of this race. As the riders began the descent of the Col de l'Iseran, the stage was neutralised due to snow, hailstorms, and mudslides rendering the road unsafe near Val-d'Isère on the ascent to Tignes, with times for the general classification being taken at the summit of the Col de l'Iseran. [ 27 ] As a result, Bernal, who had been in second place, moved ahead of Julian Alaphilippe , who was nearly two minutes behind Bernal at the summit, and took the lead in that classification. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Due to the neutralisation, there was no official winner of the stage, and the usual stage finish time bonuses of 10, 6, and 4 seconds for the first three finishers respectively were also not awarded. However, the special time bonuses of 8, 5, and 2 seconds on offer at the summit of the Col de l'Iseran were still awarded to the first three riders respectively to reach the summit.

As a consequence, the stage was modified to avoid this part of the route, and shortened to 59 km (37 mi), keeping only the final 33 km (21 mi) climb to Val Thorens. All sporting points and time bonuses from the diverted route were withdrawn, leaving only those given on top of Val Thorens. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] As the race travelled through the valley from Albertville to Moûtiers , a group of more than twenty riders established a two and a half minute lead over the peloton. On beginning the climb to Val Thorens, the lead group was reduced to four riders, with a further two riders then joining. With 12 km (7.5 mi) until the finish, Vincenzo Nibali attacked from the lead group. Nibali then held a lead to the finish line.

The group of four's advantage held until they were caught with 10 km (6.2 mi) to the finish. The peloton then headed the race into the finish. Edvald Boasson Hagen opened the sprint in the final 500 m (550 yd), before being passed by Maximiliano Richeze and Niccolò Bonifazio.
