However, those statistics do not tell the whole story of one of the most cherished events in the world of golf. First played at Fulford in York in 1976, after morphing from the Ladies Amateur Stroke Play Championship to include professional players, the event has quickly grown to become the most international major in women's golf and one of the most prestigious. The list of AIG Women's Open Champions is a who's who of great golfers in modern times, with their victories collected on an array of well-known courses that are much loved around the world. Since 1979, the Smyth Salver has been awarded to the lowest scoring amateur player returning a score for 72 holes. Like the list of champions, the Smyth Salver has a high profile list of winners, including Michelle Wie West, Anna Nordqvist, Georgia Hall and the 2024 AIG Women's Open champion Ko.
