(Xenoblade, Xenosaga, and Xenogears.) Members Online • Mrhathead Kinda prefer Xenoblade 1’s original art style over DE Xenoblade Kinda prefer Xenoblade 1’s original art style over DE. Right away when I say original art style, I’m mostly talking about official artwork not the in-game models. Don’t get me wrong, DE’s art style is not bad by any means but I do personally feel like it’s a downgrade to the original. DE goes for a more traditional anime style more so in the vein of XB2 (though not as anime.) OG XB while still definitely anime, went for a much more realistic style which I felt helped it stand a part from a lot of other JRPGS. I honestly thought the official character artwork for OG XB was gorgeous, I loved how detailed each design was, I admit that I was a little disappointing that DE simplified a lot of the designs. OG was mainly held back by the weak hardware of the Wii that made it at times look like a PS1 era game, the models also suffered as a result. I wish we could’ve seen an HD remaster of the OG art style that featured models closer to the official artwork. Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
