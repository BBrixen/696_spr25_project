The unveiling event is scheduled for Friday, April 4, at Downes Elementary School in the Christina School District. The mascot, which draws inspiration from the eagle featured on the Newark Police Department’s uniform patch, is a unique addition to the department’s community outreach programs.

The department hopes the new character will play a key role in fostering positive relationships between Newark’s young people and its law enforcement officers. The project was made possible through a grant from the Delaware Criminal Justice Council, awarded to the Newark PAL. This funding underscores Delaware’s ongoing commitment to innovative strategies for youth engagement and community policing. Approximately 2,000 local elementary school students were involved in the naming process, submitting their ideas for what the mascot should be called. A committee of Newark Police officers and members of the Newark PAL Board of Directors selected the winning name, which will be revealed at the pep rally. The mascot’s name and the student who helped select it will be announced at the rally. Lieutenant Gregory D’Elia, the department’s Public Information Officer, emphasized the importance of the initiative, stating that the mascot represents more than just the police department – it embodies a commitment to building positive, lasting connections between officers and the community. The Newark Police Department states it’s hoping to take a step forward in its mission to enhance community bonds through innovative policing strategies. Former Indian River principal arrested on multiple charges related to falsified payments A former Sussex Central High School principal, Judith Brittingham, has been arrested on multiple charges, including Official Misconduct, Theft, and Forgery, after an investigation revealed that she falsified payments to a staff member in the Indian River School District (IRSD). On March 19, Brittingham, 46, of Lewes, turned herself in after a warrant was issued for her arrest in connection with the fraudulent overtime and mileage compensation payments she arranged for an IRSD paraprofessional. Reason for arrest According to the investigation, Brittingham facilitated the falsification of documents to benefit the paraprofessional, with whom she later began a romantic relationship. The charges stem from an investigation that uncovered more than $15,000 in unjustified overtime payments.

Brittingham submitted false paperwork claiming 159 overtime shifts, which resulted in the overpayments. The scheme was uncovered after the personnel director at Sussex Central High School alerted the district in 2024 about the romantic relationship between Brittingham and the paraprofessional. This disclosure led to an investigation, and Brittingham later admitted to the falsified payments. In addition to the fraudulent overtime, investigators also found that Brittingham had submitted falsified mileage reimbursement claims for the paraprofessional. While the paraprofessional was entitled to some reimbursement for his drive to a student’s home, the mileage claims were based on travel from his home in Laurel instead of Sussex Central High School, resulting in an overpayment of approximately $600. Authorities believe Brittingham submitted these reimbursement forms without the paraprofessional’s knowledge or consent. Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings emphasized the importance of upholding the law in public service, stating, “No one is above the law or beneath justice. Public employees who break the law are harming taxpayers, themselves, and good public servants whose work is undermined when the public trust is eroded.” Jennings expressed gratitude to the Delaware State Police and prosecutors for their efforts in the case, adding, “I am grateful to our prosecutors and the Delaware State Police for their dedication as we move forward with this case.” Brittingham faces charges of Official Misconduct, Theft, and Forgery in connection with her actions. Further developments in the case are expected as it moves through the legal process. “The Indian River School District initiated an internal investigation and notified all agencies involved when it was made aware of alleged improprieties by Dr. Brittingham,” the district said in a statement. “Additionally, we fully cooperated with the law enforcement investigation of this matter. Dr. Brittingham resigned her position in June 2024 and is no longer employed by the Indian River School District. Efforts to recoup the funds at issue are in process.” UPDATE-Police identify woman found in Christina River THIS STORY HAS BEEN UPDATED.  WILMINGTON– Police have identified the victim whose remains were discovered along Christina River earlier this month.  The woman has been identified as 32-year-old Normaris Colón Valles, who was reported missing from Philadelphia in November.

Officers responded to the 1100 block of East 7th Street on March 4 at approximately 5:59 p.m. after receiving a report of a deceased person.
