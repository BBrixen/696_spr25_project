The award was announced on The Home Depot College Football Awards show on ESPN. Walter Camp president John Barbarotta and president-elect Mike Madera were able to present Hunter the award on Wednesday in a surprise ceremony on the Boulder campus. The Walter Camp Player of Year is voted on by the nation’s 134 Football Bowl Subdivision head coaches and sports information directors. Other finalists for the 2024 Walter Camp Player of Year award included running back Ashton Jeanty (Boise State) and quarterback Cam Ward (Miami). The 58th recipient of the Walter Camp Player of Year award, Hunter is the second Colorado player to win the prestigious honor, joining the former Buffalo running back Rashaan Salaam (1994). The 2024 Big 12 Defensive Player of Year, Hunter has led 13 th -ranked Colorado to a 9-3 record and a berth in the 2024 Valero Alamo Bowl against BYU on December 28 at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. Hunter was a unanimous First Team All-Big 12 selection at defensive back. On the offensive side of the ball, Hunter was named All-Big 12 First Team as a wide receiver and was an Honorable Mention for Offensive Player of the Year. For the season, Hunter registered 31 tackles, 11 pass breakups, which tied for first in the Big 12, four interceptions (tied for second in the Big 12), 15 passes defended (first in the Big 12 and fifth in FBS), and a game-winning forced fumble on defense. Hunter’s 90.9 coverage grade ranked third among all cornerbacks in the nation. His 42.0 passer rating allowed is ninth among Power Four cornerbacks, while his four interceptions tied for fourth in that same group. Offensively, Hunter recorded 92 receptions and ranked first in the Big 12 and fifth in the NCAA, with 1,152 receiving yards which is second in the Big 12 and fifth in the country.   Hunter’s 14 receiving touchdowns led the conference and ranks second in the NCAA.  A big-play threat, Hunter had 21 receiving plays of 20 yards or more, which led FBS.  He twice had three touchdown receptions in a game, had 10 or more catches in a game three times and had 100 or more receiving yards in a game seven times. Hunter was selected as a 2024 First Team Walter Camp All-American on both offense and defense.  In the 135 years that Walter Camp has named an All-America team ( the nation’s oldest All-America team ), it is the first time a player has been named on both sides of the ball. Hunter now shares the same recognition as his head coach, Deion Sanders, who was a two-time Walter Camp All-America defensive back (at Florida State in 1987 and 1988). Walter Camp, “The Father of American football,” first selected an All-America team in 1889. Camp – a former Yale University athlete and football coach – is also credited with developing play from scrimmage, set plays, the numerical assessment of goals and tries and the restriction of play to eleven men per side. The Walter Camp Football Foundation – a New Haven-based all-volunteer group – was founded in 1967 to perpetuate the ideals of Camp and to continue the tradition of selecting annually an All-America team. The Walter Camp Football Foundation is a member of the National College Football Awards Association (NCFAA). The NCFAA was founded in 1997 as a coalition of the major collegiate football awards to protect, preserve and enhance the integrity, influence and prestige of the game’s predominant awards. The NCFAA encourages professionalism and the highest standards for the administration of its member awards and the selection of their candidates and recipients.\ About Crabtree Lexus of New Haven Crabtree Lexus of New Haven is located at 655 Main Street in East Haven, CT, convenient from anywhere in the Northeast directly off of I-95.
