Share this article Share 4.4k shares Trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the actor's on-screen career began in 1962 with roles in the films We Joined The Navy and The King's Breakfast. His career received a major boost in 1966 when he took on the leading role in Morgan: A Suitable Case For Treatment opposite Vanessa Redgrave. Career: The actor played Spicer Lovejoy in the blockbuster (pictured in the 1997 film with co-star Billy Xane) Statement: His death was confirmed by his family in a statement in which they said he had been ill for the past year and a half The film helped to establish his reputation for playing off-the-wall characters. One of his best known roles was as Keith Jennings in the classic horror film The Omen, released in 1976. David left the UK for Hollywood in 1987 and lived there for 15 years, appearing in films including Star Trek V and VI and Planet Of The Apes. More recent appearances include the 2017 romantic comedy You Me And Him and his final role as Admiral Boom in Mary Poppins Returns the following year. Illness: His death was confirmed by his family in a statement in which they said he had been ill for the past year and a half (pictured performing with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1964) Roles: David left the UK for Hollywood in 1987 and lived there for 15 years, appearing in films including Star Trek V and VI and Planet Of The Apes (pictued in Star Trek V, 1989) Success: Along with his film and TV work, David had a successful theatre career and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1963, playing the title roles in Henry VI, Richard II and Hamlet (pictured in 1984) Along with his film and TV work, David had a successful theatre career and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1963, playing the title roles in Henry VI, Richard II and Hamlet. His portrayal of the Danish prince as a student radical didn't go down well with critics but struck a nerve with younger audiences. The actor previously said: 'When I was a kid and saw Shakespeare, I never heard the actors for all the posturing and declaiming, 'I thought surely kids today were the same as I was, not wanting Shakespeare shoved down their throats. I wanted to make them come back again, of their own free will.' According to the BBC, the actor is survived by 'his beloved partner Lisa Bowerman, his much-loved son Luke and daughter-in-law Sarah, his good friend Jane Spencer Prior, his first wife Harriet Evans and his many gold dust friends.' David's family said: 'He will be missed hugely by us, his family and friends, and remembered as a kind-hearted, generous and compassionate man, partner and father, whose legacy of extraordinary work has touched the lives of so many over the years' Christmas Obituaries Share or comment on this article:                          David Warner death: Titanic star dies aged 80 following cancer-related illness e-mail 4.4k shares Most watched News videos Shocking moment tourist gets mauled by crocodile in the Philippines Beyoncé fans brawl moments after Cowboy Carter opening night show Trump declares war on Amazon as Bezos makes 'hostile' tariffs move AA crew takes down Brazilian passenger trying to barge into cockpit Moment speedboat flips going 200mph Carney has a strong message for Trump during acceptance speech Michigan Gov put on the spot by Trump during Michigan Air Base speech Stunning images capture rare albino killer whale swimming with orcas Brave man fleas for his life as polar bear charges towards him Lilibet shows off cute American accent while spending time with Meghan Man ziplines as gun shots sound and people flee beneath him Flight attendant gets hilarious shock when she sees her room's 'view' Bing Site Web Enter search term: Search DON'T MISS EXCLUSIVE Revealed: Bill Belichick's icy response to friends staging dramatic Jordon Hudson intervention Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds put on a brave face as they step out amid ANOTHER Justin Baldoni bombshell EXCLUSIVE Leonardo DiCaprio debuts sudden weight loss in Ibiza, as insiders spill on sensual reaction of girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti, 26 Harrowing new detail in Gene Hackman wife's autopsy revealed after she was killed by rat-borne virus EXCLUSIVE Melania Trump's confidants tell all about sudden shift in marriage to 'unsteady' Donald The chocolate industry's dirty secret: The truth behind the world's most famous food Sponsored Jennifer Garner appears to make thinly-veiled dig at Blake Lively in resurfaced clip Sign up for a Visible+ Pro wireless plan and get unlimited talk, text, and data - plus an iPhone 14 Plus for only $199 SHOPPING EXCLUSIVE Famous New York restaurateur reveals he had five-year romance with celebrated British playwright Alan Bennett Fans call Hailey Bieber a 'creepy stalker' after 'copying' Selena Gomez in acceptance speech nearly word for word Dallas star dead at 100: Hollywood actress who was Steven Spielberg's mother-in-law passes away Top notch travel ideas for every style and budget Sponsored Taylor Swift's epic dig at Kanye West revealed by Ed Sheeran REVEALED: The supplement so effective reviewers say they 'look five years younger' - meet the NAD+ formula taking over Amazon SHOPPING EXCLUSIVE Inside Heather Locklear's stunning secret hilltop retreat: How it brought her back from the brink after meltdown sparked fears for her life Alec Baldwin REPLACED by A-list star on Match Game amid his disastrous reality TV show Kim Kardashian goes makeup free for pricey skin treatment regimen as she prepares for 2025 Met Gala Hit the open road!
