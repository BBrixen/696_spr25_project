Three movies tied for the second-most noms with 10: Netflix’s Martin Scorsese mobster pic The Irishman , Sam Mendes’ World War I epic 1917 and Quentin Tarantino’s personal ode to 1969 Tinseltown Once Upon a Time in Hollywood . The Academy revealed noms in 24 categories this morning capped by the marquee Best Picture race, which featured nine titles. In addition to the above, the list includes Fox’s racing drama Ford V Ferrari along with Taika Waititi’s Jojo Rabbit , Sony’s Greta Gerwig-directed Little Women , Netflix’s Marriage Story and Bong Joon-Ho’s Parasite . The latter four grabbed six noms apiece.

Two distributors had 12 apiece: Warner Bros and Fox Searchlight. Watch on Deadline The actor and actress fields mostly kept consistent with the trends this awards season — Phoenix and Renee Zellweger (for Judy ) have emerged as frontrunners, as have Brad Pitt for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Laura Dern for Marriage Story in the Supporting races. All made the cut this morning. Oscar Nominations 2020: Deadline’s Complete Coverage Among double nominees, Scarlett Johansson scored twice with Lead Actress (for Marriage Story ) and Supporting Actress ( Jojo Rabbit ). Todd Phillips ( Joker ), Quentin Tarantino ( Once Upon a Time in Hollywood ) and Bong Joon-Ho ( Parasite ) are nominated in both Directing and screenplay categories. Other two-nommers include producer David Heyman with two Best Picture noms for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Marriage Story , and producer Emma Tillinger Koskoff, who is only the second woman (after Megan Ellison) to have two Best Picture noms in the same year with Joker and The Irishman. And Cynthia Enivo scored Best Actress and a Best Song noms for Harriet. The Academy said a record 62 women were nominated this year — almost a third of all nominees. But Greta Gerwig might have been the most notable omission of the day, not making the Director list (though she did get an Adapted Screenplay nom). Only five women in the history of the Oscars have been nominated for Best Director. Diversity among the candidates also remains an issue. Following a similar pattern set by the BAFTA Awards and the Golden Globes, only two actors of color were nominated in the major categories. Little Women was among four films to score six noms, along with Marriage Story , Jojo Rabbit and Parasite . The latter South Korean film as expected crossed over from the International Feature race with noms for Picture, Director, Original Screenplay, Editing and Production Design. Other craft staples this morning included 1917 , the last big awards pic to hit theaters this season. It hit in Production Design, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing and Visual Effects. Making the VFX list are two mega-tentpoles: Avengers: Endgame and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker . The final Star Wars installment of the Skywalker Saga scored composer John Williams his 52nd Oscar nomination, breaking his own mark for the most noms ever by one person. With today’s announcement completed, final Academy voting begins January 30 and wraps at 5 PM PT on February 4. Winners to be unveiled February 9 at the 92nd Academy Awards live on ABC from the Dolby Theater at Hollywood & Highland.
