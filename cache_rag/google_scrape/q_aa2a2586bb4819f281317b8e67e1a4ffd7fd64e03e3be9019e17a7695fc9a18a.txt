Been listening to the pod and YouTube channel for years now and every so often the Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody comes up. I don't know if it's just a bit but James seems to REALLY not like it. Has he ever explained why? I'll admit I'm usually working while listening so I occasionally miss moments here and there, but the level of hatred just seems so random. I'm pretty sure Rami won an Oscar that year for it, and the Live Aid scenes alone are awesome. Edit: let me clarify, I guess my main point of confusion is that I would consider this "just a movie" to use a term from the show. It's not the best movie ever, but it's fine. The acting is fine, the story makes sense, you can follow what's going on etc. There's been tons of movies they've reviewed that are functionally much worse, yet those don't seem to have the same level of intense hatred from James, whose usually pretty unbothered, which is why it felt so out of place. I watch a lot of historical movies so I guess I'm just used to them cutting things for time or for the sake of the story. Rarely do you find a movie that spans years and years that fully tells every detail of something without leaving out or combining anything. Read more New to Reddit?
