Galan , Aug 6, 2024 This graph illustrates the breakdown of votes casted in the first round of the presidential elections in France on 24 April 2017, by candidate. In total, Emmanuel Macron led the polls, with 23.9 percent of the votes casted in favor of him. Not far behind him, the candidate of the Front National party obtained 21.4 percent. Marine Le Pen qualified alongside Emmanuel Macron for the second round of the presidential election that was held on Sunday, May 7.
