The spotlight should only intensify as the men's and women's singles tournaments draw to a close, with tennis pillars like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal up against each other in the semifinals. The two famously also met in the semifinals of the 2019 French Open, where Nadal continued his clay-court dominance, although Federer is also riding momentum of a historic Wimbledon feat this year -- becoming the first player ever to reach 350 Grand Slam singles wins. Serena Williams is among the final contenders for the women, and she is set to square off with No. 7 Simona Halep in her 11th career Wimbledon final after topping Barbora Strycova. As the remainder of the Wimbledon Championships unfold, keep it locked right here at CBSSports.com for notable results across both men's and women's singles, as well as prominent upcoming matches on the schedule: Notable men's singles results Semifinals No. 2 Roger Federer defeats No. 3 Rafael Nadal 7-6, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 No. 1 Novak Djokovic defeats No. 23 Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 Quarterfinals No. 1 Novak Djokovic defeats No. 21 David Goffin 6-4, 6-0, 6-2 No. 23 Roberto Bautista Agut defeats No. 26 Guido Pella 7-5, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 No. 2 Roger Federer defeats No. 8 Kei Nishikori 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 No. 3 Rafael Nadal defeats Sam Querrey 7-5, 6-2, 6-2 Fourth round No. 2 Roger Federer defeats No. 17 Matteo Berrettini 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 No. 23 Roberto Bautista Agut defeats No. 28 Benoit Paire 6-3, 7-5, 6-2 Third round No. 26 Guido Pella defeats No. 4 Kevin Anderson 6-4, 6-3, 7-6(4) No. 23 Roberto Bautista Agut defeats No. 10 Kharen Khachanov 6-3, 7-6(3), 6-1 No. 21 David Goffin defeats No. 11 Daniil Medvedev 4-6, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 No. 2 Roger Federer defeats No. 27 Lucas Pouille 7-5, 6-2, 7-6(4) No. 17 Matteo Berrettini defeats No. 24 Diego Schwartzman 6-7(5), 7-6(2), 4-6, 7-6(5), 6-3 Second round Fernando Verdasco defeats No. 31 Kyle Edmund 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 6-3, 6-4 Reilly Opelka defeats No. 22 Stan Wawrinka 7-5, 3-6, 4-6, 6-4, 8-6 No. 11 Daniil Medvedev defeats Alexei Popyrin 6-7, 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 First round Jiri Vesely defeats No. 6 Alexander Zverev 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 7-5 Thomas Fabbiano defeats No. 7 Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-7, 6-3 Notable women's singles results Semifinals No. 7 Simona Halep defeats No. 8 Elina Svitolina 6-1, 6-3 No. 11 Serena Williams defeats Barbora Strycova 6-1, 6-2 Quarterfinals No. 11 Serena Williams defeats Alison Riske 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 Barbora Strycova defeats No. 19 Johanna Konta 7-6, 6-1 No. 7 Simona Halep defeats Zhang Shuai 7-6, 6-1 Fourth round No. 19 Johanna Konta defeats No. 6 Petra Kvitova 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 No. 7 Simona Halep defeats Cori Gauff 6-3, 6-2 No. 11 Serena Williams defeats No. 30 Carla Suarez Navarro 6-2, 6-2 Alison Riske defeats No. 1 Ashleigh Barty 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 Third round No. 3 Karolina Pliskova defeats No. 28 Hsieh Su-wei 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 No. 8 Elina Svitolina defeats No. 31 Maria Sakkari 6-3, 6-7(1), 6-2 No. 11 Serena Williams defeats No. 18 Julia Görges 6-3, 6-4 No. 19 Johanna Konta defeats No. 9 Sloane Stephens 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 Second round Danielle Rose Collins defeats No. 12 Anastasija Sevastova 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 Polona Hercog defeats No. 17 Madison Keys 6-2, 6-4 Dayana Yastremska defeats No. 27 Sofia Kenin 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 No. 3 Karolina Pliskova defeats Monica Puig 6-0, 6-4 First round Cori Gauff defeats Venus Williams 6-4, 6-4 Yulia Putintseva defeats No. 2 Naomi Osaka 7-6, 6-2 Magdalena Rybarikova defeats No. 10 Aryna Sabalenka 6-2, 6-4 Our Latest Tennis Stories Rafael Nadal, now retired, says he does not miss tennis Isabel Gonzalez                                                                 • 1 min read Dart apologizes after asking opponent to wear deodorant Chris Bengel                                                                 • 1 min read Billie Jean King makes history with Walk of Fame star Austin Nivison                                                                 • 1 min read Swiatek harassed by unruly fan at Miami Open Steven Taranto                                                                 • 1 min read PTPA sues ATP, WTA: 'Tennis is broken' Austin Nivison                                                                 • 2 min read Raducanu 'distraught' by encountering stalker in Dubai Steven Taranto                                                                 • 1 min read Now Playing Share Share Video Link copied! 2019 Wimbledon Championships results Cody Benjamin 2 min read Rafael Nadal, now retired, says he does not miss tennis Isabel Gonzalez 1 min read Dart apologizes after asking opponent to wear deodorant Chris Bengel 1 min read Billie Jean King makes history with Walk of Fame star Austin Nivison 1 min read Swiatek harassed by unruly fan at Miami Open Steven Taranto 1 min read PTPA sues ATP, WTA: 'Tennis is broken' Austin Nivison 2 min read Raducanu 'distraught' by encountering stalker in Dubai Steven Taranto 1 min read Male fan ejected after behavior frightens Raducanu Steven Taranto 1 min read Djokovic cries 'favoritism' in Sinner doping case Isabel Gonzalez 4 min read Sinner accepts three-month ban for doping violation Brandon Wise 1 min read More Pick'em Games Fantasy Sports Free Sports TV Betting Analysis March Madness Mobile Apps Company About Us Careers About Paramount Paramount+ CBS TV Regulation Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices Closed Captioning California Notice Cookie Policy Contact Us Help Customer Care Social Media YouTube TikTok Instagram Facebook X Threads Flipboard Account Manage My Account Newsletters My Teams Wallet Forgot Password © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.
