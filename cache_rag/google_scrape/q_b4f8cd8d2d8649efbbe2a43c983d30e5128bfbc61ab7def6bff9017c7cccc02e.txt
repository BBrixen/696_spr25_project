Post-Apocalypse [ ] Virginia [ ] Adrienne survived the early stages of the outbreak and eventually found herself as a member of a large group of survivors led by a woman named Natania . Unfortunately, her group would be discovered by a large, hostile organization of survivors led by Simon (who later became Negan 's ruthless and sadistic second-in-command) and under his orders, Adrienne and her people were forced to gather and provide supplies for them under threat of death. Eventually, under Natania's orders, the group initiated a rebellion to fight back against their oppressors. However, due to being outgunned and outnumbered, their group was defeated. As punishment for their defiance and to deter any further resistance, Simon had his group murder every male survivor above the age of 10 in Adrienne's group. It is unknown if any of Adrienne's family were among the casualties of the rebellion or subsequent massacre. Following this and being unwilling to continue working for Simon and his group, Adrienne and her group, consisting mainly of females now, fled their community and established a new home at a location called Oceanside and reestablished their community hidden from them. In order to prevent Simon and his group from finding them again, Natania ordered any survivor who happened upon the community to be immediately killed in order to maintain the secrecy of their new home.

"Let the fair of a new beginning begin!" Ezekiel says as everyone celebrates and applauds. Adrienne then enjoys the fair and socializes with the people of the Coalition. That night, Adrienne attends the theater and watches the movie with other fair attendees. The next day, Adrienne listens from the crowd as Siddiq delivers the tragic news about the fate of the missing fair attendees, tells them how brave the victims were in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story.
