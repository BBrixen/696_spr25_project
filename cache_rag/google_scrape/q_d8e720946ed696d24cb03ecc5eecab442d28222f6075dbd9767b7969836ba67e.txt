It serves as a mid-range variant within the Pixel 9 series. The device has similar features and functionality with the rest of the Pixel 9 family, with the main focus on its improved durability, photography features, long battery life, AI-powered tools, and Gemini assistant integration. It is the first A-series Pixel phone to have an IP68 dust and water resistance rating, and has the largest battery of a Pixel handset, at 5100 mAh . [ 3 ] It is priced $499, the same as its predecessor. [ 4 ] History [ edit ] The Pixel 9a was announced on March 19, 2025, through a Google blog post. [ 5 ] It follows the same shift in the sequential rollout as the rest of the Pixel 9 series by releasing around two months earlier compared to the previous generations. Typically, previous A-series Pixels would be announced in May, around or during the Google I/O Event around the same time. On the same day the Pixel 9a was announced, Google spotted a potential "component quality issue" with a few number of the devices, and cancelled pre-orders and delayed the phone's launch until April 2025. [ 6 ] It was originally slated to be released on March 26, 2025. [ 7 ] A new release date of April 10th was later announced, after the issue was resolved. [ 8 ] Design [ edit ] The design of the Pixel 9a shares similarities with the rest of the Pixel 9 family, the notable exception being the rear cameras with smaller sensors are now nearly flush with the body, as opposed to a camera cutout found on the other models in the family. Compared to its predecessor the Pixel 8a , the body of the device has been squared up with flat rails and rounded edges, matching the rest of the Pixel 9 series. It is also the first Pixel phone since the Pixel 5a to not feature the customary visor or cutout that spans horizontally across the back, top-half of the device, which houses rear cameras and other sensors. The Pixel 9a comes in four colors, Iris, Peony, Porcelain, and Obsidian: Color options for the Pixel 9a series Pixel 9a Iris Peony Porcelain Obsidian References [ edit ] ^ "Google Pixel 9a - Tech Specs" .
