They are currently in the very new " privilaged dialogue" stage of the bidding process that practically grooms ideal sites to host the next games (the doing of Karl Stoss). From what I'm aware, this is only for the Winter Games , but I could be wrong on that. ****************************************************************************************************************** Now, to the 2036 and 2040 Summer Games ... The current confirmed bids for 2036 are as follows: Nusantra, Indonesia (steakholder) Istanbul, Turkey (steakholder) Ahmedaba/Delhi, India and Santiago, Chile Of the four, I can confidently say India will not be hosting . While India has the support of the French President Macron, the Indian OC is not publicly supporting the bid themselves . Without them, hosting any games is all but impossible. Another farfetched host site for 2036 in my eyes comes from a current steakholder: Indonesia . Australia will be hosting the 2032 Summer Games , so it doesn't make sense for two consecutive summer olympics to be in the same region. That hasn't happened since the 1948 and 1952 in London and Helsinki [Europe. Yes very technical] ( 84 years ). Between Turkey and Chile, I'd say Turkey has the best shot of host . While both are slated to host a variety of world games , an "Istanbul 2036" Summer Games would technically be the first Olympics Games hosted in the middle-east region . Since Qatar and Saudi Arabia have entered the international sporting world through FIFA, FIBA, and other bids for world games, this is a very strong bid. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ There are some other prospective bids that can be confirmed between now and LA 2028 (when the site should be selected by) . Of the list of 9, there are 4 that could come from behind and take the bid from Turkey : Cape Town/Johannesburg, South Africa Seoul/North Jeolla Province, South Korea Doha, Qatar and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Two of the four will definetly raise questions: Qatar and Saudi Arabia . I chalked those up to the "Coca-Cola Paradox" in reference to the 1996 Summer Games being hosted in Atlanta instead of Athens (you can google that one yourself). If you are a fan of FIFA, then you might know it as the "2022 World Cup Paradox." Hopefully that explains enough. They do have similar arguments to Istanbul for hosting the games , but I believe that Instanbul will have more favorable weather for spectators and athletes and they already have the required infrastructure either available or planned for construction that Qatar and Saudi Arabia haven't planned yet. From this list, it would be hard to argue against South Africa . They are already set to officially bid in Febuary and their development since the days of Apartaid has been rapid and powerful . There is also the obvious storyline of a "Capetown 2036" or "Johannesburg 2036" Summer Games being the first Olympic Games hosted in Africa . But they'll have to play catchup to Turkey since they are already steakholders. If it wasn't for the storylines of South Africa and Turkey, South Korea would have had an amazing shot of hosting. Seoul/North Jeolla Province 1988 would be almost 48 years old before 2036 and Asia last hosted in 2020, 16 years before 2036. They would be in a prime position to host after Summer 2040 . ****************************************************************************************************************** Speaking of Summer 2040 , here's the list of prospective bids : New Administrative Captial, Egypt (please get a new name by then) London, England Munich, Germany and Warsaw, Poland I'll start with Poland . I don't think they will end up bidding for this games . They are prepared to also bid for a future games and I believe they will go that route. Especially with other more wealthier countries looking to host. London also will miss out on the 2040 bid. While the mayor is looking to host , they still need government and British OA support. Without that, they'll run into the same issue as India for 2036 . Egypt is a very interesting posibility . They would be the first country in africa to host an olympic games (assuming South Africa doesn't host) . But most of their bid talks have been about Egypt showing out in 2024 with more success. But they doesn't have the proper infrastructure available as of right now and I question the heat during the summer. If they have solutions for both then they'll have a strong bid. Now we are at Germany . Germany will be celebrating 50 years of reunification and hasn't hosted a summer olympics since before reunification (I won't mention the last time they hosted when unified) . They also have the ability to build the needed infrastructure with sustainability in mind. ****************************************************************************************************************** Now the moment you all have been waiting for... My list for the 2036-2042 Summer and Winter Olympics are... Istanbul 2036 Summer Olympics (*Johannesburg 2036 as runner-up) Switzerland 2038 Winter Olympics Munich 2040 Summer Olympics (Egypt 2036 as runner-up) and Sapporo 2042 Winter Olympics *I personally think they should host, but believe the IOC will go a different direction with how the Middle East's increased involvement in world sporting events. I also believe that Seoul 2044 Summer Olympics could be what the IOC is trying to line up, especially with the Sapporo 2038 Winter Games all but set via. the "privilaged dialogue". If North and South Korea are able to reunify by then, then it could turn into a Pyongyang 2044 Summer Olympics or Pyongyang 2046 Winter Olympics with an Johannesburg or Istanbul 2044 Summer Olympics (depending on 2036 bid winner). But this is all speculation as of now. I also may have written off some bids for any of these games (mostly summer) without seeing something crucial , please let me know if I did and I'll reevaluate the list.
