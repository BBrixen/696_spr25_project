Members Online • secretchuu Why can’t Diablo 4 be played offline? General Question The answer is probably obvious to a lot of you, but I don’t know about these things. Every single other game I’ve played for the last 30 years, I can play offline. I played Diablo 3 without ever seeing another player running around. I looked this up and only got results stating that it can only be played online with no explanation why.  Just want to know what their reasoning is for not allowing people to play offline. On a personal note, it annoys the hell out of me that I am forced to play online. I see other people running around and it ruins the immersion for me. There’s like 10 people standing in front my my chest. I’m like get the fuck out of my room. Now I can’t play this single player game at all because servers are down. So I’m just shitty about it. Maybe I’m the odd one here and most people like that’s it’s permanently online. I don’t know, but this sucks. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.
