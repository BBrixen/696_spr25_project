The 23-day event, won by Geraint Thomas in 2018, features 21 total daylong stages and some of the best cyclists from around the globe. The first two stages of this year's Tour went to the Netherlands, with Mike Teuinessen taking the opening flat stage and his team, Jumbo-Visma, winning the team time trial from the Royal Palace of Brussels to the Atomium. Belgium, meanwhile, claimed three stages in the 6-10 run, with Wout van Aert taking Stage 10 on July 15. Simon Yates, brother of 2016 fourth-place finisher Adam Yates, took Stage 12 on the mountain and roared back to win Stage 15 as well, with Italy claiming its second stage three days later.
