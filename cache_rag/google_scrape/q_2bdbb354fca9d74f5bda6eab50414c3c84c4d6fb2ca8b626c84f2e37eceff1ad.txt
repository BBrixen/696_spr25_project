Members Online • bluesydragon Question about difference in Assassin creed games on consoles vs Stadia and which Games to go with as a noob while the sale on? :) Question Hello so i've literally never played any assassin creed game, apart from online multiplayer black flag once and i found it fun but ive been itching to buy and play on stadia if worth it Q1) so first off I heard some certain games have been improved specifically for the stadia release? is that true or is it for PC in general/other consoles (ps4 etc)? Just will help decision making if its the same game no improvement (fps/graphics) then may be ill grab it for ps3/4. Q2) Also..not sure which games to get before sale ends I have Valhalla but yet to play it, I have 26.39 CAD to spend, but also realized i can signup my family members and use 10 off on each of their accounts, to also maybe get 2+ copies of Unity to coop? the games are: Black Flag - 11.99 Black Flag Gold Edition - 19.49 Black Flag season pass - 7.49 Origins - 19.99 Origins Deluxe - 23.49 Origins Gold - too high dont wanna go over Origins Season Pass - 21.59 Rogue Remastered - 13.19 Syndicate - 11.99 Syndicate season pass - 11.99 Syndicate Gold Edition - 20.09 Unity - 11.99 Q4) So im not sure if expansions are worth it off the get go or add later? But im leaning towards Black Flag (base of gold?) and maybe 2+ copies of Unity so i can multiplayer with siblings? If its worth it? Q5) Or any other stadia game you recommend? maybe something improved upon for stadia that falls within budget? Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
