Click here to view the full breakdown. Top Rankings and Milestones A new year-end No.1 is crowned Aryna Sabalenka became the 16th year-end No.1 in rankings history after winning two major titles in a season for the first time -- the Australian Open and US Open. Sabalenka first rose to World No.1 in September 2023 but was edged out by Iga Swiatek for the year-end status in the final week of that season. This time, with various scenarios at play, Sabalenka maintained her lead at the WTA Finals in Riyadh, resulting in a year-end swap between her and Swiatek in the No.1 and No.2 positions. This marks the third time in the history of the rankings the year-end No.1 and No.2 have changed places in consecutive years, following Stefanie Graf and Monica Seles (1990-91), and Lindsay Davenport and Martina Hingis (1998-99).

Barbora Krejcikova (+0 from No.10) Titles: 1 (Wimbledon) Finalist: 0 Win-loss record: 21-16 Top 10 quick hits Sabalenka's five consecutive year-end Top 10 finishes (dating back to 2020) comprise the longest active such streak in the current Top 10. She's followed by Swiatek (four straight years since 2021), Gauff (three straight years since 2022) and Pegula (three straight years since 2022). This year also marks a third non-consecutive Top 10 finish for both Kasatkina and Krejcikova. Gauff, 20, is the youngest player in the year-end Top 10. Pegula, 30, is the oldest. Three players made their Top 10 debuts in 2024, compared to four in 2023: Zheng Qinwen (Jan. 29), Jasmine Paolini (June 10) and Emma Navarro (Sep. 9). Zheng became the second Chinese player to reach the Top 10 (and subsequently Top 5) following two-time major champion Li Na, who peaked at No.2 in 2014. Paolini became the fifth Italian player ever to reach the Top 10, and third to reach the Top 5. Her year-end position matches the all-time career high by an Italian woman of No.4, first set by Francesca Schiavone in 2011. Gauff (No.3) and Krejcikova (No.10) are the only players in the Top 100 whose 2024 year-end ranking is the same as their 2023 year-end ranking. Gauff did not go higher than No.2 or lower than No.6 during the year; Krejcikova did not go higher than No.8 but was as low as No.32 in June.

This year marks her fourth finish at the summit, tying her with Cara Black and Liezel Huber. Only five-time year-end No.1 Martina Navratilova has ended more seasons in the top spot. But this year was still a new chapter for Siniakova. In her previous No.1 seasons, she played predominantly with fellow Czech Barbora Krejcikova, with whom she won her first seven Grand Slam titles. They ended their regular partnership at the end of 2023, which Siniakova ended at No.10. In 2024, Siniakova won her first two majors with different partners -- Coco Gauff at Roland Garros and Taylor Townsend at Wimbledon. The year-end doubles Top 10 is rounded out by No.2 Erin Routliffe, No.3 Gabriela Dabrowski, No.4 Lyudmyla Kichenok, No.5 Taylor Townsend, No.6 Jelena Ostapenko, No.7 Hsieh Su-Wei, No.8 Sara Errani, No.9 Elise Mertens and No.10 Jasmine Paolini. Errani, who spent 87 weeks at World No.1 between 2012 and 2015, makes the biggest jump into the year-end Top 10 -- up 117 places from No.125 in the 2023 year-end rankings.
