My Nintendo Career Sitemap Welcome to Nintendo Support Get support for your Nintendo systems, software and services Is there a Difference Between the Expansion Pass and the standalone version of Torna - The Golden Country? (Xenoblade Chronicles 2) The content included in the Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Expansion Pass is the same content that is included in Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna - The Golden Country. Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna - The Golden Country includes the same story that is included in the Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Expansion Pass, and a download code for packs 1-4 of the Expansion Pass DLC (playable in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 only). Ways to Purchase: There are two ways to get the full content: Xenoblade Chronicles 2 + Expansion Pass (includes DLC Packs 1-4 and the Torna story), OR Xenoblade Chronicles 2 + Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna - The Golden Country (includes a download code for DLC Packs 1-4, playable in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 only) Because the content in the Expansion Pass is the same content included in Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna - The Golden Country, there is no reason to purchase both items.
