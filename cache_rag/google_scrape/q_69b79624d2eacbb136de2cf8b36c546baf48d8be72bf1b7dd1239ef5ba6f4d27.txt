Jamie Robert Murray (born 13 February 1986) is a British professional tennis player who specialises in doubles. He is a seven-time major doubles champion (five in mixed doubles and two in men's doubles), a Davis Cup winner, and a former doubles World No. 1 . He has won seven Grand Slam tournament titles: in mixed doubles at the 2007 Wimbledon Championships , with Jelena Janković , the 2017 Wimbledon Championships and 2017 US Open , with Martina Hingis , and the 2018 and 2019 US Open , with Bethanie Mattek-Sands , and in men's doubles at the Australian Open and US Open in 2016, with Bruno Soares . Murray had an early career partnership with Eric Butorac , winning three titles in 2007. His following seven ATP finals came with six different partners. In 2013, he began a new partnership with John Peers , winning six ATP tournaments, and reaching two Grand Slam finals. After this partnership ended, Murray played alongside Soares from 2016, with the new pair enjoying almost immediate success after winning only their second ATP tournament together. [ 2 ] They went on to win the 2016 Australian Open and US Open , and Murray became world no. 1 in April that year, spending nine weeks at the top of the rankings. He and Soares split in 2019, with Murray competing alongside compatriot Neal Skupski until the end of 2020, winning one ATP title together. [ 3 ] He then reunited with Soares, with the pair finishing runners-up at the 2021 US Open . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Murray was part of the Great Britain team that won the 2015 Davis Cup , the nation's first victory in the tournament for 79 years. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] He and his brother recorded crucial doubles victories in Britain's quarterfinal, semifinal and final wins. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The Davis Cup team was awarded the 2015 BBC Sports Personality Team of the Year Award . [ 10 ] Murray has also competed at the Summer Olympics on four occasions. Brad Gilbert , who coached Andy Murray , gave Jamie the name 'Stretch' because of his 6-foot-3-inch height and long arms. [ 11 ] Early and personal life [ edit ] Jamie Murray was born in Glasgow , Scotland, [ 12 ] the elder son of Judith (née Erskine) and William Murray. He grew up in Dunblane and attended Dunblane Primary School . Jamie is the elder brother of fellow tennis player and former singles world No. 1, Andy Murray . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] He and his brother were present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre , [ 15 ] [ 16 ] when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before shooting himself. Both brothers were part of a group of pupils who took cover in a classroom. [ 15 ] His parents separated in 1998, with the boys living with their father while being mentored in tennis by their mother. [ 17 ] At the age of 10, Jamie was No 3-ranked tennis player of his age in Europe. [ 18 ] At 11 years and 5 months, he finished runner-up in the boys under 12 category at the prestigious Junior Orange Bowl . [ 19 ] Murray was the junior world number 2 when he was 13 years old [ 20 ] and was selected to be educated at The Leys School in Cambridge with four other boys whilst being trained by national coaches. But being the youngest meant that instead of Leys, he went to St Faith's School [ 21 ] down the road, which was a feeder school. He was isolated from the other players and the coaching wasn't to his liking, so after eight months he returned home. He has not criticised the coach in charge, and stated that blaming the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) would be an easy option. [ 22 ] Back home, he did not touch a tennis racquet for two years. [ 18 ] In 2004, he partnered his brother to the semifinal of the Junior US Open . [ 23 ] Jamie and Andy call each other 'Tight' as a nickname.

With this positive result, the duo went on to the Wimbledon Championships . However, they went out in the third round after losing against Czech duo of Lukáš Dlouhý and Pavel Vízner . Nevertheless, Murray was successful in the mixed doubles partnering with Jelena Janković . Murray had met Janković at a party in Miami in 2006, where she was unaware that he played tennis. Murray's agent subsequently asked her if she would like to play mixed doubles with him at Wimbledon. She had made no decision until they arrived at the All England Club. At the same time, the day before the tournament started and Murray asked again, when she agreed. [ 52 ] They won the Mixed Doubles title at Wimbledon , Murray becoming the first Briton to win a Wimbledon title for 20 years. Great Britain's last Wimbledon winners were Jeremy Bates and Jo Durie in 1987, also in the Mixed Doubles. In July 2007, Murray and Butorac started the hard court season at the Countrywide Classic , where they lost in the first round, then played in the Indianapolis Tennis Championships , losing in the quarterfinals, and in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic , where they were out in the first round. In August, Murray continued his preparation for the US Open. First, he played the Canadian Open in Montreal partnering with American James Blake (losing in the first round), then took part in the Cincinnati Masters with Indian Mahesh Bhupathi (where they lost in the second round), and lastly he played the New Haven Open with Australian Jordan Kerr (losing in the semifinals). Since Memphis tournament in February, Murray and Butorac only went past the quarterfinals of a tournament once.

In September 2007, Murray was selected for the Davis Cup World Group Play-off against Croatia. Murray played the doubles with Tim Henman beating Marin Čilić and Lovro Zovko .

Murray participated in the Paris Masters , his last tournament of the season, with his brother Andy. The brothers lost in the first round against Kerr and André Sá . Murray lost his singles ranking this year. [ 55 ] Murray began 2008 with his new doubles partner Max Mirnyi , but the partnership struggled. Despite victory in the Delray Beach International Tennis Championships in February, they had failed to reach any other finals, winning just one of their first four matches as a pair and exiting eleven tournaments within the first two rounds, including at the 2008 Australian Open . Without Mirnyi, Murray has appeared to have had more success, reaching the semi-final of the Movistar Open with Nicolás Lapentti in January and final of the Estoril Open with Kevin Ullyett in April. Murray still showed some interest in singles tennis. He competed in a singles qualifying match against Marcel Granollers in January and applied for a wildcard singles entry for Wimbledon . He was given a wildcard into the qualifying stages for the Queen's Club Championships, but lost to Poland's Łukasz Kubot and was refused entry into the Wimbledon singles tournament. Whilst Murray enjoyed singles, he also thought the Davis Cup team would stand in good stead to have another member with recent singles experience, but he now accepted that he would henceforth only be a doubles player. [ 55 ] With Mirnyi, he reached the final and semi-final of the Slazenger Open and Artois Championships respectively, but failed to progress beyond the third round of Wimbledon. Murray at the 2008 Pilot Pen Tennis tournament Murray had a public fall out with brother Andy Murray , criticising him for dropping out of the World Group first round tie against Argentina over fears he could aggravate a knee injury. Jamie played in and lost the doubles match with Ross Hutchins . Great Britain eventually lost 4–1. This was Great Britain's first World Group match since 2003, now facing a relegation play-off with Austria. The Murrays would not speak to each other for two weeks. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] At the Olympic Games , the two Murrays competed together in the doubles tournament. [ 58 ] After defeating Canadian pair Frédéric Niemeyer and Daniel Nestor in the first Round, they then lost to the French pair, Arnaud Clément and Michaël Llodra , in straight sets. [ 59 ] The Davis Cup captain John Lloyd said he watched the Murrays doubles at the Olympics, and it was clear they were not getting on. [ citation needed ] Mixed doubles once again proved to be more successful for Murray in 2008. Competing with Liezel Huber , he reached the final of the 2008 US Open , though they lost to Cara Black and Leander Paes . He also reached the semi-finals of Wimbledon and quarter-finals of Roland Garros. Seven months after the Davis Cup Argentina match, the Murray brothers prepared for the tie against Austria, with Andy declaring that he had healed the rift with Jamie. [ 60 ] Andy won his singles matches, but Jamie and Ross Hutchins lost the doubles. Great Britain eventually lost their World Group play-off to Austria 3-2 and were relegated to Europe/Africa Zone Group 1. Mirnyi and Murray had mediocre results, compiling a 15–17 record. They split in September 2008, [ 61 ] and Murray formed a new partnership with Dušan Vemić of Serbia at the start of the 2009 season. [ 62 ] In November 2008, Murray finished the season partnering Jamie Delgado. They played in the Slovak Open (where they were defeated in the quarterfinals), the PEOPLEnet Cup (where they lost in the first round) and the IPP Open (where they were defeated in the first round). In 2009, Murray played the Brisbane and Sydney tournaments with Vemić but played the Australian Open with his old partner Eric Butorac as Vemić was unavailable. Butorac and Murray, who had not played together since the 2007 US Open, lost in the first round at Melbourne Park. [ 63 ] Since splitting from Vemić at the end of February, Murray played with several different partners, including Simon Aspelin , Jamie Delgado (playing together the Status Athens Open ), Paul Hanley (playing together the Zagorka Cup and the Tunis Open ), Pavel Vízner (playing together the Zagreb Open , Gilles Müller and Jonathan Erlich . [ 64 ] With Müller he reached the semi-final at Nottingham , his best result since the same tournament last year. [ 65 ] Murray played with Vízner at the French Open and with Erlich at Wimbledon, but was defeated in the first round of both tournaments. [ 66 ] However, he did reach the semifinals of the mixed doubles at Wimbledon with his regular partner Liezel Huber . [ 67 ] Dropping out of the world top one hundred, Murray returned to the Challenger circuit with new partner Jamie Delgado playing in the Poznań Open . The British duo returned to the ATP Tour to play the Umag Open , where they were defeated in the first round. This was the last top level tournament Murray played in the season. Once he started playing in the lower ranked tournaments, he took part in the San Marino Open and the Zucchetti Kos Tennis Cup . However, he only won his first tournament of any sort in eighteen months at the Tirani Cup in August 2009. He then participated in the Savoldi–Cò – Trofeo Dimmidisì followed by victory at the TEAN International (with Jonathan Marray ).

[ 69 ] Playing in his first tournament since getting married, Murray played with his brother Andy Murray . The pair had a great week in Valencia and won the tournament. This was Jamie's first win on the top level of the tour for over two years and the first time that he has won a doubles title with his brother. [ 70 ] [ 71 ] Murray ended the season with another Challenger win, in Bratislava . Jamie with his brother Andy at the 2011 Japan Open Tennis Championships Murray began 2011 playing with Xavier Malisse . Though the pair lost in their first ATP event at Chennai, Murray won his first match at a Grand Slam since Wimbledon 2008 as they progressed to the second round of the Australian Open . Murray followed this up with two semi-final appearances, partnering Alexander Peya at the SA Open and his brother Andy at Rotterdam . These successes saw Murray climb back into the world top 50. At the French Open , Murray and his partner Chris Guccione were eliminated in the second round of the men's doubles by the top-seeded Bryans , but he progressed to the semi-finals of the mixed doubles with Nadia Petrova . In August, he reached the semi-finals of the Winston–Salem Open but lost in straight sets to Christopher Kas and Alexander Peya . He partnered Santiago González . At the US Open, he and partner González went out in the first round in straight sets to Jürgen Melzer and Philipp Petzschner , who went on to win the tournament. He next played at the Open de Moselle , where he partnered André Sá , going on to win the tournament by defeating Lukáš Dlouhý and Marcelo Melo in the final, winning in straight sets. Two weeks later, he won his second title of the year partnering with brother Andy Murray at the Rakuten Japan Open Tennis Championships . They defeated František Čermák and Filip Polášek . In doing so, he rose to a career-high doubles ranking of no. 23 in the world. Murray began 2012 playing at the Brisbane International partnering Paul Hanley for the first time. They made it into the second round, but lost in straight sets. At the Australian Open the pair lost in the first round in three sets to Julian Knowle and Michael Kohlmann . Murray got to his first final of the season again partnering Paul Hanley at the Open Sud de France , but lost the final to Nicolas Mahut and Édouard Roger-Vasselin in straight sets.

Having lost in the first round at the German Open , Murray next competed at the London 2012 Summer Olympics in the doubles event partnering Brother Andy, who was also competing in the singles event. [ 72 ] Jamie described partnering his brother at the London Olympics as a dream come true . Colin Fleming and Ross Hutchins also competed together to represent Great Britain in the doubles event. Unfortunately, the dream was not long lived as they lost in the first round to Austria ( Melzer / Peya ) in a very close three-setter. At the 2012 US Open , Murray had another disappointing campaign as he and partner André Sá lost in the first round to fifteenth seeds Peya / Soares in straight sets. They did, however, go on to reach the final of a challenger in Pétange the following week. The pair didn't go on to achieve much more in the remainder of the 2012 season, their most notable result coming at the Erste Bank Open where they reached the semi-finals. Murray then spent the final month of the season playing with a variety of different partners on the Challenger Tour . Murray began 2013 playing with fellow Scot , Colin Fleming . Their first tournament was the Brisbane International where they were only able to make the quarter-finals despite being second seeds. They followed this up with a poor showing at the Australian Open where they lost their opening match to Kohlmann / Nieminen in straight sets. Murray was close to sliding out of the doubles top 100 and contemplated quitting the sport altogether. [ 73 ] At the start of February 2013, Murray paired up with John Peers . This partnership looked to be more successful as they reached the semi-finals of their first tournament together, the Open Sud de France . They continued playing together and won their first title of the year at the US Men's Clay Court Championship , upsetting the top-seeded Bryan brothers in the final. [ 74 ] Murray in 2013 The pair played their first Grand Slam together at the French Open where they lost in the second round in three sets to the Colombian pairing of Cabal / Farah .

They followed this with a fairly successful grass court season where they reached the quarter-finals of the Aegon Championships and the semi-finals of the Aegon International . This gave them confidence heading into Wimbledon , however they lost in the first round to Blake / Melzer in a match where the deciding set finished 14–12 after lasting 87 minutes. [ 76 ] Not disheartened, Murray/Peers won their second ATP Tour title of the year only a few weeks later in Gstaad , [ 77 ] beating the Spanish pair of Andújar / García-López in the final. They followed this up with a strong showing at the Bet-at-home Cup where they reached the semi-finals. Next up was the US Open . The pair faced ninth seeds Marrero / Verdasco in their opening match and pulled off a shock, winning in straight sets. Two narrow three set wins followed over López / Sá as well as the American pairing of Baker / Ram . This resulted in Murray reaching his first ever Grand Slam quarter-final in the men's doubles. Murray/Peers would not progress any further, losing to second seeds Peya / Soares . [ 78 ] Murray/Peers had a highly successful Asian swing of tournaments, reaching back-to-back finals in Bangkok and Tokyo , winning the former against Bednarek / Brunström . In Shanghai , Murray reached only his second Masters 1000 semi-final, defeating established doubles champions Julien Benneteau , Nenad Zimonjic and Robert Lindstedt en route before losing in two tightly contested tiebreaks against Marrero / Verdasco . As a result of their successful first season as a pair, Murray/Peers finished 10th in the Race to London, only 665 points behind the 8th placed qualifiers. In November, the Lawn Tennis Association announced a dramatic cut in elite player funding with all financial support withdrawn from Britain's doubles specialists and any singles players aged over 24 to reduce the number of supported players from 16 this year to just six in 2014. [ 79 ] Murray started the 2014 year at Brisbane International with regular partner John Peers . The pair made it to the semi-finals before they lost to Daniel Nestor and Mariusz Fyrstenberg in straight sets. Their next tournament was the Heineken Open .
