Early life and career [ edit ] Born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma , [ 2 ] Amis Cameron worked as a Ford model before she began acting in the 1980s. She is best known for her role as Rose's granddaughter Lizzy in Titanic , and also appeared in films such as Fandango , The Usual Suspects , and The Ballad of Little Jo . [ 3 ] Muse Global Schools [ edit ] Main article: MUSE School In 2006, Amis Cameron co-founded Muse Global Schools , a Reggio -inspired, independent, nonprofit school in the Calabasas, California , area north of Los Angeles , with her sister, Rebecca Amis. [ 4 ] An exclusively plant-based diet was adopted in the fall of 2015, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and it is the country's first plant-based K-12 school with a 100% plant-based lunch program. [ 7 ] Additionally, the school is zero waste and 100% solar powered, with Solar Sun Flowers designed by her husband, James Cameron. [ 8 ] Environmental and plant-based activism [ edit ] In 2009, Amis Cameron founded [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Red Carpet Green Dress, a global initiative showcasing sustainable fashion on the red carpet at the Oscars . [ 11 ] Collaborating with fashion brands such as Armani , Vivienne Westwood , and Reformation, the gowns and tuxedos have included vintage, recycled, repurposed and eco design. Previous campaign ambassadors include Emma Roberts , Priyanka Bose , Naomie Harris , Olga Kurylenko , Kellan Lutz , Sophie Turner , and Missi Pyle . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In 2012, Amis and Cameron became vegan after watching the film Forks Over Knives . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] In 2014, Amis Cameron co-founded, with her husband, director James Cameron , and Craig McCaw, [ 17 ] Plant Power Task Force, an organization focused on showing the impact of animal agriculture on climate change and the environment. [ 18 ] Plant Power Task Force supported the first multi-country studies on global diets and climate change by the independent U.K.-based think tank, Chatham House: Livestock—Climate Change's Forgotten Sector and Changing Diets, Changing Climate. [ 19 ] They also spearheaded the MyPlate MyPlanet initiative in spring 2015, a platform for hundreds of environmental and health organizations in support of linking health and the environment in the U.S. Dietary Guidelines. [ 20 ] She also is a founder of Cameron Family Farms and Food Forest Organics, a plant-based café and market in New Zealand. [ 21 ] Her farm in New Zealand supports regenerative agriculture using 500-600 cattle livestock to improve the soil and help carbon sequestration . In an interview with NZ media the Cameron couple assured the audience that this was merely a pathway for other NZ farmers in their eventual transition, for the planet, to plant based agriculture, without livestock. A plant-based diet is, she explained, a healthier choice, despite their use of cattle on their land. A shortage of foreign labour during lockdown was another reason for keeping on the cattle, instead of making the transition to plant based agriculture as she and James Cameron had planned. [ 22 ] Book [ edit ] In fall 2018, Amis Cameron published the plant-based cookbook, OMD: Swap One Meal a Day to Get Healthy, Live Longer, and Save the Planet , with Simon & Schuster's Atria Publishing Group; in 2019, the paperback edition, The OMD Plan: Swap One Meal a Day to Save Your Health and Save the Planet , was published. [ 3 ] The OMD Plan was featured on Oprah Winfrey's Super Soul Sunday in Fall 2019. The book inspired Oprah Winfrey to eat one plant-based meal a day. [ 23 ] Personal life [ edit ] In 1986, she married actor Sam Robards , the son of Lauren Bacall and Jason Robards . Amis and Robards co-starred in the 1985 film Fandango . Their marriage produced a son, Jasper, before their divorce in 1994. [ 24 ] Although Amis and James Cameron met while filming Titanic , they did not marry at that time. Instead, Cameron married Linda Hamilton in 1997, and divorced two years later. [ 25 ] Amis and Cameron subsequently married in 2000, [ 26 ] and have three children. [ 27 ] In 2020, they became the permanent guardians for one of their daughter's teenage friends. [ 27 ] Amis, Cameron, and their family live in New Zealand, with a farm in the Wairarapa and a home in Wellington. https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/titanic-avatar-director-james-cameron-to-become-new-zealand-citizen-next-year-i-love-being-a-wellingtonian/3CSFOUZCEBB6PB7YTQ4US72XIE/ Filmography [ edit ] Year Title Role Notes 1984 Miami Vice Penny McGraw Episode: "Heart of Darkness" 1985 Fandango Debbie 1987 The Big Town Aggie Donaldson 1988 Plain Clothes Robin Torrence Rocket Gibraltar Aggie Rockwell 1989 Twister Maureen Cleveland 1990 Where the Heart Is Chloe McBain 1993 Rich in Love Rae Odom Watch It Anne The Ballad of Little Jo Josephine "Jo" Monaghan Alternative title: Little Man Jo Nominated— Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead Two Small Bodies Eileen Mahoney 1994 Blown Away Kate Dove Nadja Cassandra 1995 The Usual Suspects Edie Finneran National Board of Review Award for Best Cast 1996 Cadillac Ranch C.J.
