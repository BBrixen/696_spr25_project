A community to discuss the Academy Awards Members Online • Block-Busted Top 1% Commenter What do you think of Best Animated Feature Oscar nominees of 2021? Discussion These were Best Animated Feature Oscar nominees of 2021: - Onward - Over the Moon - A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon - Soul - Wolfwalkers I mostly agree with this, but I would've replaced Over the Moon with The Willoughbys , which would've diversified the list of nominees a bit more due to its stop-motion style that it has. If you will, which film would YOU have taken out with another nominee of your choice? P.S. As for which should've won... well... I'd say that it was a toss-up between Soul and Wolfwalkers .
