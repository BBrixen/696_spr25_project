It's where any kind of self-post that helps generate more in-depth discussion goes. Discuss gameplay, story, tips, post the latest news, and anything else related to Zelda!  THIS IS NOT a subreddit to state that older zelda games were the "TRUE" form of Zelda games. Read more below. Members Online • EvanHahn [ALL] Everything we know about the next Zelda game, as of March 2025 News In short: it'll probably emphasize player freedom, not be a "dungeon editor" game, and won't reuse the same map of Hyrule. See my post at Zelda Dungeon for more. I researched everything we know about the next Zelda game. Spoiler: we don't know much, but we know a few little details: The new game is probably well under way, but it'll be awhile before we see it. Zelda games typically start development right after the release of their predecessor, and interviews imply that they've already started the next one. But Nintendo has stated that longer development times are "inevitable" because games are more complex. The classic Zelda formula probably isn't coming back. Breath of the Wild charted a new direction for the series, emphasizing player freedom and an open world. A "Zelda Maker" is also unlikely. We probably won't see a game based around a dungeon/level editor. Multiple interviews discourage this idea. And they've already tried it: it was also the initial concept for Echoes of Wisdom, which they ultimately scrapped. The next game will probably not reuse the BotW/TotK Hyrule , and will feature a new setting. This is just a quick summary of what we know, based mostly on interviews. Not much, but not nothing!
