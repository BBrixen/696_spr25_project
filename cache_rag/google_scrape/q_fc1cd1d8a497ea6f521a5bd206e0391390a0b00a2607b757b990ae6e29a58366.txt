The U.S. team had a historic Winter Games, winning an unprecedented 37 medals. Team USA 's medal haul, which included nine gold, marked the first time since the 1932 Lake Placid Games that the U.S. earned more medals than any other participant. [ 2 ] The U.S. alpine ski team rebounded from a disappointing showing in 2006 by having its most successful Olympic performance ever, gathering a total of eight medals. Lindsey Vonn became the first American woman to win gold in the downhill event; while Bode Miller became the most successful U.S. alpine skier in history after winning gold in the super combined as well as two other medals. Medal winning performances by Julia Mancuso and Andrew Weibrecht contributed to the team's success. In Nordic combined , the U.S. team ended an 86-year drought during which the United States had not earned a single medal in the sport. Bill Demong won gold in the individual large hill/10 km, and Johnny Spillane won silver in both the individual normal hill/10 km and the individual large hill/10 km. Demong, Spillane, Todd Lodwick and Brett Camerota also won silver in the team event. Short track speed skater Apolo Ohno surpassed Bonnie Blair as the most decorated American Winter Olympic athlete in history with a total of eight medals in his Olympic career. Ohno gave the US relay team the final push for the bronze in the 5000 meter relay, and earned silver and bronze medals in the 1500 and 1000 meter individual events respectively. Women's 1000 meter silver medalist Katherine Reutter broke a streak dating back to 1994 in which no American woman had medaled in an individual short track event. Long track speed skater Shani Davis became the first man to win back-to-back gold in the 1000 meter event. Davis also earned a silver medal at 1500 meters, duplicating his Olympic results from four years earlier. Figure skater Evan Lysacek became the first American man to win the Olympic men's figure skating title since Brian Boitano in 1988 at Calgary .  Lysacek is also the first non- Russian or Unified Team skater to win the men's title since Boitano.  Ice dancers Meryl Davis and Charlie White won only the second silver medal in that discipline for the United States. The U.S. snowboard team also enjoyed success, garnering five medals overall. Shaun White defended his gold medal in men's halfpipe, as did Seth Wescott in men's snowboard cross. Hannah Teter and Kelly Clark won silver and bronze in women's halfpipe. The USA-1 four-man bobsled team, nicknamed "Night Train" and led by pilot Steve Holcomb , delivered the United States' first gold medal in the event since the St. Moritz Games in 1948. Holcomb's driving was described as "super-genius" by Kevin Kuske of the silver medal winning German team . [ 3 ] Brakeman Curtis Tomasevicz and pushers Steve Mesler and Justin Olsen rounded out the gold medal crew. The United States finished the 2010 Olympic Games by setting a new record for the most medals won by a single country at a Winter Olympics. The previous record of 36 was set by Germany at the 2002 Winter Olympics ; with the silver medal won by the men's hockey team in the final Olympic event of 2010, the U.S. earned their 37th medal of the Vancouver Games. [ 2 ] In addition, the U.S. team set a Winter Games record for bronze medals with 13, and the 15 silver medals by the U.S. was second only to the record of 16 set by Germany in 2002.
