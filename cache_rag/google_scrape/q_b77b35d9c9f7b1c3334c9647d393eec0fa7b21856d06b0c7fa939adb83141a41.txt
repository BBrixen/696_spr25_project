This morning, Netflix announced that Lesley Manville will be stepping into Princess Margaret’s shoes in The Crown Season 5, the Netflix drama’s penultimate season. The Oscar nominee joins Imelda Staunton in The Crown Season 5 cast, but additional casting news is being kept under wraps. After months of silence on The Crown front, Manville’s casting has prompted many fans to ask about the Netflix show’s future. When will Season 4 of The Crown be released? Who else is in The Crown Season 4 cast? Here’s everything you need to know about The Crown Season 4! WAS THE CROWN SEASON 4 RELEASE DATE IMPACTED BY THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC? While many Netflix shows had to halt production due to the COVID-19 pandemic, The Crown was not among them. The Emmy-winning drama finished filming its fourth season in early March, just days before the novel coronavirus shut down production across the UK. The show is currently in post-production, so Covid should not affect The Crown ‘s Season 4 release date too much. WHEN DOES THE CROWN SEASON 4 COME OUT? The Crown Season 4 is scheduled to be released on Netflix later this year. In the past, new seasons of The Crown have debuted in late November or December, so it’s likely that Season 4 will do the same. THE CROWN SEASON 4 CAST: OLIVIA COLMAN, HELENA BONHAM CARTER, AND MORE The Crown ‘s fourth season will be the last for Olivia Colman (Queen Elizabeth II), Helena Bonham Carter (Princess Margaret), Tobias Menzies (Prince Philip), Ben Daniels (Antony Armstrong-Jones, Margaret’s husband), and the rest of the cast. Because The Crown spans multiple generations, producers have opted to re-cast its ensemble every two seasons to ensure a realistic portrayal of the royal family. In addition to Colman, Bonham Carter, Menzies, and Daniels, The Crown Season 4 will introduce a variety of new characters, most notably Lady Diana Spencer (played by Emma Corrin) and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson). WHO IS IN THE CROWN SEASON 5 CAST? Manville is only the second cast member announced for The Crown Seasons 5 and 6. In November 2019, Harry Potter alum Imelda Staunton was tapped to star as Queen Elizabeth II in the show’s final iteration, which will bring the royal family into the early 2000s. That means no Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle, or Prince Andrew drama will appear in The Crown ‘s final season. https://twitter.com/TheCrownNetflix/status/1278599466845704192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1278599466845704192%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeadline.com%2F2020%2F07%2Fthe-crown-lesley-manville-to-play-princess-margaret-1202975819%2F As productions begin to resume amid the coronavirus pandemic, expect Netflix to announce more casting news in the months to come. IS WHOOPI GOLDBERG IN THE CROWN? As of now, there are no plans for Whoopi Goldberg to appear in The Crown . However, she did dress up as Queen Elizabeth I when she hosted the 1999 Oscars, so perhaps we’ll get a shot of the queen watching the awards show in the final season? Pop culture lovers can only hope.
