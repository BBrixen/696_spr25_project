LONDON, ENGLAND - NOVEMBER 13: Rafael Nadal of Spain celebrates his victory over Daniil Medvedev of ... More Russia during Day Four of the Nitto ATP World Tour Finals at The O2 Arena on November 13, 2019 in London, England. (Photo by TPN/Getty Images) Getty Images Rafael Nadal can thank his buddy Roger Federer for helping him earn the year-end No. 1 ATP Ranking for a fifth time. Nadal’s position at the summit of the year-end ATP rankings was solidified when Federer beat Novak Djokovic, 6-4, 6-3, Thursday evening in the Nitto ATP Finals in London. At 33, Nadal is the oldest player to finish year-end No. 1 in the history of the ATP Rankings (since 1973). He has on-court career earnings north of $115 million. “I’m sure Rafa was watching,” Federer told Brad Gilbert of ESPN in an on-court interview. “I’ve been in that position before. It’s great always to finish a year-end No. 1 and we know how tough Novak is on the indoors. When somebody goes out like this, I think everybody goes, ‘Alright, like maybe we can win it.’ And I was the guy who beat Novak so I hope it’s going to give me a whole lot of confidence going into the semis.” Djokovic will finish at No. 2, with Federer at No. 3, continuing the “Big Three’s dominance” atop the rankings. Nadal, 33, has had quite the 2019. Last month he got married to his longtime girlfriend, Maria Francisca Perello, in Majorca, Spain. He won two Grand Slam titles, including his 12th Roland Garros and his fourth U.S. Open title, and also reached the Australian Open final, losing to Djokovic. Nadal now has 19 Grand Slam titles, one behind Federer’s 20, and could tie and pass the Swiss in 2020.

The Mallorcan is also the first player to finish No. 1 five times in non-consecutive years. The 11-year gap between his first year-end No. 1 season (2008) and his last (2019) is also a record.

More Russia during Day Four of the Nitto ATP World Tour Finals at The O2 Arena on November 13, 2019 in London, England. (Photo by TPN/Getty Images) Getty Images Nadal is the fifth player to finish the year at the top of men’s professional tennis on five or more occasions, following in the footsteps of Pete Sampras (6), Jimmy Connors (5), Federer (5) and Djokovic (5), via the ATP. This is the 16th straight season that the year-end World No. 1 ranking has been held by a member of the ‘Big Four’ — Federer (2004-07, ’09), Nadal (2008, ’10, ’13, ’17, ‘19), Djokovic (2011-12, ’14-15, ‘18) or Andy Murray (2016). "Rafa has had another incredible season and fully deserves this accolade for a remarkable fifth time in his career,” ATP Executive Chairman and President Chris Kermode said. “Since the inception of the ATP Rankings in 1973, only 17 players can lay claim to finishing year-end No.1 - it’s unquestionably one of the toughest achievements in all sport. On behalf of ATP, many congratulations to Rafa and his team." This week, Nadal is aiming to clinch his first title at the ATP Finals, which he has qualified for a record 15 straight occasions (nine appearances) since 2005. Nadal will be presented with the ATP Tour No. 1 trophy at The O2 this week. It is the ninth time in the past 19 years that year-end No. 1 has been decided at the final tournament of the season — 2000 (Gustavo Kuerten), 2001-02 (Lleyton Hewitt), 2003 (Andy Roddick), 2009 (Federer), 2013 (Nadal), 2014 (Djokovic) and 2016 (Murray).
