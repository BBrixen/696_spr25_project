We built a tracker to follow Tesla’s income catching up to Musk’s compensation, which sounds like a ridiculous thing to say about a major company. Musk’s lawyers recently launched a second effort to reinstate his 2018 Tesla CEO compensation plan, which is worth $55 billion in Tesla stocks, through a sponsored state bill on top of the Delaware Supreme Court appeal . A Delaware judge canceled the package after lawyers sued on behalf of Tesla shareholders. The judge determined that Tesla wasn’t upfront when it presented the package to shareholders as Musk was in control of Tesla’s board and basically “negotiated” the package with himself. Advertisement - scroll for more content Musk claimed that the judge’s decision was politically motivated, but he never directly addressed any of the governance issues highlighted in the decision. Regardless of the merit of the case, there’s a metric that is hard to argue when it comes to the compensation package: it’s worth more than Tesla’s entire accumulated net income since inception. We created a tracker to check the progress on when Tesla’s net income could reach the level of Musk’s compensation plan: Elon Musk’s $55 billion compensation package Tesla’s net income since inception 50% 75% 100% Tesla earns $222.5/sec $0 0% of $55B Projected to reach $55B: … Based on Tesla’s accumulated net income as of Jan 1, 2025 As of now, Tesla’s net income will reach $55 billion around the end of 2027. That’s based on Tesla’s 2024 net income, which was down 50% compared to 2023. If Musk’s appeal is successful, Tesla would have given its CEO the equivalent of 1.6 times its net income since inception. We will update the tracker every quarter with a different rate based on the latest net income. Electrek’s Take In other words, Tesla plans to give Elon Musk more money than it has positively generated since its inception. People often like to justify Musk’s outrageous compensation package by comparing it to Tesla’s rise in stock price, but that’s not the appropriate metric. The stock price and company valuation are purely based on what people are willing to pay for it. Top comment by Dan B Liked by 33 people Kind of off topic, yet still on topic. Some on here may know that I work at a dealership with Mazda and Volvo. I've been here since early 2016 (nearly 9 years in total). From 2016 till Jan. 1st, 2025, our dealership has probably traded in two or three Tesla's overall. Since Jan 1st 2025, we have traded in more than 6 with two in just the past 4 days (Model Y and Model 3).  Both newer cars with lower miles.  As I type this, we have someone trying to trade another Model 3. It's happening.  Tesla is truly in trouble. View all comments The company’s net income is the only accurate metric to follow Tesla’s profits: Year Net Income (USD Millions) 2003 – (n/a) 2004 -2.4 2005 -11.6 2006 -30.0 2007 -78.2 2008 -82.8 2009 -55.7 2010 -154.3 2011 -254.4 2012 -396.2 2013 -74 2014 -294 2015 -889 2016 -675 2017 -1,962 2018 -976 2019 -862 2020 690 2021 5,524 2022 12,583 2023 14,999 2024 7,130 If it wasn’t for the Delaware judge, Musk would already have the package as of early last year when Tesla’s net income was at less than half of his package. Based on the latest estimates for the first quarter, I would expect the completion date to $55 billion to be pushed into the next decade. It gives value to the argument of Musk’s critics that Tesla is his personal piggy bank. Add Electrek to your Google News feed. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.
