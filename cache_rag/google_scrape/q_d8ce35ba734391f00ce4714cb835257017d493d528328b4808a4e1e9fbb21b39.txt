Media Release Fifteen K-12 science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) teachers from across the United States have been named 2020-2021 Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellows. The fellows will spend 11 months serving in a Federal agency or U.S. Congressional offices in Washington, D.C., engaged in the national STEM education arena. Statement from Kama: Einstein Fellows work in either a Federal agency or U.S. Congressional office for 11 months. I will be working with the US Geological Survey, which is the science arm of the Department of the Interior. Specifically, I will be working from the Youth and Education in Science (YES) office on a variety of projects to engage youth, teachers, and the public. With the YES office, I will be focused on our mutual priorities of: 1) diversity and inclusion with specific projects; 2) bringing USGS data into classrooms; and 3) building connections to support communities of learners in STEM. While we work in our separate offices, we Fellows will also do a lot of collaboration and learning together. I also hope to stay connected with students and teachers here in Lincoln County School District, providing support with science, math, or even government and history, since I will be in our nation’s capital. I’ll miss my students and colleagues during my absence, but my dream is to return to LCSD with a stronger sense of how to engage all students in education and increase the number of students that ultimately go into STEM professions. Congratulations, Kama!
