Per the press release, "players will conduct interviews with NBA teams and participate in five-on-five games, shooting and strength and agility drills June 22-25.

Chris Duarte, likely a first-rounder, is also skipping the event. International prospects¬†Usman Garuba, Josh Giddey and Alperen Sengun also won't be in attendance. But a number of top prospects will be in Chicago, including USC big man Evan Mobley,¬†G League Ignite prospects Jalen Green and Jonathan Kuminga, Florida State forward Scottie Barnes and Tennessee Guard Keon Johnson. Cunningham and Suggs likely would benefit very little from participating in the combine. In fact, had any of the other five prospects‚ÄîCunningham, Suggs, Mobley, Green and Kumina make up the list, not necessarily in that order‚Äîchosen to skip the combine, very few people would have been surprised. They are pretty locked in as the top five options in this year's draft. "That top five is potentially as stout as any of the other drafts [since 2000]," a high-ranking NBA executive told ESPN's Mike Schmitz last week. "There are years where the No. 1 pick would never be the No. 1 pick ever again. Some drafts lack that No. 1 pick. This one's legit. I'm a big fan. There's legit star power [in the top 5]." The combine is the chance for prospects further down draft boards to improve their stock and impress teams in interviews and workouts. But for the very top prospects who have already proven their upside and ability, any possibility of making a bad impression isn't a risk worth taking. 01:04 Rockets-Dubs Gets Chippy Again TOP NEWS John Haliburton Apologizes Bleacher Report -2271s Latest Projections and Pro Comps ‚úçÔ∏è Bleacher Report 18h üö® Stephon Castle Wins ROY Bleacher Report 2h Pacers Eliminate Bucks in OT Bleacher Report 25m Updated NBA Playoff Bracket Bleacher Report 31m TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d 1 Trade Every NBA Playoff Team Wishes It Could Make Right Now Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 14h Cooper Flagg, Dylan Harper, Full List of Early 2025 NBA Draft Declarations Announced Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 9h Lakers' Luka Doncic Gifts $5K to Restore Vandalized Kobe, Gigi Bryant Mural Donƒçiƒá donates $5K to repair vandalized tribute of Kobe and Gigi (KTLA) Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 12h Michael Porter Jr. Not Suspended for Leaving Bench During Nuggets-Clippers Skirmish Michael Porter Jr. not suspended Game 5 for leaving bench during skirmish Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 3h Jalen Brunson, Knicks Fail to Close out Cade, Pistons in G5 Loss, Disappoint NBA Fans New York loses Game 5 at MSG, still ahead 3-2 in series üì≤ TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d 1 Trade Every NBA Playoff Team Wishes It Could Make Right Now Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 14h Cooper Flagg, Dylan Harper, Full List of Early 2025 NBA Draft Declarations Announced Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 9h Lakers' Luka Doncic Gifts $5K to Restore Vandalized Kobe, Gigi Bryant Mural Donƒçiƒá donates $5K to repair vandalized tribute of Kobe and Gigi (KTLA) Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 12h Michael Porter Jr. Not Suspended for Leaving Bench During Nuggets-Clippers Skirmish Michael Porter Jr. not suspended Game 5 for leaving bench during skirmish Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 3h Jalen Brunson, Knicks Fail to Close out Cade, Pistons in G5 Loss, Disappoint NBA Fans New York loses Game 5 at MSG, still ahead 3-2 in series üì≤ Bleacher Report About Advertise Contact Us Get Help Careers Sitemap Community Guidelines Privacy Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information Terms Of Use AdChoices B/R Sports on MAX B/R Creators Program Copyright ¬© 2025 Bleacher Report, Inc.
