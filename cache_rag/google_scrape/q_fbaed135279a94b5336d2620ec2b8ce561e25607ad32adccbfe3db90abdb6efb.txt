I use it every day. It helps research a subject with much more specific and targeted results than leaving it up to a search engine. Or kickstart a PowerPoint presentation to give me some prompter ideas when trying to write a document or report, but I can’t work out how to start. Once you learn a bit about how to write good prompts it’s very easy to use particularly when it’s integrated into all of Office 365 tools and when it’s part of your organisation and it has access to all internal documents.
