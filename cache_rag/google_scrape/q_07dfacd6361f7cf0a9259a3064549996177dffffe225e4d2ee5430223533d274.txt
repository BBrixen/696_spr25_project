The company's long-awaited Q1 earnings report revealed a 20% drop in automotive revenue, falling to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period of 2024. Overall revenue also saw a decline of 9%, settling at $19.34 billion. The results fell short of analysts' expectations, which had predicted revenue of $21.11 billion. The drop in automotive revenue, a core component of Tesla's business, was attributed in part to necessary updates at its four vehicle manufacturing facilities. These upgrades are underway to facilitate the production of a refreshed version of the highly popular Model Y . Tesla also pointed to lower average selling prices and increased sales incentives as factors that negatively impacted both revenue and overall profitability during the quarter. Net income for the first quarter experienced a big downturn, plummeting by 71% to $409 million, or $0.12 per share. This is a considerable decrease compared to the $1.39 billion, or $0.41 per share, reported in the first quarter of the previous year. Operating income also saw a substantial decline of 66%, falling to $400 million from $1.17 billion, resulting in an operating margin of just 2.1%. The company indicated that this decrease in operating profit was influenced by lower vehicle selling prices, a reduction in the number of vehicles delivered, and increased expenses related to its artificial intelligence initiatives. Earlier in April , Tesla reported a 13% year-over-year decrease in vehicle deliveries for the first quarter, totaling 336,681 units. Adding to the complexities, Tesla acknowledged the increasing uncertainty within the automotive and energy sectors. The company highlighted that rapidly evolving trade policies are negatively affecting the global supply chain and the cost structure for Tesla and its competitors in the EV market. Tesla noted that this dynamic environment, coupled with shifting political sentiment, could have a considerable short-term impact on the demand for its electric cars. Looking ahead, Tesla refrained from providing specific growth projections for the remainder of 2025. The company stated its intention to "revisit our 2025 guidance" during its second-quarter update, indicating a cautious approach to future forecasts amidst the current market volatility. Tesla's energy generation and storage business was the only positive news as it demonstrated strong growth, with revenue jumping by 67% to $2.73 billion. The company emphasized that the expanding infrastructure for artificial intelligence is creating significant opportunities for its energy storage products, which play a crucial role in grid stabilization and energy management. Despite the challenges, Tesla reaffirmed its commitment to key strategic initiatives. The company remains on track for a pilot launch of its driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, by June. Additionally, Tesla plans to start pilot production of its humanoid robots at its Fremont, California, facility later this year. The market responded to the results in a surprisingly calm way, with shares trading at $238.55 at the time of writing (after-hours trading). Source This article contains localized units and prices.
