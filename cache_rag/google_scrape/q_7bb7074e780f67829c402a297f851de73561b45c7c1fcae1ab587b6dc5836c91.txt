He’s won 5 Oscars, 2 Palme d’Or awards, and many other accolades. He’s one of the most highly decorated filmmakers ever, yet unlike pals like Spielberg and Scorsese who’ve continued to work at mostly a very high level, or even a guy like De Palma who has at least continued to work, Coppola has made only three movies this century and his last one a decade ago. Although he’s made four movies that I rate 10/10, and multiple other interesting movies, I don’t consider him a personal favorite filmmaker. I wonder, as something I look at on occasion, if it’s partially because I’m not sure who he is as a filmmaker. Although some of his best movies are of an almost operatic nature, I don’t know what is distinctly Coppola about him as a filmmaker. Certainly the amazing cinematography of Gordon Willis ties together The Godfather movies, but what is there that’s Coppola? I hope others will join me in trying to explore that part of the conversation (eh, see what I did there?). What do you think of Coppola, FG? Who is he as a filmmaker and what do you think of his movies? My ratings for what I’ve seen of his: The Godfather - 10/10 (my all time #2) Apocalypse Now - 10/10 (my all time #21) The Conversation - 10/10 The Godfather part II - 10/10 The Godfather part III - 8/10 Rumble Fish - 8/10 The Outsiders - 8/10 The Rainmaker - 8/10 Peggy Sue Got Married - 7/10 Bram Stoker’s Dracula - 3/10 Jack - 3/10 What about you, FG?
