Want to know more about this? Then contact us and we will be happy to assist you further. Practical Examples of the Microsoft HoloLens 2 The Microsoft HoloLens 2 is an Augmented/Mixed reality headset released in 2019. At present, the HoloLens 2 is globally recognised as the most widely used Augmented Reality-bril. This is partly due to the excellent build quality of the headset, but also the available software. Industry & Manufacturing: HoloLens 2 Mixed Reality Use Cases Bosch uses AR-toepassingen for training on complex vehicle repair tasks. For instance, there is a special AR-training to recalibrate the sensors of driver assistance systems after a windscreen replacement. Here, it is important to see the entire vehicle. The new HoloLens 2 offers a much larger field of view than earlier products. This allows more details to be displayed and larger objects to be viewed up close. The wearing comfort of the HoloLens 2 has also been significantly improved.

By wearing a special headset with HoloPatient-software, the patient appears lifelike in the nurse's room. MMC prepares nurses for the treatment of COVID-19 patients in the hospital with this method. MMC is the first hospital in the Netherlands to offer this innovative training form with a COVID-19 patient to nurses.

With the CPR+ app from Velicus and the HoloLens 2 on their heads, students learn to perform CPR with a defibrillator (AED) and also cover the recovery position. With the mixed reality-reanimatiecursus, trainees can learn, practice, and test CPR independently of time and place, in a playful manner. This can all be done in modules without compromising on quality. Velicus' CPR course meets all requirements and is officially certified by Het Oranje Kruis.

Besides a physical tour, it is possible to book a mixed reality-tour in the church. You wear a Microsoft HoloLens 2 and with the AR-headset, you take a tour through the museum and look at various images and objects. For example, it is possible to look at an ancient painting through the headset and see it come to life before your eyes. Read more: M Leuven Conclusion Augmented reality can be applied in many more ways than you might initially think. The above examples clearly show that AR can be used in various fields. Training and op-/guiding staff seems to be the most common application of the HoloLens 2 at the moment, but who knows, we might see many more unique and innovative ways in which augmented reality can be used in the future.
