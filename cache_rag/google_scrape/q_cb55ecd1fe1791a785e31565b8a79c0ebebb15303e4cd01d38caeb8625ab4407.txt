Members Online • Saxyman76 The junior singles careers of the ATP Top 20 (as of 23/8/2021) Stats/Analysis Novak Djokovic - Nole was a fairly successful junior, considering that he didn't play any events in his final year of eligibility (2005). He picked up 2 titles (both G4), and finished with a career high of 24 in February 2004.  His best result at a Grand Slam was a semi-final appearance at the 2004 AO. In the latter half of 2004, Djokovic abandoned junior events in favour of competing on the Futures tour. Danill Medvedev - Medvedev was a very successful junior, who did compete in his final junior year (2014). He picked up 8 titles (1 G1, 3 G2, 2 G4 and 2 G5), and had a career high of 13 in January 2014. However, he never made it very far in the slams, only making it into the 3rd round of the USO and RG. Stefanos Tsitsipas - Tsitsipas was a junior no 1, having won the prestigious grade A tournament 57° Trofeo Bonfiglio in 2016. This is an addition to his 2 other titles (GB1 and G5). Tsitsipas's top ranking can be attributed to his deep runs in 3 of 2016's slams (1 SF, 2 QF), as well as a final appearance in the 2015 Orange Bowl (which he lost to Miomir Kecmanovic, a result you'd be shocked these days).  Its fair to say that Stefanos has had a pretty smooth transistion from juniors to pros, being 2018's ATP most improved player and breaking into the top 10 just 3 years after his 2016 junior season. Rafael Nadal - The king of clay only ever played 2 junior events: 2002 Junior Wimbledon in which he made the semifinals and the Junior Davis Cup final, in which he won 5 of 5 matches to bring the cup home to Spain. These two events gave him a career best of 145, however it is almost certain that he could have been a top 10 player had he played more events in 2002 and 2003 (considering he reached world number 49 in 2003). Putting it simply, Nadal had no interest in junior events, as he was competing in Futures and Challengers before he played at Junior Wimbledon. Alexander Zverev - The German was another junior no 1, who managed to hold his position to finish Year-end champion of 2013. He won 6 titles (2 GA, 2 G1, 1 G4, 1G5), including the 2014 Australian Open Junior Champs (his final junior tournament) and the 2013 trofeo bonfiglio. What is remarkable about his success is that Zverev was world number 1 aged 16, and didn't even compete in his final year (2015), or in his second to last year past January. If he had, it is highly likely that he would have won atleast 2 more grand slams, as well as finish year end champion of 2014 and 2015. This just showcases Zverev's immense talent, and it is highly likely that he may finish year end number 1 in the following years on the senior tour. Dominic Thiem - The tenacious Austrian was a junior no 2 in 2011, after having a highly successful final year on the Junior circuit. He won 4 titles that year (1 GA, 2 G1, 1 G2) to add to a total of 11 titles across his entire junior career (1 GA, 6 G1, 2G2, 1G4, 1G5). Thiems biggest win came at his penultimate tournament, the 2011 Orange Bowl, where he demolished countryman Patrick Ofner 6-1 6-0 in the final. Replicating his senior career, he was a finalist of the 2011 Roland Garros Junior Championships, after a close 3 set loss to Bjorn Fratangelo. Andrey Rublev - Rublev was an incredibly successful junior player, with a remarkable set of accolades. Firstly he was Zverevs successor as the 2014 year-end junior no 1, and could have certainly been a 2015 no 1 had he competed in more than one event that year. That event, was the inaugural ITF Junior Masters (the juniors equivalent of the ATP Year-End Championships), which he won by beating Taylor Fritz in a hotly contested final. Rublev picked up 5 titles throughout his career (1 JM, 1GA, 1 G1, 1 G2, 1 G5), including the 2014 Roland Garros junior championships. Rubweeh is certainly a junior player who has replicated his success on the senior tour, and personally, is a player I love to watch. Matteo Berrettini - Berrettini was a successful junior, having a career high of 52 in 2014. He picked up 6 titles (1 G2, 1 G3, 2 G4, 2 G5), but none of them were prestigious Grade A or Grade 1 level. Berrettini never made it past the 3rd round of a Junior Grand Slam, indicating that he didn't quite have the weapons needed to beat the big junior big guns. As far as the senior tour goes, he was a moderately late bloomer, not cracking the top 20 til 2019. Roger Federer - The maestro was successful right from the start, being a world number 1 in 1998. His biggest achievement came at the tournament he saw so much senior success in, winning the 1998 Junior Championships in both the singles and doubles. Federer picked up 5 titles in his career (2 GA, 3G2), which included the 1998 Orange Bowl (notice a trend here). Considering the fact that he didn't compete at all in 1999 (his last year as a junior), its safe to say Federer was every bit as successful on the junior tour as he is on the seniors. Denis Shapovalov - Born the year after Federer won Junior Wimbledon, Shapovalov's junior success is still in fairly recent memory. His career high ranking of 2 in 2016 came after 2 big titles: Nike Junior International at Roehampton (Grade 1), and the Junior Wimbledon championships (18 years after Fed won it). Shapovalov was decorated with 5 titles (1 GA, 1 G1, 1 G4, 2 G5), despite not even competing in his final year (2017, again noticing a trend?). Casper Ruud - Yet another incredibly successful junior, Ruud was junior number 1 in Junaruy 2016, and year end number 2 for 2015. He captured 5 titles (1 GA, 3 G1, 1 G4) in his career including the Grade A Osaka Mayors Cup in 2015, and amazingly, he won all 3 Grade 1 tournaments of his career in back to back weeks (January 5 - Janurary 25). This was a feat that he also achieved on the main tour this year, winning 3 back to back 250 tournaments before the Olympics. The last major accolade that Ruud achieved was making the final of the 2016 Junior Masters, where he lost to Seon Chan Hong in two closely fought sets. Pablo Carreno Busta - The Spaniard is now 30 years old, meaning that his last junior year was all the way back in 2009. In this year, he reached a career high ranking of 6, after capturing 4 titles throughout his junior career (2 G1, 1 G3, 1G5). One crazy fact about him is that PCB won his debut tournament, aged 16 years old! Carreno Busta never made it far in the junior slams, or made any appearances at the Grade A events, however he was still a highly successful junior who has converted that success on the senior tour. Hubert Hurkacz - The Pole is another player in the Top 20 who was born in 1997 (along with Zverev and Rublev), who had a slightly more under the radar junior career. He reached a career high ranking of 29 in January 2015, and captured just 2 titles (1 G4, 1 G5). In all fairness, Hurkacz did make 4 finals of Grade 1 and 2 tournaments, so he did have a few deep runs in to high level tourneys. Overall, Hurkacz's junior career was highly successful, but not exceptional like many of the other players on the list. Diego Schwartzman - The argentine was never much a junior tour player having reached a career high of just 217 in April 2009. He won just one title, a G5 in Argentina in 2009. He played just 11 tournaments from September 2008 to USO 2010. Schwartzman prioritised futures tournaments in 2010, however didn't find much success there either. Schwartzman was definetly a late bloomer, not winning an ATP tournament till 2016. Jannik Sinner - It is a well known fact that Sinner had little success on the junior tour, but this can mainly be attributed to his early start on the Challenger tour in his final junior years. He reached a career high of 133 in January 2018, after winning two grade 4 tournaments in 2017. Sinner competed at just one Grade A tournament, the 2018 Trofea Bonfiglio, which he made the Quarterfinals of. Sinner had a meteoric rise in 2019 (his final year as a junior), having won 2 challenger tour titles and the NextGen finals. Therefore we'll never know what his true junior potential could have been, like many of the other players on this list. Roberto Bautista Agut - The 1988 born in Spaniard competed strongly on the tour, reaching a career high of 47 in July 2006. He won 4 titles (1 G2, 3 G5), with no deep runs in any of the Slams or Grade A tournaments. RBA is another player who has matured much later in his career, having not broken into the ATP top 50 till 2014 (age 26). Felix Auger-Alliassime - The precocious young Canadian was an incredibly talented junior, having climbed to world number 2 in 2016, aged 16 . He won 5 titles (1 GA, 2 G1, 1 G3, 1 G5), including the 2016 Junior US Open aged 16 (beating 18 year old Stefanos Tsitsipas in the semifinal). He also lead Canada to a 2016 Junior Davis Cup win, beating Seb Korda in the semifinal. He also made the finals of 2016 junior Roland Garros, losing to frenchman Geoffrey Blancaneaux in three sets. It is remarkable that he was world number 2 and a grand slam winner in his 3rd to last year as a junior. Hopefully he can find that strength on the senior tour, and win his first ATP title (as he is 0-8 in finals so far!). Alex de Minaur - The fleetfooted Australian was another world number 2, having competing strongly in 2016 (his second-to-last year as a junior, although he didn't play any junior events in 2017). He actually picked up both of his tour titles back in 2014 aged 15 (G3 and G4), because he was unable to convert in any of the finals of the higher grade tournaments he competed in later on. One of these was the 2016 junior US Open, which of course, he lost to FAA. Another was the Grade 1 Eddie Herr international in the US, which he lost to, you guessed it, FAA. De Minaur could have probably climbed to world number 1 in 2017 had he played any of the events that year. David Goffin - Goffin was a highly successful junior, having reached a career high of 10 in 2008. Goffin won just two titles (1 G1, 1 G3), but it was his runner-up finish at the 2008 Grade A Trofeo Bonfligio (a very popular tournament it seems) that earned him most of his ranking points. Goffin is another later bloomer, not breaking into the top 20 till 2015. Cristian Garin - Rounding out the top 20, we have the 1996 born Chilean. In 2013, he reached a career high of world number 4, but was yet another player who never competed in his final junior year (2014). He picked up 3 titles (1 GA, 1 G1, 1G5), which included the 2013 Junior Roland Garros (beating an empassioned Alexander Zverev in the final). Garin was a highly successful junior, who probably could have been a junior no 1 had he competed in 2014. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.
