They direct most of their work together, and their work has grossed more than 6.8 billion worldwide, making them the third-highest-grossing directors of all time. They are best known for directing four films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU): Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). Endgame grossed over $2.798 billion worldwide, briefly becoming the highest-grossing film of all time . The brothers have also worked as directors and producers on the comedy series Arrested Development (2003–2005), Community (2009–2014), and Happy Endings (2011–2012). They won a Primetime Emmy Award for Arrested Development . Early life and education [ edit ] Anthony Russo (born February 3, 1970) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and Joseph Russo (born July 18, 1971) [ 2 ] [ 3 ] were born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio , the sons of Patricia Gallupoli and attorney and judge Basil Russo . [ 4 ] Their parents are both of Italian descent. [ 5 ] Their paternal and maternal families emigrated from Sicily and Abruzzo , respectively, and settled in Ohio. [ 4 ] They attended Benedictine High School . [ 6 ] Joe graduated from the University of Iowa and majored in English and writing, while Anthony graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and majored in business before switching to English. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Career [ edit ] 1997–2013: Directorial debut and sitcom work [ edit ] The Russo brothers were graduate students at Case Western Reserve University (where Anthony studied law and Joe studied acting at UEA) when they began directing, writing, and producing their first feature, Pieces. They financed the film with student loans and credit cards. [ 10 ] After viewing Pieces at the Slamdance Film Festival , Steven Soderbergh approached the duo and offered to produce their next film, along with his producing partner George Clooney . [ 10 ] This project was the crime comedy Welcome to Collinwood , starring William H. Macy , Sam Rockwell , and Clooney. [ 11 ] FX Networks executive Kevin Reilly hired the Russos to direct the pilot for the series Lucky , having liked the pair's work on Collinwood . Ron Howard was a fan of the pilot, and he had a hand in hiring the brothers to direct the pilot for Fox 's Arrested Development . [ 10 ] From 2009 to 2014 they were an integral part of the NBC sitcom Community having directed 34 episodes. They gained critical acclaim and notoriety for having directed the episodes " A Fistful of Paintballs " and " For a Few Paintballs More " which served as the season two finale. This would become an unofficial series of episodes featuring paintball , with the first, " Modern Warfare " being directed by Justin Lin . Alan Sepinwall of Uproxx wrote that the "comparison is nothing short of The Godfather Part II of sitcom episodes". [ 12 ] After watching the season 2 finale, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige hired the Russos to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] 2014–2019: Marvel Cinematic Universe [ edit ] In 2014, the Russo brothers directed their first film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe , the action mystery thriller film Captain America: The Winter Soldier starring Chris Evans as Captain America . This serves as the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) directed by Joe Johnston . The Winter Soldier received critical acclaim, with Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praising its tackling of serious subject matter, comparing it favorably to The Dark Knight (2008). [ 15 ] The film was a financial success earning $714 million worldwide. [ 16 ] They directed the third film in the Captain America trilogy entitled Captain America: Civil War (2016) which also was a success both critically and commercially. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] In 2017, the brothers founded the production company AGBO . [ 19 ] The Russo brothers directed Avengers: Infinity War (2018), which became the first superhero movie to gross over $2 billion at the box office. They are the third directors to make a $2 billion movie after James Cameron 's films Avatar and Titanic and J. J. Abrams 's film Star Wars: The Force Awakens . Its sequel, Avengers: Endgame , was released on April 26, 2019, broke numerous box office records , and became the second superhero movie to gross over $2 billion. [ 20 ] They join James Cameron as the only directors to make two $2 billion films. [ 21 ] 2020–2024: Streaming films and criticism [ edit ] The Russos also served as producers of the film Everything Everywhere All At Once , written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert . [ 22 ] The film, released in theatres in March 2022, is A24 's highest-grossing film worldwide at the box office. [ 23 ] The brothers are financing the Los Angeles and Beijing joint-production company Anthem & Song, which is producing the Chinese superhero film The Hero's Awakening . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Since leaving the MCU , the Russo brothers directed a string of films for streaming outlets such as the Apple TV+ crime drama Cherry (2021) starring Tom Holland and the Netflix action thriller The Gray Man starring Chris Evans , Ryan Gosling and Ana de Armas . Both films received negative reviews. The duo reunited with Netflix for the science-fiction action film The Electric State (2025) starring Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt . To date, it is the worst reviewed film of their career, receiving a mere 15% score on Rotten Tomatoes . Lindsey Bahr of The Associated Press wrote, "It’s lacking a spark and a soul that might distinguish it as memorable or special. Worse, considering everything it has going for it, The Electric State is kind of dull." [ 26 ] In a review for the film, New York Post ' s Johnny Oleksinski noted the Russo brothers' directing efforts after Avengers: Endgame as "some of the worst and priciest movies of the past six years". He panned the film's lack of originality. [ 27 ] 2025–present: Return to the MCU [ edit ] At San Diego Comic-Con in July 2024, Marvel Studios announced that the Russo brothers would return to direct and produce Avengers: Doomsday (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027). [ 28 ] Business interests [ edit ] In January 2025, Joe Russo was announced as a board member and investor of English football club Sheffield United . The club was taken over by the consortium group COH Sports led by fellow American businessmen Steve Rosen and Helmy Eltoukhy . [ 29 ] Joe was joined on the board of directors by former Cleveland Cavaliers CEO Len Komoroski and real estate figure Terry Ahern.
