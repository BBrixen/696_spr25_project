(Credit: Tesla) Share Tweet Published 6 years ago on October 23, 2019 By Simon Alvarez Tesla’s ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) third-quarter earnings call comes on the heels of a blockbuster earnings report that saw the electric car maker prove its critics wrong by posting a surprise profit and showing earnings per share of $1.91, far beyond Wall St’s expec. By beating Wall Street’s estimates, Tesla appears to be on the cusp of changing the narrative surrounding the company’s immediate future once more. As revealed in the company’s Q3 2019 Update Letter, Tesla is GAAP profitable once more . The company is also seeing free cash flow, something that was largely unexpected during the days leading up to the earnings report. For today’s earnings call, Tesla’s executives are expected to address questions surrounding the company’s plans for the immediate and CEO Elon Musk’s apparent ability to now underpromise and overdeliver. Tesla stock is currently trading + 20.30% at $ 306.38 in after-hours trading. The earnings call will likely affect these results further, for better or for worse. The following are live updates from Tesla’s Q3 2019 earnings call. I will be updating this article in real-time, so please keep refreshing the page to view the latest updates on this story. 16:35 PT – And that concludes the third-quarter earnings call! We saw a far more tempered, far more restrained Elon Musk, and a more confident Zach Kirkhorn. Calm, composed and quick, this earnings call appears to be one of Tesla’s smoothest yet. I’m inclined to be more optimistic about the company’s future after this Q&A session. And it appears that the company’s shareholders are too. At the end of the call, TSLA stock has remained where it was when the session started. No wild swings — and everyone’s the better for it. Advertisement 16:34 PT – Dan Levy from Credit Suisse questions Gigafactory 3’s Model 3 production ramp, and how smooth will it be. Elon notes that he is optimistic about Gigafactory 3’s ramp, but not on a week-by-week basis. This is quite impressive for Elon Musk. In previous earnings calls where he was much more emotionally charged, I can’t help but think that he would have given an ambitious estimate as a response. Not so much anymore. 16:30 PT – Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research asks about how Tesla’s thinking about Model S and X have evolved, and if Model 3 has cannibalized sales of the flagships. Elon explains that the S and X are niche products, made in low volumes and higher prices. “We continue to make them more for sentimental reasons than anything else,” Musk said, adding that “If you’re buying an electric (full-sized sedan) and you don’t buy a Model S, you’re making a mistake.” It is evident from Elon’s statements that the Model S still holds a special, special place in his heart. Kirkhorn did state that Model S and X are seeing more production lately due to increasing demand. Though delivery numbers for the Model S and X this quarter actually “understate the interest in the product,” he said. Elon also announced an upcoming upgrade for the Model S, X, and 3 that will improve comfort, feel and range. VP for Tech Drew Baglino adds that this upcoming updates will make Supercharging better too. 16:23 PT – Emmanuel Rosner of Deutsche Bank asks about electric pickups, particularly the Tesla Pickup Truck. He also asks about the baseline for Tesla’s baseline for orders quarter to date. Musk responds by stating that the Tesla Cybertruck is the company’s best ever, though he also mentioned that he could be wrong about this. Kirkhorn, speaking about Tesla’s baseline orders, noted that the company is focused on moving quickly as it can. “We believe everyone should be driving an electric car,” he said. Musk adds a long-term (very long) estimate of 20 million vehicles a year. Advertisement 16:20 PT – Maynard Um of Macquarie Research asks about Tesla’s software and its potential monetization opportunities, Elon reiterated the company’s intention of giving customers the most fun they can have with a car. “People spend a couple hours on average in a car. It’s a lot of time,” Musk said, adding that Tesla can look at its software for profit down the line, but for now, the company is simply focused on improving user experience. 16:16 PT – Morgan Stanley asks if vehicles produced in China could be the most profitable vehicle in Tesla’s lineup. Kirkhorn states that Tesla expects China vehicles to be in line with the cars from Fremont. The company is still working on landing the right mix for the Chinese market. “For now, it’s safe to assume that it’s in line with the margins of cars coming out of the Fremont factory,” he said. When asked if Tesla will be open to the idea of becoming a supplier of batteries and drivetrains to other OEMs, Elon Musk stated that it is in line with Tesla’s mission to help other carmakers in their EV initiatives. “It’s something we’re open to,” Musk said. 16:13 PT – Daniel Galves from Wolfe Research. He asks about the auto gross margin from Q2 to Q3, as well as potential headwinds for the Shanghai plant. CTO Kirkhorn states that Tesla is working hard to prevent ramp inefficiencies for Gigafactory 3 that it experienced in Fremont. He also explained that Tesla is working on a way to implement a “targeted” way of adjusting prices for its products. 16:08 PT – Elon Musk confirms that Gigafactory 3 Phase 2 is for battery and module production. More construction is due in Shanghai as well, as preparations for Model Y production gets underway. As for Tesla Insurance, the CTO stated that the service will be expanded to other US states, as well as some foreign territories. “The goal here is to make sure that customers have an alternative if their insurance rates are high,” Kirkhorn said. Advertisement 16:05 PT – Asked about the DeepScale acquisition and how it could help Tesla’s FSD initiative, Musk stated that the startup is a very tiny company. That being said, DeepScale has expertise in reducing the size of Neural Nets, “which is very helpful in slightly accelerating FSD,” he said. 16:00 PT – When asked if Tesla would consider selling NoA and Summon features as individual modules, Musk stated that the company will remain selling the suite as a whole. Responding to an inquiry about the Model Y’s launch and if it would interfere with Model 3 production, Musk assured that the electric sedan should not be affected that much. 15:57 PT – Questions from Say are up. First up, advertising. Is word of mouth enough? Elon says it’s more than enough. “We have no plans to advertise at this time,” he says. Tesla may do advertising in the future, but they will be more informative in nature. When asked about Tesla Energy, Musk stated that he expects the business to be even bigger than the company’s automotive business. “Tesla Energy is the least appreciated element (of Tesla). For about 18 months, almost 2 years, we had to divert a tremendous amount of resources for the Model 3 production ramp,” Musk said, explaining that Tesla Energy’s resources paid the price for the electric sedan’s challenges. Now that Model 3 is humming along, Tesla solar and storage could see “crazy growth” in the future. 15:53 PT – Kunal Girotra, Energy Operations, discusses the improvements in Tesla’s energy business, which has seen a rise in recent months. “If it doesn’t print money, we’ll fix it or take it back,” Musk confidently said, referring to the company’s revived solar business. He also mentions how homes’ value increases if they are equipped with clean energy equipment such as solar panels. Advertisement Girotra also mentions that Tesla is able to offer low solar prices because it doesn’t do advertising, lowering the company’s costs of acquisition. An enthusiastic Elon Musk adds more details, interrupting Kunal. This is not annoyed Elon though — rather, the CEO in this call is more like a very excited Musk. 15:47 PT – CFO Zachary Kirkhorn takes the stage. He explains how Tesla achieved GAAP profitability. Model S and X ASPs increased, Model 3 ASPs declined slightly, the CFO noted. “With the release of Smart Summon, we were able to recognize $30 million of deferred revenue,” Kirkhorn added, emphasizing Tesla’s strong positive free cash flow in the third quarter. Kirkhorn emphasizes that despite increases to production backlogs, orders continue to grow for the company’s electric cars. Demand is strong. The no-demand narrative is dead, and Tesla is stepping on its carcass at this point. The CFO also pledges to further reduce costs. 15:43 PT – Early access release of a “feature complete” version of Full Self-Driving is expected to be rolled out by the end of the year, says Musk. He adds that Tesla is focused on opening more Gigafactories in several countries. Lastly, Tesla is also releasing Solar Roof Version 3, which is “finally ready for the big time.” Official product launch of Solar Roof Version 3 will be done tomorrow. 15:40 PT – CEO Elon Musk thanks the Tesla team for pushing hard to achieve GAAP profitability. “Operating costs are at their lowest levels since Model 3 production started,” Musk said. He also mentions that Gigafactory 3 is already conducting Model 3 production activities. Equipment in Gigafactory 3 was installed while the factory shell was still under construction. Advertisement Gigafactory 4 will be announced by the end of 2019. Tesla is “confident” that Model Y could enter production in Summer 2020. “Model Y will outsell S, X, and 3 combined.” Musk also mentions V10, which includes the first version of Smart Summon. “There’s now been a million uses of Smart Summon.” A new version of Smart Summon is set to be released soon, taking the learnings that were gathered from the feature’s initial release. 15:35 PT – And so it begins. Senior Director of Investor Relations Martin Viecha takes the stage. He provides an overview of the topics that the earnings call will cover. Hands over the stage to Elon Musk. 15:31 PT – The earnings call should start any moment now. That being said, it’s understandable if Tesla is taking its time. Unlike the previous quarters, the company is coming to this call not to explain a loss, but to highlight a victory. 15:26 PT – It’s now just a few minutes before the Q3 2019 earnings call is expected to begin. This is a very exciting time for Tesla.

Published 13 hours ago on April 29, 2025 By Simon Alvarez (Credit: Tesla) Tesla Board member and Airbnb Co-Founder Joe Gebbia has loaded up on TSLA stock ( NASDAQ:TSLA ). The Board member’s purchase comes just over a month before Tesla is expected to launch an initial robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. Tesla CEO Elon Musk gave a nod of appreciation for the Tesla Board member in a post on social media. The TSLA Purchase As could be seen in a Form 4 submitted to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, Gebbia purchased about $1.02 million worth of TSLA stock. This was comprised of 4,000 TSLA shares at an average price of $256.308 per share. Interestingly enough, Gebbia’s purchase represents the first time an insider has purchased TSLA stock in about five years. CEO Elon Musk, in response to a post on social media platform X about the Tesla Board member’s TSLA purchase, gave a nod of appreciation for Gebbia. “Joe rocks,” Musk wrote in his post on X. Gebbia has served on Tesla’s Board as an independent director since 2022, and he is also a known friend of Elon Musk. He even joined the Trump Administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to help the government optimize its processes. Advertisement Just a Few Weeks Before Robotaxi The timing of Gebbia’s TSLA stock purchase is quite interesting as the company is expected to launch a dedicated roboatxi service this June in Austin. A recent report from Insider , citing sources reportedly familiar with the matter, claimed that Tesla currently has 300 test operators driving robotaxis around Austin city streets. The publication’s sources also noted that Tesla has an internal deadline of June 1 for the robotaxi service’s rollout, but even a launch near the end of the month would be impressive. During the Q1 2025 earnings call, Elon Musk explained that the robotaxi service that would be launched in June will feature autonomous rides in Model Y units. He also noted that the robotaxi service would see an expansion to other cities by the end of 2025. “The Teslas that will be fully autonomous in June in Austin are probably Model Ys. So, that is currently on track to be able to do paid rides fully autonomously in Austin in June and then to be in many other cities in the US by the end of this year,” Musk stated. Continue Reading Investor's Corner Tesla hints at ‘Model 2’ & next-gen EV designs Tesla’s Q1 2025 update confirms new models this year, with production tied to existing factory lines. Could it be time for the Model 2 debut? Published 5 days ago on April 24, 2025 By Maria Merano (Credit: Tesla) During its Q1 2025 earnings call, Tesla executives hinted at the much-rumored “Model 2” and other next-gen EV designs. Tesla slightly addressed whether or not it will be pushing forward with the debut of new models later this year in its latest earnings call. The company’s product development executive, Lars Moravy, shared some details about Tesla’s design process and the upcoming affordable models. “We’re still planning to release models this year. As with all launches, we’re working through, like, the last minute issues that pop up. We’re knocking them down one by one. At this point, I would say that the ramp might be a little slower than we had hoped initially…But there’s nothing that’s blocking us from starting production within the next, within the timeline laid out in the opening remarks. “And I will say it’s important to emphasize that, as we’ve said all along, the full utilization of our factories is the primary goal for these new products. And so the flexibility of what we can do within the form factor and, you know, the design of it is really limited to what we can do on our existing lines rather than building new ones. But we’ve been targeting the low cost of ownership. Monthly payment is the biggest differentiator for our vehicles, and that’s why we’re focused on bringing these new models with the, you know, the lowest price, to the market, within the constraints I just highlighted.” The Model 3 is a hell of a deal, ngl. With the federal tax credit, it'd be silly to get a comparably priced combustion-powered car. Now for the big question. Is the Model 3 currently the best-looking Tesla? https://t.co/5E37J9OKhU — TESLARATI (@Teslarati) April 24, 2025 Advertisement In January, Tesla’s Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja teased several new product introductions for this year . There is at least one product that most Tesla supporters and investors are hoping to see: the company’s affordable vehicles, which have been dubbed by the EV community as the “Model 2” or “Model Q.” Before Tesla’s Robotaxi event last year, many speculated that the company would also unveil its affordable next-gen vehicle. Gene Munster from Deepwater had expected Tesla to release a stripped-down version of the Model 3 as its affordable vehicle during the Robotaxi event. In the end, Tesla unveiled its Robotaxi vehicle and its Robovan design. It’s been a while since the Robotaxi event, and Tesla has kept mum about its affordable vehicle. Considering its Q1 2025 performance, TSLA investors look forward to catalysts that could boost the stock. The “Model 2” has been labeled a potential catalyst for Tesla . As such, TSLA investors and supporters have been itching for news about the new affordable vehicle. The main questions surrounding the “Model 2” revolve around its design and price. Based on Moravy’s statement, the “Model 2’s” design will heavily depend on Tesla’s current assembly lines and supply chain structures.

Published 6 days ago on April 24, 2025 By Maria Merano (Credit: Tesla) Tesla gained Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter’s confidence following its Q1 2025 earnings call. Piper Sandler reaffirmed its Overweight rating and $400 TSLA price target, signaling optimism for the company’s robotaxi and affordable vehicle launches expected this year. The firm’s stance reflects Tesla’s resilience amid market challenges. Despite expectations of weak Q1 financials, Tesla’s stock edged up in after-hours trading, defying skepticism. Piper Sandler’s Alexander Potter noted that the results met the hopes of Tesla supporters, particularly as the company held firm on its timelines. Potter emphasized that anticipation for robotaxi details and new vehicle launches should keep critics at bay, supporting the $400 target. “In our preview last week, we predicted that (at best) Q1 would be a non-event. With the stock trading up slightly in the after-hours session, it appears our best-case scenario has materialized. Considering generally weak Q1 financials, we think this is the best result that TSLA bulls could’ve reasonably hoped for. “In our view, the most important Q1 takeaway is this: Tesla didn’t hedge expectations re: launching Robotaxis or lower-priced vehicles in 1H25. With <2 months until the end of June, investors can look forward to some interesting catalysts in the weeks ahead. In our view, this alone should be enough to keep the bears at bay, at least until we have a better idea re: the details of Tesla’s new products, as well as the scale/scope of the Robotaxi launch,” wrote Potter. Advertisement Tesla provides details on the impact of Trump’s auto tariff Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives, a longtime TSLA bull, echoed Potter’s optimism for Tesla. Ives raised his price target for Tesla stock from $315 to $350 with a BUY rating. His Tesla upgrade came after Elon Musk’s announcement during the Q1 earnings call that he would reduce his involvement with DOGE, signaling a sharper focus on Tesla. Tesla’s steady Q1 performance and unwavering commitment to its 2025 roadmap, including the Robotaxi launch and lower-priced models, bolster investor confidence. Piper Sandler’s analysis underscores Tesla’s ability to navigate a competitive electric vehicle market while advancing its technological edge. The upcoming Robotaxi launch and affordable vehicle introductions are pivotal, with analysts expecting these initiatives to drive stock value through 2025. As Tesla prepares for these milestones, its stock movement reflects market trust in Musk’s vision. With Piper Sandler and Wedbush reaffirming bullish outlooks, Tesla’s strategic moves will remain under close scrutiny, positioning the company to capitalize on its innovation pipeline in a dynamic industry landscape.
