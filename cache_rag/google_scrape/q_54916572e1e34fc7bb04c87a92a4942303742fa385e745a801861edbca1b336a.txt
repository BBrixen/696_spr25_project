The game will actually be the eighth in the series and serves as a bit of a reboot due to a fundamental change in setting and gameplay. However, because it takes place after the events of God of War III, it is referred to as God of War 4. The new God of War game has already received rave reviews, with critics praising the game’s approach to the narrative and protagonist. ‘The new God of War offers the satisfyingly kinetic combat and the absurd sense of enemy scale that made the series so beloved, but it fuses it to a much more complete game,’ wrote The Verge ’s Andrew Webster. The new God of War game moves the narrative away from Greek mythology to the Norse gods One of the talking points about the game was its gameplay, which is meant to vastly differ from God of War III or God of War: Ascension. "The main thing we're doing is we're reimagining the gameplay, kind of tearing it down, rebuilding it from scratch, and continuing the storyline,’ Cory Barlog, creative director at Sony Interactive Entertainment told YouTube Live at E3. ‘We're carrying the mythology we've created with God of War and bringing it into Norse mythology.’ Despite Ascension featuring a mutliplayer feature, God of War 2018 will be single player only. Here is all the information on the 2018 God of War game including when it’s going to be released, its plot and how to pre-order it. God of War 2018 release date God of War will be released on Friday April 20, 2018 in both digital and physical formats. Given that Sony Interactive Entertainment is the game’s developer, God of War will be released exclusively on Playstation 4.

God of War plot The new God of War game takes place some time after the events of God of War III. Having brought down the gods of Olympus at the end of the original trilogy, a now older and seemingly calmer Kratos finds himself in the world of Norse mythology. He has a young son, Atreus, whom he must teach to survive in a new and unpredictable world. "We do not fight because the world makes us fight. We fight for a greater purpose."

The trailer shows main character Kratos and his son Atreus and previews their journey ahead into the unknown.
