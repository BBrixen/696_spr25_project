Jalen is currently a linebacker for the @Lions and was a member of our Executive Committee for the past two seasons. pic.twitter.com/eZfcTj56L5 â€” NFLPA (@NFLPA) March 8, 2024 Reeves-Maybin ascends to the top chair of the NFLPA after spending the last two years on its executive committee, replacing former Packers and Browns center JC Tretter , who earned a second term in March 2022 despite concluding his playing career at the end of the 2021 season. Reeves-Maybin will take on the increased responsibilities of serving as the face of the league's players while working alongside executive director Lloyd Howell, who replaced DeMaurice Smith in June 2023 . Reeves-Maybin has flourished in the last 12 months, returning to the team that drafted him and earning his first Pro Bowl nod (and a second-team All-Pro selection) as a key special teamer for a Lions team that won its first division title in 30 years and reached the NFC Championship Game. His efforts earned him a contract extension through the 2025 season, which Reeves-Maybin signed last week. Now, he's blossoming into an even greater leader, an individual in whom the rest of the NFL's players have given their vote of confidence.
