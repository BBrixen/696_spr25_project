They acknowledge several different recipients, have runners-up, and have third place. Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.

The film's latest release was in Croatia on 9 September 2021. [ 4 ] ^ Attributed to multiple sources: [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] ^ Parasite was Bong's second selection for the award, after Mother in 2009. [ 6 ] ^ Although Parasite was the first film with a non-English script to win Best Picture at the Oscars, it is not to be confused with the first foreign film (produced by a company of a country that does not have English as its primary language) to win Best Picture, which was achieved by The Artist in 2012. The French-produced film was largely silent with French intertitles and contained a few spoken lines in English. [ 20 ] The Academy dictates foreign language as the main qualification for international film, hence The Artist did not qualify. [ 21 ] Moreover, while prior winners The Last Emperor and Slumdog Millionaire include significant amounts of non-English dialogue, they were considered domestic productions. [ 22 ] ^ a b Tied with Sam Mendes for 1917 ^ The AFI Special Award gives recognition to media that falls outside the American Film Institute 's eligibility criteria, such as non-American productions. [ 25 ] ^ Tied with Atlantics ^ Also awarded to Fleabag ^ Tied with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood ^ Tied with Ísold Uggadóttir for And Breathe Normally ^ The ceremony was supposed to be held on 14 March 2020, but was indefinitely cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic . [ 90 ] ^ Jointly held by Fanny and Alexander ( 56th Academy Awards ), Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ( 73rd Academy Awards ), Parasite ( 92nd Academy Awards ). [ 100 ] This record was also tied by All Quiet on the Western Front at the 95th Academy Awards . [ 101 ] ^ a b This award does not have a single winner, but recognizes multiple films. ^ Tied with Wesley Snipes for Dolemite Is My Name ^ Also awarded to 1917 ^ Tied with Noah Baumbach for Marriage Story References [ edit ] ^ a b Mumford, Gwilym (25 May 2019).
