The Godfather What to Know Critics Consensus One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema. Read Critics Reviews Critics Reviews View All (153) Critics Reviews Tom Huddleston Time Out This is not only grand entertainment, but an emotional and intellectual experience to rival any in cinema. Rated: 5/5 Dec 12, 2024 Full Review Wendy Ide Times (UK) This magnificent multigenerational mafia drama represents a benchmark not just in crime movies but in American cinema as a whole. Aug 16, 2023 Full Review Steven D. Greydanus Catholic World Report Now half a century old, Francis Ford Coppola's revered New Hollywood masterpiece has one of the best-known final shots in film history - but it almost had a much more Catholic ending. Apr 8, 2022 Full Review Marcelo Paredes Cinencuentro While the concept of "auteur cinema" had been circulating for years, it is with this film that it is definitively consolidated, marking the beginning of a new way of making films. [Full review in Spanish] Apr 23, 2025 Full Review Megan Fisher Loud and Clear Reviews Coppola was able to take a trashy pulp novel and turn it into something close to Shakespeare; a sweeping, epic tale of family, crime, corruption and the Immigrant experience in America. Jan 11, 2025 Full Review Ben Gibbons Screen Rant The Godfather remains a powerful film that explores intricate themes that appear to contradict, but Coppola's storytelling ties it together. Rated: 9/10 Nov 27, 2024 Full Review Read all reviews Audience Reviews View All (1000+) audience reviews Thomas V it insists upon itself Rated 5/5 Stars • Rated 5 out of 5 stars 03/25/25 Full Review Tom C A classic, of course 5 stars. Rated 5/5 Stars • Rated 5 out of 5 stars 07/01/24 Full Review Arlene B It was so worth seeing The Godfather on the big screen.  Obviously, this is a 5 Star movie. If you have never seen it, or it has been years since you have seen it, if it is ever playing in a theater near you, you should definitely see it in a theater.  I was hoping to see that The Godfather Part 2 would also be shown in theaters, but so far it doesn't look like it is on the schedule.
