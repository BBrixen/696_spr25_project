We explore how the total purse on offer has changed through the decades. 1860-1862: No prize money Not a single penny was on offer at the first three editions of The Open, with Willie Park Snr’s victory in 1860 and Old Tom Morris’ back-to-back triumphs in 1861 and 1862 rewarded only with possession of the Challenge Belt. Park and Morris may not have benefited financially from their early successes at The Open, but both men undoubtedly hold a special place in the annals of golfing history. 1863 – Total purse: £10 When Park triumphed for a second time in 1863, a pot of £10 was shared equally among the eight professionals in a 14-man field. 1864 – Total purse: £15 While the previous year offered up money for the first time, a first-prize incentive was first given out at The 5th Open in 1864, where Old Tom Morris earned £6 with his victory, 40% of the £15 total pot. 1893 – Total purse: £100 The prize fund fluctuated significantly throughout the 1870s and 1880s, twice rising up towards £50 only to then dip back down to as little as £20 in future years. However, the 1890s saw a lasting rise and exactly £100 was on offer for seven Opens in succession from 1893. A total of £125 was then available at every Open in the following decade, with £50 going to the Champion each year at the start of the 20th century. 1931 – Total purse: £500 Tommy Armour, the Champion Golfer of 1931 When Tommy Armour won at Carnoustie in 1931, the total prize fund had reached £500 for the first time, with £100 going to the Champion Golfer. This would remain the case at every Open up to and including the Championship of 1939. 1946 – Total purse: £1,000 The first Open after World War II offered £1,000 in prize money, double the amount that had been on offer in each of the nine previous Championships. 1965 – Total purse: £10,000 By the mid-1960s, a revitalised Championship boosted by the success of Arnold Palmer was starting to see its purse increase at a faster rate. Peter Thomson received £1,750 for his fifth Open win in 1965, more than twice as much as he earned when first lifting the Claret Jug in 1954. 1977 – Total purse: £100,000 The Open of 1977 is widely regarded as one of the finest Championships in history, thanks to the iconic Duel in the Sun between Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus . It was also the first Championship to offer a six-figure purse, with Watson winning £10,000 through his victory.. 1993 – Total purse: £1,000,000 By the time Greg Norman claimed his second Open win at Royal St George’s in 1993, the Championship had a £1million prize pool. Norman’s share of that kitty was £100,000. 2011 – Total purse: £5,000,000 The title of Champion Golfer was ever more lucrative when Darren Clarke emerged victorious at Sandwich in 2011. A total purse of £5,000,000 represented a five-fold increase on 1993, but the Champion’s prize had been multiplied by nine, meaning Clarke picked up £900,000 along with the Gold Medal and the Claret Jug. 2017 – Total purse: $10,250,000 Jordan Spieth receives the Claret Jug at Royal Birkdale The 146th Open at Royal Birkdale saw the prize fund displayed in US dollars rather than pounds sterling for the first time. A purse of just over $10m – equivalent to approximately £7.8m – represented a substantial increase on the money available at the previous year’s Championship at Royal Troon. 2023 – Total purse: $16,500,000 A total of $16.5m was shared among the participants in The 151st Open, with Champion Golfer of the Year Brian Harman receiving $3,000,000. Harman's prize money represented a 50% increase since 2021, when Collin Morikawa picked up $2,000,000 at Royal St George's.
