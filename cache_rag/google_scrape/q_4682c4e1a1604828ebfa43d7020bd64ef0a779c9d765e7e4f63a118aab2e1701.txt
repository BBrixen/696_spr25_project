[ 2 ] The name means "super-skilled player" in Arabic, [ 3 ] and is a representation of the popular men's headdress keffiyeh , used in many parts of the Arab world . [ 4 ] He [ 5 ] was designed by Indian firm Fractal Picture, and animated by Qatari firm Katara Studios. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Creation and design [ edit ] La'eeb is an anthropomorphic keffiyeh that floats and has eyes, lips, and an open mouth, and is presented as a joyful character that loves to help everyone. [ 8 ] Khalid Ali Al Mawlawi, Deputy Director General, Marketing, Communications and Tournament Experience, stated “We are sure fans everywhere will love this fun and playful character. La’eeb will play a vital role as we engage fans young and old in Qatar’s FIFA World Cup experience.” [ 9 ] La'eeb is presented to be adventurous, fun and curious, and encourages everyone to believe in themselves. [ 10 ] La'eeb was revealed to the public through a short film produced by Fractal Picture and co-created by Katara Studios, "A Visit from Mascot Verse". [ 6 ] [ 7 ] He was named the first 'digitised' mascot, [ 11 ] from the 'mascot verse', "a place that is indescribable. We encourage everyone to imagine what it looks like" - which is open to interpretation. [ 9 ] A water screen projection film created by Fractal Picture in collaboration with La'eeb was exhibited on the corniche of Qatar. Additionally, they produced a 3D LED digital billboard film that was displayed in Lusail. [ 12 ] Public reception [ edit ] La'eeb has faced criticism for its ghostly appearance, which some have linked to the deaths of guest workers on World Cup construction sites. While some fans appreciate the mascot's reference to regional culture , others argue that it lacks a connection to football. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Twitter users were particularly vocal in their opinions of La'eeb, with many likening the mascot to a ghost or jinn , and some even referring to it as a "tissue paper" figure. Despite the criticism, there were also those who defended La'eeb's design and praised its cultural significance.
