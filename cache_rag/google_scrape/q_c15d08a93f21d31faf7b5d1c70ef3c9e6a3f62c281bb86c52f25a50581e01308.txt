Uruguay and Argentina contested in what was a rematch of the gold medal match of the 1928 Olympics , which Uruguay won after a replay . The final was played at the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo , Uruguay, on 30 July, a Wednesday. It was one of only two World Cup finals to be played on a day other than Sunday, the other being the 1966 FIFA World Cup final , which was played on a Saturday. A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as which team would provide the match ball. FIFA intervened with a compromise, that Argentina would provide the ball for the first half, and Uruguay for the second. [ 1 ] The stadium gates were opened at eight in the morning, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full, [ 2 ] [ full citation needed ] officially holding 93,000 people. [ 3 ] Uruguay successfully "defended" its Olympic gold medal achievement 4–2, coming back from a 2–1 deficit at half-time. Uruguay manager Alberto Suppici was 31 at the time, and still holds the record for being youngest coach of a FIFA World Cup winning team. Jules Rimet , president of FIFA, presented Uruguay with the World Cup Trophy , later to be named after him. The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay. [ 3 ] In Buenos Aires , a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate. [ 4 ] [ full citation needed ] The last living player from the final was Argentine striker Francisco Varallo , who died on 30 August 2010 aged 100. [ 5 ] The last living Uruguayan from the final was Ernesto Mascheroni , who died on 3 July 1984 aged 76.
