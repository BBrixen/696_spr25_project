LSU’s Jayden Daniels, now with the Washington Redskins, was the 2023 Walter Camp Player of Year. “We are proud to continue the great work of Walter Camp and recognize the best college football players in the nation,” Foundation president John Barbarotta said. “This watch list is a great start to what is shaping up to be another exciting year of college football.” Earlier in the summer, the Foundation announced its 2024 preseason All-American teams .  Walter Camp is the nation’s oldest and most prestigious collegiate football All-America team. The 2024 Player of Year watch list will be narrowed to 10 semi-finalists in early November and three finalists will be announced on November 26.  The 2024 Walter Camp Player of the Year recipient, which is voted on by the 133 NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision head coaches and sports information directors, will be announced on ESPN’s College Football Awards Show on December 12.

Founded in 1997, the NCFAA includes college football’s most prestigious awards and its 24 awards have honored more than 900 recipients dating back to 1935.
