Members Online • cornpenguin01 Man, I know Mario Odyssey is older, but I’ve been playing it for the first time and it’s wonderful Discussion So some context is that I bought my switch just last year and have been playing a bunch of the essentials. BotW of course being one of them. I’d seen gameplay of both back in 2017 and for some reason had this thought that Mario Odyssey was overhyped compared to BotW. I thought there was no way it should be as highly rated as that or even Mario Galaxy 2. So then it came on sale for less than $40 last week at Walmart. I picked it up on a whim even though I wanted 3D world more. Man I want to slap old me. This game is so much fun. Every single minute is perfectly crafted to make me have as much fun as possible. The worlds are incredible creative and Mario feels so good to control. I’m currently in Bowser’s Castle, but I love how each world changes drastically depending on how much progress you have in it. Overall, fan-fucking-tastic game I recommend to anyone who somehow hasn’t picked it up yet. After this, I’ll play 3D world and then begin praying to the gods for a new 3D mario.
