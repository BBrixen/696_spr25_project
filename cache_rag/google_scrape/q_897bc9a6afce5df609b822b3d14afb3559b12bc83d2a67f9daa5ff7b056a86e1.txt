Infantino's remarks FIFA president Gianni Infantino highlighted the following, noting a target of $250 million in solidarity for club soccer across the world. “The distribution model of the FIFA Club World Cup reflects the pinnacle of club football and represents the biggest-ever prize money for a football tournament comprising a seven-match group stage and playoff format with a potential payout of USD 125 million foreseen for the winners. “In addition to the prize money for the participating teams, there is an unprecedented solidarity investment programme where we have a target of an additional 250 million dollars being provided to club football across the world. This solidarity will undoubtedly provide a significant boost in our ongoing efforts in making football truly global. “Not only that, but FIFA will neither retain any funding for this tournament, as all revenues will be distributed to club football, nor will it touch FIFA’s reserves, which are set aside for global football development through the 211 FIFA Member Associations.” MLSsoccer staff - @mls FIFA Club World Cup Inter Miami CF Seattle Sounders FC League News Copy URL Share on Facebook Share on X Related Stories Real Salt Lake midfielder Diego Luna's red card rescinded LAFC coach Steve Cherundolo to step down after 2025 season Miller Sports + Entertainment purchases controlling interest in Real Salt Lake More News More News Vancouver Whitecaps on verge of Concacaf Champions Cup final: "We're close" Disciplinary Committee Decision LA Galaxy's Joseph Paintsil fined by MLS Disciplinary Committee National Writer: Charles Boehm Inter Miami chase Concacaf Champions Cup comeback: "Nothing is impossible" Power Rankings: Philadelphia Union gain steam, San Diego FC stumble Deadline Day: Which clubs made the biggest moves?
