(AP Photo/Petr David Josek) Petr David Josek/Associated Press World Football Germany Becomes 1st European Team to Win World Cup in Americas Bleacher Report Milestones Jun 8, 2018 With Sunday's 1-0 defeat of Argentina in the World Cup final, Germany became the first-ever European team to win a World Cup title in the Americas, per ESPN Stats & Info . Nine of the 10 Cups held in Europe have been won by European sides, while each of the seven tournaments held in the western hemisphere had featured a South American winner, until Germany broke the streak on chance No. 8. Brazil are the only non-European side with a title in Europe, having memorably dismantled the Swedish hosts by a score of 5-2 at the 1958 World Cup final in Solna, Sweden.

Brazil took home the trophy in 2002 before Spain captured Europe's first World Cup title outside the continent in 2010. Since Brazil's victory in '02, Europe has gone on an unprecedented run of dominance, becoming the first continent to capture three consecutive World Cups, per ESPN's Paul Carr . Europe has now captured five of the last seven world titles, taking an 11-9 advantage over South America on the all-time continental ledger. Of course, much to the chagrin of the rest of the world, no team from Africa, North America, Asia or Oceania has so much as played in a World Cup final. Even in South America, the success has been extremely concentrated, with Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay the only teams from the western hemisphere to compete in a World Cup final. 01:30 UCL Semifinals are Here ü§© TOP NEWS Top 5Ô∏è‚É£ Liverpool MVPs Bleacher Report 2d Post-Draft NFL Power Rankings Bleacher Report 14h NFL Draft Picks We Wanted to See üëÄ Bleacher Report 14h Latest Projections and Pro Comps ‚úçÔ∏è Bleacher Report 14h Ranking Top 10 Free Agents Post-Draft Bleacher Report 14h TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d 2026 NFL Mock Draft: B/R's Way-Too-Early Predictions Eagles land CB Avieon Terrell Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 11h Russini Says She Never Got Intel Browns Ranked Shedeur Sanders High on Draft Board Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d WWE Raw Results, Winners, Live Grades, Reaction, Highlights from April 28 ‚öîÔ∏è Jey, Logan Paul on collision course  üçø Ripley and Perez put on a show üì≤ Tap for full results and analysis Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 12h Shedeur Sanders Reportedly Was Top QB on Giants' Board After Cam Ward Ahead of Draft Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d 1 Trade Every NBA Playoff Team Wishes It Could Make Right Now TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d 2026 NFL Mock Draft: B/R's Way-Too-Early Predictions Eagles land CB Avieon Terrell Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 11h Russini Says She Never Got Intel Browns Ranked Shedeur Sanders High on Draft Board Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d WWE Raw Results, Winners, Live Grades, Reaction, Highlights from April 28 ‚öîÔ∏è Jey, Logan Paul on collision course  üçø Ripley and Perez put on a show üì≤ Tap for full results and analysis Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 12h Shedeur Sanders Reportedly Was Top QB on Giants' Board After Cam Ward Ahead of Draft Bleacher Report ‚Ä¢ 1d 1 Trade Every NBA Playoff Team Wishes It Could Make Right Now Bleacher Report About Advertise Contact Us Get Help Careers Sitemap Community Guidelines Privacy Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information Terms Of Use AdChoices B/R Sports on MAX B/R Creators Program Copyright ¬© 2025 Bleacher Report, Inc.
