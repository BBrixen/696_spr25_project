[ 2 ] Work on Phantom Liberty began with discussions of what's next for Cyberpunk 2077 , about a month prior to the game's release. As of October 3rd, 2023, Phantom Liberty has sold over 3 million copies. [ 6 ] As of November 27, 2024, Phantom Liberty has sold over 8 million copies. [ 7 ] Trivia [ ] The events of Phantom Liberty are heavily inspired by the Escape from New York movie by director and writer John Carpenter . Other inspirations include the book Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad , and the film Apocalypse Now by Francis Coppola , which is loosely based on the book. [ 8 ] In the final act of the game, while riding an elevator down to the final area, Johnny states, "We're heading down the Heart of Darkness", likely in reference to the book.
