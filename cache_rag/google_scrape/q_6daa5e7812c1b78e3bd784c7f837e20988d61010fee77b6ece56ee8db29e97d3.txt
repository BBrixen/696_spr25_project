[ 10 ] Janković's strong start to the year meant that some considered her a title threat at the Australian Open ; however, she was eliminated in the fourth round by the eventual champion Serena Williams, who was ranked 81st in the world at the time.

It was the first time since 2010 that Janković made the second week and won consecutive matches at Wimbledon; her performance also made 2015 the first year since 2007 that Janković won more than five grass court matches. After losing in the first round of the Istanbul Open to Urszula Radwańska, Janković won the WTA 125 title in Nanchang by defeating Chang Kai-chen . She did not drop a set throughout the tournament. This tournament revitalized her career and opened her path to a successful Chinese hard court season, right after the second round of the Rogers Cup and an excellent semifinal in Cincinnati after beating Madison Keys and eighth-seeded Karolína Plíšková en route. Janković then suffered a shocking loss to wildcard Océane Dodin in the first round of the US Open .

For the first time since 2001, she was unranked in the WTA singles rankings. 2022: Retirement [ edit ] Janković did not participate in any WTA tournaments prior to the suspension of the tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

[ 93 ] [ 94 ] Rivalries [ edit ] Janković vs. Ivanovic [ edit ] Main article: Ivanovic–Janković rivalry A prominent rivalry in women's tennis was the one between Janković and fellow Fed Cup teammate and Serbian compatriot Ana Ivanovic . [ 95 ] They have met 12 times, with Ivanovic leading 9–3 overall. [ 96 ] Seven of their eleven meetings have come at important stages of tournaments, while two have come at Grand Slam tournaments; Janković trails in both categories 1–6 and 0–2 respectively. Both players were touted as future top players following their breakthrough in 2007 and 2008 , however, both have since underperformed on the WTA Tour and dropped out of the Top 10 in contrasting circumstances. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] Matches between Janković and Ivanovic are often given the nickname "The Battle of Serbia". [ 99 ] [ 100 ] Since the end of 2008, both have struggled at the Grand Slams, with Janković only being able to reach the semi-finals of the 2010 French Open and the quarter-finals of the 2013 French Open and Ivanovic the quarter-finals of the 2012 US Open and 2014 Australian Open , and the semi-finals of the 2015 French Open . [ citation needed ] Their most important meeting to date was in the semifinals of the 2008 French Open ; the match was one of historic proportions as it would decide which of the two would become the first Serbian player, male or female, to gain the world No. 1 ranking. [ 101 ] In a match that lasted three sets and saw one player try to gain authority over the other, Ivanovic prevailed; the result saw Ivanovic claim the world No. 1 ranking for the first time, however Janković would herself claim the ranking later that year. The pair were involved in a long-running feud in early 2010, arising from Ivanovic's decision not to play in Serbia's Fed Cup World Group play-off against Slovakia due to her poor form at the time. [ 102 ] They met in a controversial encounter at the Madrid Premier Mandatory tournament in May that year, in which Janković appeared to criticise and imitate Ivanovic's fist-pumping habit following a three-set victory. [ 103 ] It was only Janković's third (and most recent to date) victory against Ivanovic, after previously winning in 2006 and 2008. At Indian Wells in 2011, Janković was the defending champion, but Ivanovic defeated her in the fourth round, ending her title defence. [ 104 ] That would be their last meeting in a WTA Tour match until the 2013 Australian Open , where Ivanovic prevailed in the third round. [ 32 ] Their most recent meeting was in the semi-finals of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in 2014 with Janković losing again in straight sets.

The third match in this streak was the final of the Kremlin Cup , which was the third consecutive title won by Janković in a stretch which also included titles in Beijing and Stuttgart . [ 115 ] Janković had defeated Zvonareva on her way to the two titles which preceded the Kremlin Cup. However, Zvonareva would defeat Janković at the WTA Tour Championships later that year; this would be the start of an ongoing five-match winning streak against Janković. Their only meeting at a Grand Slam tournament was at Wimbledon in 2010 , in the tournament's fourth round. Zvonareva won, reaching her first quarter-finals of the grass court Major (and eventually went on to reach the final), after Janković retired whilst trailing in the second set. [ 116 ] Their most recent meeting was at the Qatar Ladies Open in 2011 with Zvonareva winning in three sets. It was her fifth straight victory over Janković, dating back to 2008.

They played again in the final, and again in USA – at the US Open in 2008 . Serena won in two sets. In the second set Janković had 5–3 and three consecutive set points on Serena serve. Later, when she was serving for the set at 5–4, she missed one more set point. However, Serena saved all set points and won four games in a row for US Open title. [ citation needed ] Two years later, in the semifinal of the 2010 Internazionali BNL d'Italia Janković won in three sets, saving match point in doing so and coming back from 5–2 down in the final set tie-break. In the quarter-final she had defeated Venus Williams, becoming the only woman to defeat both of the Williams sisters in a 24-hour period. Their opening round match at the Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics was their first and only match on grass. Janković wasn't seeded and Serena won in two sets before going on to win the gold medal. [ citation needed ] At the final of the 2013 Family Circle Cup , Charleston, Serena won in three sets. Again in 2013, at China Open , they met in the final and Serena won in two sets.

[ citation needed ] Their most recent meeting occurred in the quarterfinal of the 2014 Western & Southern Open , where Serena won in straight sets. Serena improved to 6–0 record since it was 4–4. [ citation needed ] Janković vs. Justine Henin [ edit ] Jelena Janković and Justine Henin met ten times over a span of six years with Henin prevailing each time. They never met on carpet or grass. Five of their matches were on clay and five on hard courts. Six of their matches went three sets. The majority (7) of their matches occurred during the 2007 season. They met twice in Grand Slams (2006 U.S. Open semifinals, 2007 French Open semifinals) as well as the round-robin stage of the 2007 tour championships. Despite their lopsided head-to-head results, their matches were always highly competitive. List of all matches No. Year Tournament Surface Round Winner Score Length J.J.

Henin 3–6, 7–6 2 , 6–3 0 10 Playing style [ edit ] Jelena Janković is a defensive baseliner, and is often regarded as a counterpuncher . Janković is known for being able to slide effectively on all surfaces. Janković has very consistent groundstrokes and prefers to go down the line more often than crosscourt. Her biggest weapon is her two-handed backhand , especially down the line. [ 121 ] She also has a solid forehand , although she typically hits fewer winners off that side as she can have trouble hitting through the ball on that wing. Her net game has improved as a result of additional doubles play, meaning that she is now able to hit effective drive, drop, and swinging volleys. Her main weakness early on in her career was her serve. She would typically spin it in on the first and second serve which can lead to her getting broken many times in matches. After 2008, her serve became more reliable and aggressive. Her weakest surface is considered grass and her best surface is fast hard courts, where she can use her defensive skills and speed to win matches. However, given the fact that six of her fifteen titles have come on clay, this could also be considered her best surface.  One of the most high-profile achievements of her career occurred on grass in the third round of the 2015 Wimbledon Championships , when she defeated Petra Kvitová, the defending champion, a two-time Wimbledon title holder, then-no. 2 in the world (when Janković had dropped to world no. 30), and the only player who had defeated Serena Williams that year.  Janković's ups and downs are often caused by her fragile mindset (see US Open 2006 vs Henin), and they have resulted in her being nicknamed 'Queen Chaos.' [ citation needed ] [ 122 ] Personal life [ edit ] Janković was the subject of the 2008 autobiographical documentary, Jelenin svet (Jelena's World), [ 123 ] featuring Justine Henin , Svetlana Kuznetsova , Ana Ivanovic , Elena Dementieva , Anna Chakvetadze and other notable players. [ 123 ] On 5 December 2007, Janković became a UNICEF National Ambassador for Serbia , for Children's Fund. "I am happy to have become a UNICEF ambassador for Serbia. This is a great honour for me and I will try to justify the role that has been given to me", she said. Janković is the second Serbian tennis star to have volunteered to help promote the rights of children and collect funds for UNICEF after Ana Ivanovic became an ambassador in September. Janković is a cousin of Serbian singer Dijana Janković, internationally better known as Didi J. [ 124 ] On 6 April 2021, Janković gave birth to a baby girl in Belgrade, Serbia. [ 125 ] Endorsements [ edit ] Janković promoting Reebok in 2007 Janković is currently sponsored by Italian sportswear company Fila . Previously, Janković had endorsed Anta and Reebok sportswear, and had her own line with them for her tournament wear. Janković also has an endorsement with Prince Sports : in her early career until 2007, she played with the original Prince O3 Red; from 2008 to 2010 she used the Prince O3 SpeedPort Pro White; from 2011 to 2013 Janković played with different types of racquets and in 2012 and 2013 she chose blacked out ones; since January 2014 Janković has been playing with the Prince O3 Red LS.
