Read Critics Reviews Critics Reviews View All (59) Critics Reviews Zaki Hasan San Francisco Chronicle Not enough has been changed to turn around anyone who already dislikes it, but in cutting out 13 minutes of runtime, the director has excised many of the small moments that made it uniquely memorable in the first place. Mar 28, 2021 Full Review John Anderson America Magazine Much is tailored to the needs of drama in "Godfather, Coda." But one cannot manufacture urgency in a film that lacks the kind of cosmic conflict of its two predecessors. Dec 18, 2020 Full Review David Ehrlich IndieWire It's often gripping, sometimes masterful, and almost never betrays its history as the work of a wayward giant scrambling back toward respectability after a long decade lost in the wilderness. Dec 18, 2020 Full Review Marcelo Paredes Cinencuentro What it does well, it does very well, offering an alternative closure to one of cinema's most complex characters. [Full review in spanish] Apr 23, 2025 Full Review Erick Estrada Cinegarage The descent of Michael to different hells. Each one more tragic. Each one more profound. [Full review in Spanish] Nov 1, 2022 Full Review Nick Hasted The Arts Desk For all its flashy flaws, perhaps we should be grateful Coppola scrabbled so close to a legitimate last act. Rated: 4/5 Mar 14, 2022 Full Review Read all reviews Audience Reviews View All (67) audience reviews Erwin Q Part 3 is an outstanding film that grows in popularity for three reasons.  1) It has the best ending of all three Godfather films.  2) Part 3 is the best modern interpretation of Shakespeare's King Lear.  And 3) The clever use of  allegory and metaphor in Part 3 elevates the artistic merit of the story by  showing that the Coppola's became the family that Vito Corleone always wanted.  Only the best artists know how to use allegory as well as Coppola in Part 3.  Coppola uses an opera that his father conducted, Cavalleria Rusticana, with his uncle Anton seen conducting in Part 3, to show that Michael has failed to live up the the standard of rustic chivalry set by Vito.   The incestous relationship in Part 3 is a reference to the Oedipal complex of King Lear where Lear's daughters are married to men very much like their father.   Mary was attracted to Vincent because he represented the side of Michael that she was fascinated with, but not allowed to know.  That relationship is also a reference to Coppola's grandparents, who were also first cousins, but married out of compassion because the face of Coppolas Grandmother was disfigured.  Coppolas Grandfather, realizing that no men would marry her and that she might grow old alone, offered to marry her so that she could have children, knowing the biological risks.  The moral judgment to marry out of compassion became a blessing.  The Coppola descendants were not only healthy, but also hyper talented.    Coppola cast Sofia to represent both the Coppolas and the Corleones with specific instructions to not act, but be herself and preserve the realism of the dialogue based upon conversations within the Coppola family.  This highlights that the Coppolas are not criminal predators, like the Corleones.  The Coppolas are a family of artists who make positive contributions to society.  Mary dies in Part 3 from the sins of the Corleones while Sofia continues to thrive in real life by the virtues of the Coppolas.  This can also be said of Nicholas Cage and all of the Coppola children. Rated 5/5 Stars ‚Ä¢ Rated 5 out of 5 stars 04/17/25 Full Review Frank H The underrated, albeit superfluous third and final entry. A film that Coppola himself didn't want to make, but was pressured under contract by the studios after a string of box office flops by him. Even so, while it isn't as good as the first two, it's still and excellent film, and this newly edited and renamed 'Coda' version is probably the best way to see this final entry, although that it disputed. Rated 4/5 Stars ‚Ä¢ Rated 4 out of 5 stars 03/06/25 Full Review Tom R Does not hold a candle to the first two films, and at times it truly feels cringey. But this trilogy capper still has its moments. Rated 4/5 Stars ‚Ä¢ Rated 4 out of 5 stars 11/28/24 Full Review Vanesa M This movie is my favorite. I love that it sends out hidden messages. It‚Äôs really interesting, and I could watch it a thousand more times. I recommend it, but you need to have time to watch it because it‚Äôs a long movie.  It‚Äôs the best movie I‚Äôve ever seen. üëè Rated 5/5 Stars ‚Ä¢ Rated 5 out of 5 stars 11/20/24 Full Review timmy b Brings a clearer, more succinct weight to the Film, the Series & to Michael Corleone. Rated 4/5 Stars ‚Ä¢ Rated 4 out of 5 stars 11/13/24 Full Review Bryant C Not the best in the franchise but it's certainly better than other movies out there.
