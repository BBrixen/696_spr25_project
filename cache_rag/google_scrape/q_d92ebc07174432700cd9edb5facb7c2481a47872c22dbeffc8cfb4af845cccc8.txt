African countries were not doing well in the world cup and I believe in some years to come in future they will do well and any can Be the winner. Lets have hope we Africans. (Profesa Beka, June 2022) Not until African countries start selection of players based on merit and not by who can buy his place in team or by influence of some people in authority, this dream will take a long time to come true.        Africa is harvest of talents in all areas of sports, the problem is management. ( from Uyo Oghene, Nov 2022) i know and believe that Africa's time is coming to win the wordcup (Augustine Godwin Stine, 2014) When will africa nation win the world cup cos it seem very possible for any nation in africa if only they can put their house in order. chukwuemeka Nwawuba  (2013) Africa can only win the world football cup if only Africans can change their minds and remove the corrupt syndrome in their blood.

By Great Nigeria Team. Chukwudi Joseph Ikegwuonu  (2013) Why the pessimism? Nigeria has everything it takes to win this world cup and all we can do is to support her no matter how ridiculous the idea seems. Salsim  FIREphaenix  (2014) Sorry, but I suppose... after all Nigeria has won one game and tied in another. FIREphaenix  salsim  (2014) How about now? Are they still going to win? its always going to be the same teams at the Top.
