Members Online • Sungamer Did CD Projekt RED announce Cyberpunk 2077 too early? Discussion Let me first say this, I do not in any way doubt CD Project RED's capability's. But then again the internet as a whole are known to take things out of proportions. So my question is then, did they announce the game too early letting the hype train leave station so early that it can reach heights unreachable by any developer? And with the delay did this just elevate expectations even more? I have heard and read so many expectation that I don't know any game could fulfill. I guess my only answer will come at the release, but I also want to hear what you guys think. Don't actually know what I want out of this post other than a discussion on the topic, because I think it's very interesting when expectations meet the actual game. And in this case CD Project RED is a developer known for delivering. And is this a double edged sword? Yes, they make good games, but does that make people expect even more? So yeah, what do you expect to happen and is there anything you thing will make people the least happy? Read more New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
