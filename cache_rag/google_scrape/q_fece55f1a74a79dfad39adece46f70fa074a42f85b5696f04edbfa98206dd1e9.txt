Most of the main games have spawned novelizations, adapting and adding to the story of their respective game. Mainline games in the franchise are developed primarily by Canadian studio Ubisoft Montreal and published by French video game company Ubisoft . In recent years, however, more studios have taken the lead on the development of several Assassin's Creed games, including Ubisoft Québec, who developed Assassin's Creed: Syndicate , Assassin's Creed: Odyssey , and Assassin's Creed: Shadows ; Ubisoft Sofia, the developers of Assassin's Creed: Rogue ; and Ubisoft Bordeaux, who developed Assassin's Creed: Mirage . Certain spin-off games are also developed by other companies and only published by Ubisoft, like Assassin's Creed: Altaïr's Chronicles by Gameloft and Assassin's Creed Chronicles by Climax Studios . The series has made appearances on the following video game platforms: Amazon Luna, Android, Apple Macintosh, Google Stadia, iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Windows Phone, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X. The gameplay, while varying slightly from game to game, falls in the historic action-adventure genre, with a heavy emphasis on stealth, combat and free-running. As of December 2024, the series has sold over 230 million copies, making it one of the most financially successful video game franchises of all time.

In April 2012, Assassin's Creed III ' s Creative Director Alex Hutchinson said that settings such as World War II , ancient Egypt , and feudal Japan —popular requests among fans—were not likely to be featured, as they were considered "boring" and unoriginal for Assassin's Creed games. [ 41 ] However, both World War II and ancient Egypt have since been explored in the main games, through the Rifts in Assassin's Creed: Unity (2014) and the entirety of Assassin's Creed: Origins (2016), respectively, while medieval Japan will appear in the upcoming Assassin's Creed: Shadows (2025). In September 2012, Hutchison had also said that the company would refrain from creating trilogies for one protagonist like they did for Ezio Auditore, [ 42 ] though this, too, has thrice been contradicted. In games released in the decade since his statement, the former Abstergo Industries employee Layla Hassan is the medium through which players have experienced Origins, Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (2018), and Assassin's Creed: Valhalla (2020). This is doubly-true for Odyssey and its hero Kassandra , as the game later had two lengthy, three-part downloadable expansions, first with Legacy of the First Blade following Kassandra's fight against the Order of the Ancients in Makedonia , and then with The Fate of Atlantis in which she explored simulated worlds from Greek myth . Following Unity , Darby McDevitt spoke of the company's intention to bring more focus back onto the series' modern-day storyline for future titles, [ 43 ] but developments in newer media have also brought this into scrutiny. Despite the early main games until Assassin's Creed III (2012) building up the Isu Juno as the series' second wider antagonist besides the Templars, her machinations after being released from the Grand Temple and eventual death were covered off-screen in the 2017 comic series Assassin's Creed: Uprising . More recently, Odyssey ' s multi-installment expansions and Valhalla ' s two years' worth of downloadable post-launch content only sporadically touched on the modern day, if at all, while Assassin's Creed: Mirage (2023) marked a series milestone by being the first game to not feature any plot in the present except for a framing device bookending the story's start and end. [ 44 ] In 2020, Ubisoft announced a virtual reality Assassin's Creed game. [ 45 ] In April 2021, Ubisoft unveiled a new transmedia initiative in conjunction with announcing many new transmedia titles. Alongside this, Ubisoft created a new web-hub to promote their projects and publish news about them, rebranding their titles into the categories of Classics , for novelizations of the main games; Chronicles , for revisiting established characters and settings in new stories; and Originals , for stories exploring brand new character and settings.
