J. Watt All-Pros 1 Maurkice Pouncey (2nd team) Team MVP JuJu Smith-Schuster Team ROY Terrell Edmunds Uniform ← 2017 Steelers seasons 2019 → The 2018 season was the Pittsburgh Steelers ' 86th as a professional sports franchise and as a member of the National Football League (NFL). It also marked the 19th season under leadership of general manager Kevin Colbert and the 12th under head coach Mike Tomlin . After starting the season 7–2–1, the Steelers lost four of their last six games, allowing the Ravens to clinch the AFC North on the last day of the season, and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2013 . Off-the-field events [ edit ] The team was mocked in the media due to conflict amongst team members and staff during both the off-season and the regular season, and for subsequently missing the playoffs after a 7–2–1 start. [ 1 ] Star running back Le'Veon Bell refused to sign his franchise tag, holding out for a more permanent contract for what was first expected to be the first few weeks of the season, but later missing out on the entire season. [ 2 ] Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger received criticism for openly calling out teammates during public interviews with the media, as well as for his initial reaction to the team drafting quarterback Mason Rudolph . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Most notably, wide receiver Antonio Brown was involved with a string of incidents, ranging from tossing furniture out of his apartment window in the off-season, [ 5 ] arguing with offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner , clashing with the media about his role on the offense, [ 6 ] and getting cited for speeding in excess of over 100 mph along a suburban highway. [ 7 ] These incidents culminated in Brown reportedly getting into a heated argument with Roethlisberger and benched for the final game of the season against the Cincinnati Bengals as a result, then storming out of the team facility and ignoring all contact from teammates, coaches, and the front office. [ 8 ] Brown's tipping point was suggested to be the Steelers' decision to name receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster as team MVP leading up to Week 17 [ 9 ] which also led up to Brown demanding a trade from the Steelers a few days after the season where he would be eventually traded to the Oakland Raiders at the start of the new NFL year. [ 10 ] Brown also openly called out Smith-Schuster via Twitter [ 11 ] and Instagram in April 2019 [ 12 ] due to his game losing fumble in a Week 16 loss to the New Orleans Saints , which crippled the Steelers playoff chances. [ 13 ] Following the season, fans, commentators, and numerous current and former Steelers lamented the conflict inside the organization, with some blaming the team culture for the late season collapse (which included four close, mistake-filled and penalty-prone losses within the final six games) and head coach Mike Tomlin for his inability to control a drama-filled locker room. [ 1 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] The drama during the Steelers' 2018 season was most notably chronicled in satirical fashion by Steve "Schlasser" Linkowski, a Pittsburgh-based YouTube personality , former video game reviewer, and prominent Steelers fan known for his colorful and rant-filled videos poking fun at sports franchises on his channel UrinatingTree. [ 17 ] Linkowski dubbed his video series focusing on the off-the-field drama as "Days of our Steelers" as a parody of NBC 's soap opera TV show Days of Our Lives . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] The team blocked UrinatingTree on Twitter by Week 6. [ 20 ] The series has continued, albeit more sporadically, during the 2019 and 2020 seasons as a part of his NFL week in review series This Week in Sportsball , and multiple allusions to the series have been made from then on depending on the team's record and playoff situation.

After a scoreless first quarter, the Steelers struck first in the second when second-year RB James Conner ran for a 4-yard touchdown to make it 7–0 at halftime. After the break, the Browns went to work as Tyrod Taylor ran for a 20-yard touchdown to tie the game up at 7–7. However, the Steelers retook the lead with 2 more touchdowns: Ben Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 22-yard pass followed up by Conner's second touchdown of the day from 22 yards out to make it 14–7 and then 21–7. In the fourth quarter however, it was all Browns when Carlos Hyde ran for a 1-yard touchdown followed by Taylor connecting with Josh Gordon on a 17-yard touchdown to make it 21–14 and then 21–21. In overtime, neither team would score, leading to a tie. With the tie, the Steelers started their season 0–0–1. It was the first time ever that they played the Browns to a tie game. [ 21 ] This would snap their 6-game winning streak over the Browns. [ 21 ] Also, the team's winning streak against division rivals was snapped. They also had their first tie game since 2002 against the Atlanta Falcons . Roethlisberger tied his career high of 5 turnovers in a game (3 interceptions, 2 lost fumbles) as the team turned the ball over 6 times including a Conner fumble late in the fourth quarter. Overall, he finished the game with a very poor 60.5 passer rating. On a positive note, the team's defense was able to get a turnover of their own (1 interception) and sack Taylor 7 times. The Steelers also held him to a passer rating of 51.8.

In the first quarter, it was all Chiefs when Patrick Mahomes threw 3 touchdowns: a 15-yard pass to Chris Conley , a 19-yard pass to Travis Kelce , and a 5-yard pass to Kareem Hunt to make the score 7–0, 14–0, and then 21–0. In the second quarter, the Steelers responded with 3 touchdowns of their own to tie the game up when Ben Roethlisberger connected with Jesse James on a 26-yard pass, followed up with him connecting with JuJu Smith-Schuster on a 2-yard pass (with a failed PAT), and then connecting with James Washington on a 14-yard pass (with a successful 2-point conversion pass to James Conner) to make it 21–7, 21–13, and then 21–21 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Chiefs moved back into the lead when Mahomes found Kelce again on a 25-yard pass to make it 28–21. The Steelers would tie it up when James Conner ran for a 1-yard touchdown to make it 28–28. The Chiefs would pull away again as Mahomes connected with Demarcus Robinson on a 3-yard pass to make it 35–28. In the fourth quarter, the Chiefs moved ahead by double digits as Mahomes found Tyreek Hill on a 29-yard pass to make it 42–28. The Steelers scored twice to come within 5: first when Hunt was tackled by Artie Burns and Morgan Burnett in the end zone for a safety followed by Roethlisberger's 3-yard run for a touchdown to make it 42–30 and then 42–37. With seconds left, the defense was able to get the stop and was about to get their offense back on the field for likely one final play. But a flag for roughing the kicker kept the Chiefs' offense on the field, which sealed the game. With the loss, the Steelers dropped to 0–1–1. With the Browns' loss to the Saints, both teams remain tied for third place in the AFC North. Even with Ben Roethlisberger posting a 104.3 passer rating, he could not succeed at helping the Steelers win. Roethlisberger's record against the Chiefs would drop to 6–2. He passed John Elway for seventh-most passing yards in NFL history. [ 22 ] During the game, WR Antonio Brown was caught on camera arguing with offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner for not getting enough playing time during the game. This was only the start of a turmoil-filled season for the Steelers.

However, the Ravens would win that game sending the Steelers to second place in the division, officially missing the playoffs for the first time in 5 years, thus capping off a disappointing and bitter end to one of the most turbulent seasons in franchise history.
