For Ukrainian players, it will be notable for featuring the Ukrainian language. This was reported on the CD Projekt RED website. Ukrainian language support in Cyberpunk 2077 will be available starting from September 26, 2023, both for the base game and the announced expansion. More than a year was spent by the localization teams on translating and adapting over a million lines of text. This includes translating interfaces, dialogues, and in-game messages. Maria Strilchuk, the localization project manager who oversaw the creation of the Ukrainian text for Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty, shared her thoughts on this event: "I am incredibly happy that Ukrainian gamers will soon be able to immerse themselves in the world of Cyberpunk in our native language. We at CD Projekt RED wanted to demonstrate our recognition and support for this part of our community, and I am personally filled with pride and joy knowing that I was able to contribute to making this happen. I can't wait to share the results of our work with you this September," said Maria Strilchuk. Alexander Radkevich, the senior localization project manager who oversaw the production of the Ukrainian localization, shared some details: "Bringing Ukrainian localization to Cyberpunk 2077 was an interesting task for us as a localization team. It is always intriguing to add new languages to an existing game, especially to such a massive project like Cyberpunk 2077. We also worked on both the base game and the expansion simultaneously, which added a level of complexity," explained Radkevich. The events of the game Cyberpunk 2077 take place in a futuristic setting where people modify their bodies with various devices and implants. "Phantom Liberty" is a forthcoming expansion for Cyberpunk 2077 in the style of a spy thriller. It introduces a new storyline with multiple characters, including the secret agent Solomon Reed portrayed by Idris Elba, as well as new side quests, diverse activities in the open world, and more. The expansion will be released on September 26, 2023, for PS5, Xbox Series, and PC. Pre-orders are already available on all popular gaming platforms.
