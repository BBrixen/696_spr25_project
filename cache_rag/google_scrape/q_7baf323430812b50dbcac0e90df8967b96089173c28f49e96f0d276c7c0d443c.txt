Which nominee will take home the coveted best picture award? As of Sunday, the two frontrunners, per Variety’s Marc Malkin, were Sam Mendes’ “1917,” which took home the DGA and PGA award – often an indicator of the Oscars ‘ best picture winner – and Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite,” one of the season’s most popular titles. But that doesn’t mean others, such as Taiki Waititi’s “Jojo Rabbit” or Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Hollywood” don’t have a chance. The Academy Awards have featured some major upsets in years past. In the supporting actor category, Tom Hanks is nominated for “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” Anthony Hopkins for “The Two Popes,” Al Pacino for “The Irishman,” Joe Pesci for “The Irishman,” and Brad Pitt for “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” Up for best supporting actress are Kathy Bates (“Richard Jewell”), Laura Dern (“Marriage Story”), Scarlett Johansson (“Jojo Rabbit”), Florence Pugh (“Little Women”), and Margot Robbie (“Bombshell”).
