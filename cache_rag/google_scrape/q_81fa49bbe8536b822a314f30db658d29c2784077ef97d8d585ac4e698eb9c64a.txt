The contract has been behind schedule and plagued by quality and performance problems . The device received a poor reception from soldiers in a recent test, according to an Army report. Microsoft 's smart goggles for the US military failed most elements of a recent Army test and one tester remarked the device would be dangerous for soldiers to wear, according to excerpts from an Army report dictated to Insider. Microsoft won a contract that could be worth as much as $22 billion to build the device but the contract has been behind schedule and plagued by quality and performance problems . "The devices would have gotten us killed," one tester said of the current iteration of Microsoft's device for the military, in an excerpt of an Army report dictated to Insider. That tester was referring to the light generated by the goggles when they're active, which could alert enemy fighters to soldiers' locations. The device failed in four out of six evaluation events in a recent "operational demo," according to a Microsoft employee briefed about the event. Criticisms, according to the employee who dictated to Insider excerpts of this report, included that the device's glow from the display was visible from hundreds of meters away, which could give away the position of the wearer. Testers also found that the soldiers' field of view including peripheral vision is limited while the headset is on, and the bulk and weight of the device restricts a soldier's movement. Microsoft spokesman Frank X. Shaw referred IVAS questions to the Army. An Army spokesman said the operational test was so far generally considered a success and that the Army remains committed to the IVAS program. "The emerging results indicate that the program achieved success in most of the Army evaluation criteria," Brigadier General Christopher D. Schneider said in a statement to Insider. " However, the results also identified areas where IVAS fell short and needs additional improvements, which the Army will address." "The Army will provide the most reliable and advanced equipment to its soldiers," the statement also said. The Army contract was considered a major milestone for Microsoft in particular and the augmented reality field in general. While headsets like Microsoft's HoloLens are widely considered key to the metaverse vision promoted by leaders like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, they've struggled to find commercial success. Within Microsoft, there's been widespread strategic confusion in the mixed reality division , talent has defected to rivals like Meta, and a recent leadership shakeup has left the business fragmented. Microsoft has expected poor reception from soldiers. Insider viewed an email back in March in which a Microsoft employee warned about a negative reception due to ongoing problems with the device's reliability and its performance in low light environments. "We (Microsoft) are going into the event expecting negative feedback from the customer," the employee wrote on in a memo to members of the company's military contract team, including AI and mixed reality general manager David Marra. "We expect soldier sentiment to continue to be negative as reliability improvements have been minimal from previous events." Are you a Microsoft employee or do you have insight to share?
