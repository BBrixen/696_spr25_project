Wingfield, who is recognized as the inventor of the modern game. Great Moments There have been many dramatic moments and matches in the USTA Nationals, not all of them in the finals. Here are a few: In 1956, Rod Laver, considered by many to be the finest player ever to perform in the tournament here, fought off 12 match points in a three-set, first round match with Oklahoman Don Brewington in 18-and-under singles before advancing to the finals to defeat Chris Crawford, Piedmont, Calif., in straight sets. When Pete Sampras first appeared in Kalamazoo he was short (5 feet even) and slight (88 pounds) but did not lack determination. In the second round of the 16-and-under singles he carried No. 8 seed T. J. Middleton, Dallas, Tex., three sets before losing in a tournament-record five hours-23 minutes, 6-7, 6-4, 18-16. Sampras was just a few days shy of his 13th birthday. The most dramatic match in the memories of long-time viewers of the Nationals was the 1968 18-and-under semifinal singles confrontation between Bob McKinley and the popular Dick Stockton. McKinley won the two-hour nail-biter, 10-8, 12-10, in an era before the insertion of the tie-breaker in the tennis rules. The two players received a prolonged standing ovation from the gallery. Jimmy Connors never won the 18-and-under singles title in the USTA Nationals. Although ranked as the No. 1 seed in the 1970 tournament he was upset in an exhilarating three-set semifinal (6-3, 4-6, 7-5) by eventual champion Brian Gottfried. Tony Trabert, noted for his incisive commentary on network tennis telecasts, passed this way as a junior. During his 1948 singles semifinal against Gil Bogley he removed his shoes for better traction during the first set. Trabert, however, developed blisters by the time the third set rolled around and he was stunned by an underdog Bogley who went on to win back-to-back titles in Kalamazoo. Maryland's Paul Goldstein in 1994 became the first player since Vincent Richards to win three consecutive singles titles in the USTA Nationals. Goldstein was the 16-and-under champion in 1992, and then added the 18-and-under titles in the next two summers. Richards dominated the early Nationals with five championships in a row - the 15-and-under (the age group wasn't changed to 16-and-under until 1962) in 1917-18 and the 18-and-under in 1919-20-21. Aaron Krickstein of Grosse Pointe, Mi., attracted the largest gallery for a finals match (4,506 spectators) in 1983 when he defeated Patrick McEnroe, current Davis Cup Captain and younger brother of seven-time Grand Slam winner John McEnroe, 7-6, 6-1, 4-6, 7-6, for the 18-and-under singles championship. The only time Andre Agassi competed in Kalamazoo, he won a title - in doubles. That was in the USTA Boys' 16 National Championships in 1985. With his two shades of hair - blond in the front and brunette in the back - he was already a tennis rebel! After teaming with John Falbo, the unseeded duo stunned top seeds Jeff Tarango and David Wheaton, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, to win the doubles crown before a sparse crowd. The next year, players at the tournament were laughing because Agassi was missing. He had turned pro. But they weren't laughing long - and when Agassi, ranked fourth in the world, returned to Kalamazoo to play in the opening night exhibition in 1988, an estimated crowd of 6,000, still a record, jammed into Stowe Stadium to watch him and No. 3-ranked Mats Wilander perform. That's just one of the highlights of the Boys' 18 & 16 tournament, which marks its 67th year in Kalamazoo in August, 2009. The Agassi era has been unmatched so far, with players such as Pete Sampras, Jim Courier and Michael Chang moving on to stellar pro careers. Some of the lesser-known players also made for some memorable moments at the Nats in the 'Zoo. Last year, eventual winner Austin Krajicek and Ryan Thacher became the first two lefties ever to compete in the 18s final. It was the third year in a row that Thacher left Kalamazoo with the silver, not gold, ball. In 2006, players competed for the first time on the new blue Deco Turf II, the same surface used at the U.S. Open. Jim Courier returned to Kalamazoo in 2005 to film his documentary, Unstrung: The Movie , which followed seven junior players from the Orange Bowl, in December 2004, through the 2005 U.S. Open, in September. Much of the film centered on the path to Kalamazoo and footage from the 2005 tournament was included in the final product. The 2004 tournament marked the first time pros were permitted to compete, and four of them took advantage of it: eventual 18s winner Scoville Jenkins, Brendan Evans, Phil Simmonds and Donald Young, who turned pro at age 14, celebrated his 15th birthday July 23 and, as the seventh seed in 18s, lost in the fourth round. Scott Oudsema, the first Kalamazoo-area player ever to be seeded among the top 10 in 18s singles, reached the finals as the fourth seed that year, losing to No. 3 Jenkins, 7-5, 6-1, 6-3. In the 2004 doubles final, Oudsema and Evans, the top seeds, lost to No. 2 Vahid Mirzadeh and Simmonds. Nick Rinks is still the only Kalamazoo-area player to win a title at the tournament. He and Mirzadeh took the 16s doubles crown in 2002. But when it comes to doubles, the most colorful team was Bob and Mike Bryan. In 1996, they became the first doubles duo to win back-to-back championships in any class since 1945-46. Andy Roddick won a gold ball in Kalamazoo, but it wasn't in singles. In 1999, he and LeVar Harper-Griffith won the 18s doubles title. The year before, as the top 16s seed, he was upset by No. 3 Alex Bogomolov, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 in the singles final. Roddick had planned to return to Kalamazoo for the opening night exhibition in 2001, but had to cancel after he turned in pair of major upsets in the Tennis Masters Series in Montreal. Mike Russell filled in and joined Taylor Dent for the festivities.
