Heisman Finalists 2012: Collin Klein Doesn't Deserve Top College Football Honor Bleacher Report NFL Draft NFL NBA NHL CFB Shop Play Betting B/R Sports on Max 34:58 Featured Video CFB DAILY W/ UNCLE LOU:  NFL DRAFT RECAP, PORTAL WINNERS AND LOSERS College Basketball Heisman Finalists 2012: Collin Klein Doesn't Deserve Top College Football Honor Pete Schauer Jun 8, 2018 Kansas State quarterback Collin Klein joined Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o and Texas A&M freshman quarterback Johnny Manziel on Monday as the 2012 Heisman Trophy finalists. Had it not been for Johnny Football's record-setting season and Te'o leading the Irish defense into the BCS National Championship game, I'd say that Klein deserves the award. But Manziel did set an SEC record by combining for 4,600 yardsâ€”which is more than Tim Tebow and Cam Newton amassed in their Heisman-winning seasonsâ€”and Te'o will be playing on Jan. 7 at Sun Life Stadium for a national championship.

Manziel Klein Completion Percentage: 68.3 66.2 Passing Yards: 3,419 2,490 Passing TDs: 24 15 Interceptions: 8 7 Rating: 155.9 156.1 Rushing Yards: 1,181 890 Rushing TDs: 19 22 You could argue that Klein having less interceptions and more rushing touchdowns makes him the more worthy candidate to win the Heisman, but that argument would fall on deaf ears. Te'o is also a more deserving Heisman Trophy candidate than the Wildcats' senior QB because of the impact that he has had on his team. Not only will Te'o's Fighting Irish be competing for a BCS National Championship, but Te'o is the captain of a Notre Dame defense that ranks No. 1 in the country in points allowed. All in all, Te'o has racked up 103 tackles, 5.5 tackles for a loss, 1.5 sacks and 7 interceptionsâ€”an interception mark that ranked tied for second-most in the nation. Klein had himself one heck of a season and he deserves all the credit in the world, but unfortunately for him, he had a good season when two other guys had great seasons. Johnny Football deserves the Heisman Trophy hands down, in my opinion. And if voters somehow slip up and the award doesn't go to Manziel, it should go to Te'o before it goes to Klein.
