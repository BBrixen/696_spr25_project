The film earned a total of 11 nominations — the most of any comic book-based movie ever — including best picture, best actor for Joaquin Phoenix, best directing for Todd Phillips and best adapted screenplay for Phillips and Scott Silver. In addition to Joker , eight other films are up for best picture: 1917, Ford v Ferrari, Jojo Rabbit, Little Women, The Irishman, Marriage Story, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Parasite. Following Joker were three films with 10 noms apiece: The Irishman, 1917 and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Meanwhile, Jojo Rabbit, Little Women, Marriage Story and Parasite each earned six noms. Leading the snubs were female directors, as women were left out in the best director category for the second consecutive year. Little Women 's Greta Gerwig was the most glaring category omission. And though Cynthia Erivo nabbed a best actress nomination for Harriet , 19 of the 20 acting nominees were white, marking a year of Oscars almost so white.

John Cho and Issa Rae were on hand to announce the nominations, with nine films up for best picture. Academy members from each of the 17 branches vote to determine the nominees in their respective categories, meaning actors nominate actors, film editors nominate film editors and so on. In the animated feature film and international feature film categories, nominees are selected by a vote of multibranch screening committees. All voting members are eligible to select the best picture nominees. For the second year in a row, the Oscars will go hostless . ABC Entertainment president Karey Burke made the announcement last week when speaking at the Television Critics Association's winter press tour in Pasadena. "Let me confirm it now, together with the Academy, that there will be no traditional host this year," Burke said, stressing the ceremony would repeat what worked last year. The 92nd Academy Awards will be held Sunday, Feb. 9, airing on ABC as part of the network's long-term agreement with the Academy. A full list of nominees follows.
