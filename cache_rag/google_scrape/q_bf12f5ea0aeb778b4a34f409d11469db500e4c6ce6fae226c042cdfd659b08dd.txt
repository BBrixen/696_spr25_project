Soul Wins Oscar for Best Animated Feature May 14, 2021 By Christine N. Ziemba At the 93rd annual Academy Awards ceremony on April 25, CalArts alum Pete Docter (Film/Video BFA 90) took home his third Oscar when Pixar’s Soul won the Best Animated Feature Film category. Docter, who directed and served as one of the writers on the film, shared the award with producer Dana Murray. He had previously won for Up in 2009 and Inside Out in 2015. Doctor’s win cemented CalArts’ imprint upon the Best Animated Feature category. Since it was introduced in 2002 (when Shrek won the award), CalArtians have won the Oscar for feature animation a dozen times. When accepting the award from Union Station in Los Angeles (one of several sites for this year’s Academy Awards ceremony), Docter noted that Joe, the protagonist in Soul , was a music teacher. He said during his acceptance speech, “We want to thank music teachers and art teachers everywhere. … You make the world a better place.” In the Short Film (Animated) category, If Anything Happens I Love You (Netflix) was the night’s winner. Though not directed or produced by CalArtians, the short’s directors Will McCormack and Michael Govier thanked the film’s animation director, Youngran Nho (Film/Video BFA 18) from the stage as well as Nho’s team (and former classmates) animators Haein Michelle Heo (Film Video BFA 19) and Julia Rodrigues (Film/Video BFA 19), saying, “Your art astounds us.” CalArtians at the Academy Awards Courtesy of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences The Academy Awards installed the category of Best Animated Feature Film 20 years ago, and since then nine CalArtians have taken home the Oscar 12 times.
