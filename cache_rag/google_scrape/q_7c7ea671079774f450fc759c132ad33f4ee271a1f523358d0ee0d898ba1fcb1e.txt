"The Open was due to be played in Kent from 12-19 July but it has been necessary to cancel the Championship based on guidance from the UK Government, the health authorities, public services and The R&A’s advisers. This is the first time since the Second World War that golf’s original Championship, first played in 1860, has been cancelled," shared organizers in a statement. The Championship will return in 2021 at Royal St George’s . Sports Director Clay Hall is in talks with the Memorial officials for confirmation on how the tournament will proceed. Organizers disputed a report from Golf Digest that the tournament will go on in June without fans. The Masters, which would be happening this month, will potentially take place in November. "We have identified Nov 9-15 as the intended dates to host the 2020 Masters. We hope the anticipation of staging the Tournament brings a moment of joy to the Augusta community and those who love the game," shared the tournament's chairman.
