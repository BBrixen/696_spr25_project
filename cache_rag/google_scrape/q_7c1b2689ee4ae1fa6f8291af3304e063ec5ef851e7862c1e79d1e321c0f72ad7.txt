The trend began with Willie in 1966 FIFA World Cup , one of the first mascots to be associated with a major sporting competition. The mascot designs represent a characteristic or symbol of the host country, such as flora, fauna, or costume. [ 1 ] The design is frequently one or more anthropomorphic characters targeted at children and coinciding with cartoon shows and merchandise. [ 2 ] The FIFA Women's World Cup events have had official mascots since the 1991 event in China.
