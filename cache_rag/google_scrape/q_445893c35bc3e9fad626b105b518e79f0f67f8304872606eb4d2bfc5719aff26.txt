Title Update 1.6.2 will include some exciting new content for the game, including The Last Chapter, a touching and intimate conclusion to Eivor's saga. This epilogue will tie up some of the storylines developed throughout the game and offer closure to your time among the Raven Clan. Click to expand... Click to shrink... To access The Last Chapter when it releases on December 6, you'll need to complete the following key parts of the game: Complete the main storyline by pledging to all territories of England Complete the mythical story arcs of Asgard and Jotunheim Upgrade your settlement to level 5 and construct the Jomsviking barracks Kill all targets of the Order of the Ancients and unveil its leader Click to expand... Click to shrink... SEASONAL FESTIVALS As Valhalla's post-launch is coming to an end, we have some updates to share on production. We will no longer be running the time-limited festival events in Ravensthorpe. For those who did not have the chance to participate in the Yule, Ostara, Sigrblot, or Oskoreia Festivals, all rewards from past festivals will be available at all merchants located throughout England upon completing the quest The First Night of Samhain (Glowecestrescire arc). This will give you the opportunity to acquire rewards you might have missed out on in exchange for silver. We will also be adding brand-new rewards in this update as a thank you for your continued support! More info to come in our next patch notes. Click to expand... Click to shrink... AN UPDATE ON NEW GAME+ We also want to provide an update on a highly requested feature: New Game+. Community feedback is what continually pushes us to improve our experiences. Since the release of Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the team has been working hard on expanding the core experience of the game with your feedback in mind. Releasing such a diverse range of content over the last two years has been a thrilling experience and we are proud to have shared this journey with you. Assassin's Creed Valhalla has been built as a unique Assassin's Creed experience, one that is very different from its predecessors in its structure, offering new ways of engaging with the world and its characters. When investigating the implementation of New Game+, we realized that the depth of the game gave us limited options to make replayability unique and rewarding. We understand this news will come as a disappointment; however, we hope that the new content released in the past months, including never-before-seen experiences like Forgotten Saga, has provided an exciting and challenging experience for those seeking more replayable content. While we will not be adding New Game+ to Assassin's Creed Valhalla, we do have more content on the way before we wrap up. Click to expand... Click to shrink... WHAT'S TO COME We are happy to announce that our final update will add another highly requested feature by the community: the option to keep your hood up at any time. This new option will be added to the in-game options menu, giving you the chance to always keep your hood equipped, even when taking off Eivor's cloak. This is purely cosmetic and will not impact gameplay or detection but will allow you to further customize your experience. Here's a sneak peek of the new feature: Click to expand... Click to shrink... We can't wait for you to show us your best Assassin moves in combat! We also have a few more surprises in store with this title update...but we'll save those for our final farewell. On behalf of the entire team, we would like to thank you for your love and support over the past two years. It is not without emotion that we bid farewell to the saga of the Wolf-Kissed. Stay tuned for more news – we cannot wait for you to experience the conclusion of Eivor's story this December! SKAL! Click to expand... Click to shrink...

Glad to see they are adding the rewards from them to the game so you can still get them. Did they do this with the prior games too? Giolon One Winged Slayer Member Oct 25, 2017 3,538 Nov 18, 2022 #6 Excited for this! I've loved this entire overall era of AC (Origins, Odyssesy, and Valhalla).

Instant Vintage Unshakable Resolve Member Oct 25, 2017 3,351 Nov 18, 2022 #9 So, on after way after December 6th, I can finally start the game that I've had in my possession since the year of it's release? Excellent. Deleted member 19626 Banned Oct 27, 2017 1,732 Nov 18, 2022 #10 I mean, I finished everything else so I will do it, but BOY, I am ready to be done with this story. I got the big DLC pack and was thinking it was kind of stand alone, a little bummed when I had all my original equipment, at a certain point you can crank every difficulty slider up but you still just mop the floor The Praiseworthy Member Oct 30, 2017 10,369 Nov 18, 2022 #11 I am grateful  for the support and the free updates .. great of them, but they dragged this for waaaaaay too long. If the franchise kept this tradition of bloating the games and dragging them for years, I'm officially will be done with it. and I have been there day 1 for all the main games since the first one. I just don't have the time for it anymore. 100%TrophyMaster Member Oct 27, 2017 2,061 Nov 18, 2022 #12 I am ready for this to be over.   Huge amount of content and some of it pretty good but I'm ready to move on.

FUCKING FINALLY logash Member Oct 27, 2017 6,191 Nov 18, 2022 #15 This is my least favorite of the new Assassin Creed game but I've some how gotten 258 hours out of it. Hope they do a similar amount of content for Odyssey teams next game. PinkCrayon Member Oct 25, 2017 1,420 Nov 18, 2022 #16 Did they ever fix the audio quality in this game? Santar Member Oct 27, 2017 7,047 Norway Nov 18, 2022 #17 Shame they couldn't just program in rotating non server dependent events and also shame about no new game+. At least they're patching in the rewards from the festivals so you can buy them with in game money. Better than nothing. rahji Member Oct 25, 2017 4,265 Nov 18, 2022 #18 Ok I am in again for one last time. Username1198 The Fallen Oct 27, 2017 8,570 Space, Man Nov 18, 2022 #19 Sunk 100 hours in this game without even trying, so I am super looking forward to this.

Click to shrink... NewDust said: grow up. Click to expand... Click to shrink... No. I am glad they aren't adding a new game plus to this game because it honestly doesn't need it and I am glad they realized that. It's already too long and bloated, there aren't enough meaningful narrative choices, you can barely make any builds, and the only thing they could do is add the level scaling from Odyssey and Origins to the start of the game, but people complained about it already. I just want to be done with Valhalla because they've streched this game out for so long and I want to move on but they keep adding stuff to remove my 100% completion of it. davidnolan13 Member Oct 27, 2017 2,761 north east uk Nov 18, 2022 #21 So will this show how her body ends up where it does then?

Click to shrink... so basically you're forcing yourself to play a game that you don't enjoy to prevent a meaningless number from going down and you're glad that they don't add a feature that other people might enjoy just so that you don't "have to" keep doing that TheChungusAmongUs Member Oct 25, 2017 14,500 Nov 18, 2022 #25 NewDust said: You can also just ignore it!? Click to expand... Click to shrink... You heard of the sunk cost fallacy? Yeah, I could ignore it but the problem is I put 150 hrs into this game with all it's dlc, doing all the challenges, tombs, etc just to maintain the 100% completion but they keep adding more stuff to it. I have put way too much time into this game, and I just want my closure with it without them constantly adding more content to remove that completion rate.

I'm gonna be honest, using the fact that you're intentionally following a fallacy to justify something is something I haven't seen before lol BobLoblaw This Guy Helps Member Oct 27, 2017 8,827 Nov 18, 2022 #29 I bought the complete edition a few weeks ago for cheap thinking the story had already wrapped up. I'm dreading playing this game man. 150+ hours for me would take like 3 months with my current gaming schedule. Stat Member Oct 25, 2017 6,299 Nov 18, 2022 #30 I still can't believe that ending. It was so god damn depressing so here's hoping they somehow turn it around. Honestly, the first like 10 hours of this game was awful but I really liked the last 150 (this isnt a joke, I mean it).Once the game gets going, it gets interesting/fun. Deleted member 9241 Oct 26, 2017 10,416 Nov 18, 2022 #31 Glad this will be complete and ready for me to jump into once I am done with Odessey.  I am 125hrs into that and have absolutely no idea how much I have progressed through the story, but it sure seems like there is A LOT more to do. I feel like I might be nearing the halfway point?  Anyway, I've really enjoyed these last few AC games and I'm sure Valhalla will be no different.

Zebesian-X Member Dec 3, 2018 24,953 Nov 18, 2022 #33 Had a decent enough time with Valhalla.

That doesn't make any sense to me at all. Valhalla isn't really any different at all from Origins or Odyssey in structure or experience. Sure, Valhalla has the Asgard side stuff, but that's just more missions in a different environment. I don't think anyone was looking for anything new for NG+. People just wanted to be able to play through the whole game with their endgame build and equipment. Surely it wouldn't be that hard to implement that and let enemies continue to scale. Slackbladder Member Nov 24, 2017 1,223 Kent Nov 18, 2022 #35 Well, I played a lot of this when I had Ubisoft+ but never completed everything like I did with Odyssey. But I think I will go back and finish it off. It's kinda a shame there's no New Game+ for those who want it. Those who don't can of course ignore it. But I don't think the game is right for a NG+ unlike Odyssey which was more of a loot based game in a way that Valhalla isn't. Odyssey also had a much more detailed mastery option where there were dozens of skills to be slowly upgraded where-as I think Valhalla simply has 3 with Bear, Wolf and Raven. Interested what content is in the final DLC. I know at the end of the main story it is suggested that Alfred wins in his fight against the Vikings (or at least stops the spread of Viking settlement into Western England) leading to the establishment of Danelaw in Eastern and Central England. And maybe it shows how Eivor ended up in Vinland.

Good, no one should ever have to suffer the indignity of playing this game twice. KORNdog Banned Oct 30, 2017 8,001 Nov 18, 2022 #38 It's nice that's they've been supporting the game with free DLC. But man...I was so done with the game after just the main storyline, which I already felt was too long. repetitive didn't even begin to describe it... It, along with far cry 6 this gen made me finally accept that whatever ubisoft is right now just isn't for me anymore. Maybe one day they'll do something interesting with the franchise again. Briar36 Member Nov 27, 2017 294 Manhattan Nov 18, 2022 #39 Just make sure Altair outfit is available for every game ever. DrScruffleton Member Oct 26, 2017 14,748 Nov 18, 2022 #40 Glad its over. Ive kept going back for the new achievements, and it got really tiring RandomSeed Member Oct 27, 2017 15,641 Nov 18, 2022 #41 Here's a ton of settlement cosmetics at the end of the game, now no NG+. Kinda odd. Previous two games had it. Just turn all the chests that have gear you already have into the normal crafting mats chests.

However, this is the weirdies AC in the new trilogy for me. The first 15-20 hours were maybe the most fun I've had in the trilogy, but once you start to completely out-level the content (even with using limited level-scaling as your upgrades keep you extremely powerful), and once you see that almost every story arc plays out almost in the same manner and has basically 0 bearing on most other story arcs, it quickly became my least favorite of the trilogy. The world was also by far the least interesting to explore of the trilogy, and I absolutely hated how every chest you found quickly devolved into you having to scour the map for a red barrel or an opening to shoot a lock. Extremely exhausting. Rarely have I played a game for 70 hours and then called it quits without completing it. Smoolio Avenger Oct 25, 2017 4,284 Nov 18, 2022 #49 Excited but scared for this, considering the last "final chapter" for Odyssey forced me into a straight relationship. nihilence nøthing but silence Moderator Oct 25, 2017 18,762 From 'quake area to big OH.
