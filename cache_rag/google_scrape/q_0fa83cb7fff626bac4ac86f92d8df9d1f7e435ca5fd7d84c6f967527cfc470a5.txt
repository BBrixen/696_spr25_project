Members Online • SwerveCityy Quick question about Super Mario 2 and 3's release date. I noticed that officially, 2 and 3 were released just a couple weeks apart. Was this intentional? Did development overlap? Did they make two Mario games in case fans were not pleased with the other? Just seems odd that you would follow up THE game that put gaming on the map forever with TWO titles which at the time were two very different games. Just curious :) Any insight is appreciated!
