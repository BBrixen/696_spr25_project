That feature was not included for the original release on Wii U. However, for Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition on Nintendo Switch, Monolith Soft is including dual audio. That means English and Japanese will both be supported. Since players can switch between them via the game’s settings (as shared by HobbyConsolas ), it’s something that can be easily changed. That’s far from all though. RPG Site also gives us a bunch of details, which we’ve rounded up below. Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition change and improvements – Resolution increased to the point where this has some of the cleanest presentation of all the Xenoblade games currently on Nintendo Switch – Can change party at any time in the Active Members menu; previously had to talk to the character’s dedicated spot in New Los Angeles each time to add them to your party, and couldn’t do so at any time – Can now change the time whenever you want via the System Menu – Quick Cooldown bar added, which means that as long as you have any of the meter remaining, you can ignore the Art cooldown time to cast any art you want with the tap of the Y Button (Arts that require a TP cost still need the required TP); Quick Cooldown restored after each battle and restored gradually with auto attacks; Energy Disks increase the Quick Cooldown pool – New playable characters – New story content is not accessed through a separate menu or launcher – BLADE level removed alongside Division Points and most Field Skill levels; no such thing as “Archaeological Field Skill Level 4” anymore, so most treasures can be obtained right away – FrontierNav has been reworked to work all on one screen – Affinity levels with party members fill more quickly – Party Members not in the active party will still gain EXP and remain roughly around your main character’s level (previously had to level up each party member separately) – Players now gain rewards for completing their survey of Mira, based on the percentages tracked through the map menus (money, Rewards Tickets, Energy Clips) – More defined quest tracking – Can choose the background music that plays when flying a Skell – Other additions as well Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition arrives for Nintendo Switch on March 20, 2025.
