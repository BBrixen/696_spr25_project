The semifinal match between Anderson and John Isner, lasting 6 hours 36 minutes, was the second longest men's singles match at Wimbledon and the third longest men's singles match in tennis history. Isner has thus played in the two longest matches in Wimbledon history (the other one being the record-holding 2010 match against Nicolas Mahut). Anderson became the first man representing South Africa to reach the Wimbledon men's singles final since Brian Norton in 1921 (South African-born Kevin Curren represented the United States when he was a finalist in 1985). By retaining his title Harrison ensured that he ends the year as world number one. By reaching the final Harrison extended his record of consecutive finals to 20. He also became the sixth player to reached five consecutive Wimbledon finals after Roger Federer (7), Björn Borg (6), William Renshaw (6), Laurence Doherty (5) and John McEnroe (5). Feliciano López made his 66th consecutive Grand Slam main draw appearance, surpassing the previous record of 65 consecutive appearances he jointly held with Federer.
