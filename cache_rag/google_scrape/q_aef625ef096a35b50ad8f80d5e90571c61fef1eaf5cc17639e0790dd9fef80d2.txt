It was a great run through the tournament for both women, but Kerber managed to notch her third win over Williams in nine meetings between the two. Seven-time Wimbledon champion Serena Williams will return to the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in search of her next Grand Slam title. It is the next step in her return to high-level play since the birth of her child and the complications that came with it. Williams, despite being ranked outside the top 150 women’s tennis players in the world after her long absence, was given a special seeding of 25 for the tournament, a departure from the French Open in June, which had Williams unseeded. Williams last won Wimbledon in 2016. The defending champion is Garbine Muguruza, the third seed for the 2018 Wimbledon Championships. Muguruza, after struggling leading up to Wimbledon, took down Svetlana Kuznetsova, Magdalena Rybarikova, and then Venus Williams in the final to secure the title a year ago. Simona Halep finally got her coveted Grand Slam title at the aforementioned French Open this year, and will be contending with the likes of Williams, Muguruza, Sloane Stephens (the woman she beat in the Roland Garros final), the second-seeded Caroline Wozniacki, and many others. There are five seeded American women in the bracket, including Stephens (4th), Venus (9th), Madison Keys (10th), CoCo Vandeweghe (16th), and Serena (25th). Serena has a potentially brutal third-round matchup with Elina Svitolina if both win to that point. Below is the bracket, viewing information and then the full schedule and results for the tournament, updated several times a day throughout the final day on July 15.
