New York, USA, 26 August 2022 | Leigh Rogers The US Open 2022 men’s and women’s singles draws have been unveiled. Ten Australians are contesting this year’s US Open men’s singles draw – the most since 1998, when Pat Rafter defeated Mark Philippoussis in an all-Australian final. Two all-Australian battles are set for the first round this year, including a clash between close friends and doubles partners Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis. The Special Ks have not faced-off on the singles court since an ATP Challenger meeting in 2014. James Duckworth and Chris O’Connell, two of the most resilient competitors in Australian tennis, will also play against each other in the opening round. Wildcard Rinky Hijikata, a 21-year-old who recently made his top-200 breakthrough, has been pitted against 22-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal in his major debut. Alex de Minaur, Australia’s top-ranked man, has not been handed an easy draw either. The No.18 seed begins his campaign against world No.45 Filip Krajinovic.
