And – as expected – Nomadland has won Best Picture on a night when the statuettes were split between a number of films, with no single movie dominating. Nomadland went on to win a total of three awards (more on that below) to lead all films, while Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom , Mank , Sound of Metal , Judas and the Black Messiah , and The Father , all tied with two trophies apiece. The latter also managed arguably the biggest upset of the night, with star Anthony Hopkins taking the Best Actor award over the late Chadwick Boseman, who many had pegged as the front runner for his work in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom . History was made on multiple fronts, with the first ever wins for Black and Hispanic creatives in the Makeup and Hairstyling category, and Chloé Zhao becoming the first woman of Asian descent – and only second woman ever – to win Best Director, for Nomadland . Meanwhile, Yuh-jung Youn, who plays an incorrigible grandmother in Minari, became the first South Korean woman to win Best Supporting Actress and delivered an acceptance speech for the ages. In two of the night’s most memorable moments, Daniel Kaluuya won Best Supporting Actor for Judas and the Black Messiah , while Another Round was named Best International Feature Film, allowing director Thomas Vinterberg to pay moving tribute to his late daughter.
