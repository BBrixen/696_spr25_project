Earth has been destroyed by an intergalactic war between two alien races, and humanity is on the brink of annihilation. A small number of survivors, aboard the USS White Whale, crash land on the vast and untamed planet Mira. Now, it falls to you, as a member of BLADE, to help bring humanity back from the edge of extinction…with the aid of powerful giant robots called Skells. Combat basic training Choose from a huge variety of special attacks, skills, and classes in a combat system that’s as deep as you want it to be. The player character swings their sword weapon in combat. Standard attacks During battle, you'll auto-attack with your ranged and melee weapons as you await the right time to use powerful and tactical attacks. Using Arts Arts are special abilities that can do major damage and can even have special effects under certain conditions. Arts need a cooldown period after use before they're available again, so timing is key. Some attacks may inflict status changes to your opponent if you hit them from the front, side, or back. Keep your positioning in mind before unleashing Arts to make the most of their might. Soul Challenge These timing-based challenges pop up during battle from time to time. If you successfully time your button press, you’ll increase party morale and give your party a small boost. Soul Voice When a teammate uses a battle cry, select a corresponding Art to create a party combo. Not only will you do more damage, you'll replenish your party's health and may give temporary stat boosts. Overdrive A special technique that enhances combat abilities for a certain duration. When activated on foot, you'll inflict a large amount of damage to all enemies in battle. The damage you deal is also increased, while enemy debuff resistance is lowered. Pilot powerful Skells Once you’ve proven yourself, you’ll earn the right to pilot and personalize your very own Skell—a powerful machine that can fly, transform into a vehicle for faster overland travel, and wield immense strength in combat with customizable weapons and armor. With three weight classes and a ton of weapon attachments to choose from, a well-tinkered Skell can give you the edge you need. Skells can run, fly, and leap to help get around the world.

Map new areas, collect resources, and try to locate fellow survivors as humanity builds New Los Angeles. New Los Angeles Your colonization ship, the USS White Whale, contained the city of New Los Angeles. Luckily, it survived the ship’s crash landing to become the first (and only) city on Mira. Primordia The continent where New Los Angeles is located, Primordia is a diverse region featuring grasslands, mountains, and large bodies of water. Noctilum A lush, green continent. Its forests and swamps are often lit at night with the eerie glow of insects and giant, luminescent plants. Oblivia Features a desert-like landscape and hulking structures that appear to be what’s left of an alien outpost. Beware of sandstorms. Sylvalum A continent with a strange, bleached-out landscape punctuated with jutting, pollen-filled plants. The wildlife here seems to be particularly powerful. Cauldros This volcanic region is a treacherous land of lava and black metal. It's also home to hostile alien bases, so tread carefully.
