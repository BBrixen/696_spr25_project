[ 1 ] Zuckerberg made a book recommendation every two weeks for a year to his millions of Facebook followers. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Zuckerberg came up with the idea as part of his New Year's Resolution for 2015 after Cynthia Greco, the Audience Development Manager for MediaOnePA/York Newspaper Company, suggested that Zuckerberg read a new book every month. [ 4 ] Zuckerberg modified the idea to one book every two weeks and books which "emphasize learning about new cultures, beliefs, histories and technologies."
