[ 1 ] The livestreams also include third-party titles. [ 2 ] The Developer Direct usually takes place at the beginning of each year in January. [ 3 ] History [ edit ] Xbox Developer Direct was founded as part of Microsoft's ongoing efforts to enhance communication and engagement with gamers worldwide. [ 4 ] Prior to Devolder Direct, some critics argued that Xbox needed to have a showcase to establish "brand identity" and differentiate themselves from other competitors. Additionally, there were suggestions that Xbox should be more transparent regarding the development of their video games. [ 5 ] The first showcase was announced on January 11, 2023, and took place on January 25, 2023.  Developer Direct has evolved and expanded. Initially focusing on presentations from Xbox Game Studios and Bethesda Softworks, in 2024 the event series has grown to encompass a broader range of developers and publishers, including third-party titles. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Following Microsoft Gaming's strategic pivot towards multiplatform publishing in 2024, the January 2025 installment of Xbox Developer Direct was the first presentation to advertise the availability of Xbox's first-party titles on platforms outside Microsoft's ecosystem, such as Ninja Gaiden 4 and Doom: The Dark Ages on PlayStation 5 . Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer confirmed the following month that all Microsoft Gaming showcases going forward would be transparent about the availability of their games on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Format [ edit ] Each Xbox Developer Direct event typically features a combination of announcements, trailers, gameplay reveals, and developer interviews. These presentations offer audiences a look into upcoming games, downloadable content (DLC), expansion packs , updates, and other relevant developments. [ 9 ] The format allows developers to showcase their games directly to fans and consumers and announce brand-new video game content. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] List of events [ edit ] Alongside the Xbox Developer Direct livestreams, other Xbox events without the "Xbox Developer Direct" branding are listed.
