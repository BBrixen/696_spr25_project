Ross, who is originally from Upper Darby, Pa., earned                         her certificate in administration and supervision from Loyola University Maryland in 2019. She currently serves as the equity liaison                         and social studies department chair at Deer Park Middle School in Randallstown, Md. “It’s important to recondition and reframe the narrative [about education],” said                         Ross. “I feel strongly that teaching should be grounded in love for our students.                         Teaching is a revolutionary act of love.” As Teacher of the Year, Ross will spend the upcoming year as a speaker and advisor,                         representing the State of Maryland at meetings and events hosted by the National Teacher                         of the Year Program. “I loved Loyola’s program because the courses had social justice threaded throughout,”                         said Ross. “Dr. Flores-Koulish has been and continues to be a great mentor and I hope                         to provide the same framework of social justice in my teaching and experiences in                         educational leadership.” Ross holds a Bachelor of Science in applied developmental psychology and a Master                         of Education in curriculum and instruction, both from University of Pittsburgh; she                         is currently pursuing her doctorate in urban educational leadership from Morgan State                         University. Ross aspires to further her career in school leadership where she can                         lead schools of Black and Brown students, foster community engagement, assess needs,                         and make connections. She also would like to work as an adjunct faculty member where                         she can mentor first-year teachers and provide an immersive experience. “The recognition of Ms. Brianna Ross as the 2021-22 Maryland Techer of the Year is                         an extraordinary achievement and well-deserved acknowledgement of the profound educational,                         inspirational, and transformational difference she makes in the lives of her students,                         her community, and our state,” said Cheryl Moore-Thomas, Ph.D., acting provost and                         vice president for academic affairs. “We are honored that Ms. Ross chose Loyola as                         part of her educational preparation. Her excellence and commitment drive what we do                         as educators and sets the bar of excellence that well serves Maryland’s K-12 learners.” In her role at Deer Park Middle School, Ross works with teachers to understand biases                         and stereotypes. She also coordinates a Summer Transition Program to help elementary                         students prepare for and thrive in middle school. “We are of proud of Ms. Briana Ross's achievement as the 2021-22 Maryland Teacher                         of the Year,” said Afra  Hersi , Ph.D., interim dean of the School of Education and professor of literacy teacher education. “She is truly driving education forward                         through her excellence and commitment to equity.” Ross joins a number of Loyola graduates who have been selected as Maryland Teacher                         of the Year.
