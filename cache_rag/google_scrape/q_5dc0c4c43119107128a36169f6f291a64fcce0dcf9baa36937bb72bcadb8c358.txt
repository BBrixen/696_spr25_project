Business & Tech Nutmeg Wins 2019 Dora Maxwell Social Responsibility Award Credit Union Awarded Third Consecutive Award For Community Excellence Kathy Callahan , Community Contributor Posted Mon, Dec  16, 2019 at 10:26 am ET Nutmeg State Financial Credit Union was presented the Dora Maxwell Social Responsibility Community Service Award following its extensive collaboration with Channel 3 Kids Camp, an organization dedicated to providing educational camp programs to children across the state. This is the credit union‚Äôs third consecutive year as the winner after their previous work with the March of Dimes charity organization. Each year, the Dora Maxwell award recognizes a Connecticut credit union that demonstrates a high commitment to community and social organizations. Nutmeg‚Äôs work with Channel 3 Kids Camp spans a ten-year partnership that has resulted in impactful events like the Hartford Holiday Light Fantasia, Channel 3 Telethon Fundraiser and Golf Tournament at Mohegan Sun. In 2018 alone, the credit union helped raise over $100,000 across all community events to benefit Channel 3 Kids Camp. ‚ÄúWe are honored to accept the Dora Maxwell award for a third year,‚Äù said Nutmeg President and CEO John Holt. ‚ÄúWorking with Channel 3 Kids Camp has become so much more than just a partnership over the years. It‚Äôs an important community tradition that we intend to continue into the future.‚Äù The credit union will now move on as a finalist in the running for a national-level award, which will be presented at the 2020 Governmental Affairs Conference (GAC) in Washington, DC.
