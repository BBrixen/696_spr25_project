Former President Donald Trump's stance on key economic issues includes:

1. Tax Cuts: Trump passed the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in 2017, which slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. He proposed extending these cuts, which will expire at the end of 2025.
2. Inflation: Trump has called for cutting taxes and regulations to lower inflation.
3. Wages: Trump wants to make tips tax-free under a new proposal, which could mean more take-home pay for workers.
4. Energy Production: Trump has called for increasing fossil fuel production to lower energy prices.
5. Payroll Taxes: Trump proposed doubling the standard deduction and child tax credit, which funds Medicare and Social Security.
6. Budget Deficits: With larger tax cuts and increased spending, the federal government's budget deficit could increase.
7. Tariffs: Trump has suggested tariffs as high as 100% on Chinese goods to reduce demand and lower prices.
8. Social Security and Medicare: By funding these programs through the payroll tax, workers could see bigger take-home pay.
