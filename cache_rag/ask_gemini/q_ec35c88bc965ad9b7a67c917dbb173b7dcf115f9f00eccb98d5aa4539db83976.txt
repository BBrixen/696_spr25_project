Based on the document, Ashleigh Barty did **not** win the ladies' singles title in 2018. The document states that Novak Djokovic won the gentlemen's singles title and Ashleigh Barty won the ladies' singles title, but it also says the information refers to the Wimbledon Championships. Therefore, the document does not contain the answer to who won the women's singles Wimbledon in 2018.
