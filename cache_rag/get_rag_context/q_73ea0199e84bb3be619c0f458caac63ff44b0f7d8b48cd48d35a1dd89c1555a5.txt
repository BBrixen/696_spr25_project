[ 415 ] Their second child was born via surrogacy . [ 417 ] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were "semi-separated" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single. [ 418 ] [ 419 ] In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of X Æ A-Xii. [ 420 ] [ 421 ] [ 422 ] Musk also has four children with Shivon Zilis , director of operations and special projects at Neuralink : twins born via IVF in 2021, a child born in 2024 via surrogacy and a child born in 2025. [ 423 ] [ 424 ] [ 425 ] [ 426 ] [ 427 ] Wealth These paragraphs are an excerpt from Wealth of Elon Musk . [ edit ] Elon Musk is the wealthiest person in the world , with an estimated net worth of US$301 billion as of March 10, 2025, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , [ 428 ] and $320 billion according to Forbes , [ 429 ] primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX . [ 430 ] Having been first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, [ 431 ] around 75% of Musk's wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020. [ 432 ] Describing himself as " cash poor ", [ 433 ] [ 434 ] a year later, he became the first person in the world to have a net worth above $300 billion. By December 2024, he became the first person to reach a net worth of $400 billion. [ 435 ] Musk Foundation Main article: Musk Foundation Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001, [ 436 ] [ 437 ] whose stated purpose is to provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas, with an interest in human space exploration, pediatrics , renewable energy, and "safe artificial intelligence". [ 438 ] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation donated nearly half of its $25 million directly to Musk's OpenAI. [ 439 ] [ 440 ] The foundation's assets reached $9.4 billion by the end of 2021, but it only dispensed $160 million to charities that year. [ 441 ] The Musk Foundation has been criticized for its "self-serving" [ 441 ] donations to efforts close to Musk's family and companies, [ 442 ] as well as its low payout ratio. [ 441 ] [ 443 ] In 2021, after Musk challenged World Food Programme director David Beasley to draft a plan to use money of Musk's that Beasley said could contribute to ending world hunger , [ 444 ] [ 445 ] Musk instead donated the $6 billion in question to his own foundation even after Beasley's plan showed that the money could feed 42 million people for a year. [ 446 ] [ 441 ] [ 447 ] Public image Main article: Public image of Elon Musk Although his ventures have been highly influential within their separate industries starting in the 2000s, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and impactful decisions, while also often making controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Musk's actions and his expressed views have made him a polarizing figure. [ 448 ] Biographer Ashlee Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his "part philosopher, part troll " persona on Twitter. [ 449 ] During a 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference , Musk, while wearing a gold chain, sunglasses, and holding a chainsaw, stated: "I am become meme ". [ 450 ] Musk has been described as an American oligarch due to his extensive influence over public discourse, social media, industry, politics, and government policy. [ 451 ] After Trump's re-election, Musk's influence and actions during the transition period and the second presidency of Donald Trump led some to call him "President Musk", the "actual president-elect", "shadow president" or "co-president".

Since 2025, he has been a senior advisor to United States president Donald Trump and the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk is the wealthiest person in the world ; as of March 2025, [update] Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$330 billion. Born to a wealthy family in Pretoria , South Africa, in 1989 Musk emigrated to Canada, whose citizenship he had inherited through his mother. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in the U.S. before moving to California to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2 . Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com , an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal , which was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. That year, Musk also became a U.S. citizen.

As CEO of multiple major companies, including Tesla, Inc. ( TSLA ), SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter), Musk is one of the world's wealthiest business people. He is also now likely the world's most powerful. In what the Financial Times has called "a hostile takeover of the U.S. government," Musk leveraged over $280 million in campaign donations and vocal support for Donald Trump during the 2024 election into a significant position as (unofficial) head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he now wields unprecedented sway over federal policy and spending. Key Takeaways Musk leads multiple major companies including Tesla, SpaceX, and X. He has a net worth of about $400 billion in the first quarter of 2025. Tesla faces challenges including an annual sales decline in 2024 and the invalidation of Musk's $56 billion compensation package. Recent controversies, including his political activities and management of X, have impacted his companies' market positions. Bailey Mariner / Investopedia Early Life and Education Born in 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa, Elon Reeve Musk's early years were marked by privilege and personal challenges. His father, Errol Musk, worked as an electromechanical engineer and property developer, while his mother, Maye Musk, was a model and dietitian. The family's considerable wealth came primarily from Errol's engineering consulting work and his stake in an emerald mine. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived with his father, a decision he would later describe as a mistake. As a child, Musk enjoyed reading science fiction and experimenting with computers. His first notable achievement was creating and selling a video game called "Blastar" for $500, an early hint of his entrepreneurial spirit. Musk attended Pretoria Boys High School, but feelings of isolation and bullying marred his school years. He moved to Canada at 17 and enrolled at Queen’s University, Ontario, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned dual bachelor’s degrees in economics and physics. Early Career Musk co-founded his first significant venture, Zip2, with his brother Kimbal in the mid-1990s. Initially operating from a small rented office in Palo Alto, CA, Zip2 provided business directories and maps for newspapers during the early days of the Internet. In 1999, Compaq acquired Zip2 for about $307 million, making Musk a multimillionaire in his late 20s. With this newfound capital, Musk was quick to launch X.com in 1999, an online financial portal. Within a year, X.com merged with its primary competitor, Confinity, which had developed the online payment system, PayPal . When eBay Inc. ( EBAY ) acquired PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion, Musk received about $160 million after taxes for his stake. Major Ventures SpaceX SpaceX , founded by Musk in 2002, has built its $350 billion valuation largely through government contracts, receiving over $22 billion from NASA, the Department of Defense, and other federal agencies. While its early years were fraught with setbacks—its first three launches failed to reach space—the company has since achieved significant milestones in space exploration, becoming the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station. Did SpaceX begin with a spitting incident? That's the claim of several around Musk when he formed the company. After a Russian rocket designer spat on his shoes in 2001, "this act so completely offended Elon that he decided on the flight home [from Russia] that he would start his own rocket company to compete with them," former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver has written. The company has also expanded into commercial satellite services through its Starlink constellation, which provides global broadband connectivity. Tesla No company is more closely associated with Elon Musk than Tesla. Although he was not one of the original founders, Musk was an early investor and quickly assumed a leadership role. Under his guidance, Tesla has shown that electric vehicles could be both high-performance and desirable. Today, Tesla not only produces popular models like the Model S, 3, X, and Y, but is also a major producer of battery storage and solar systems since its 2016 acquisition of SolarCity. In 2024, the company launched its Cybertruck, starting at $82,000, though sales remain underwhelming at 9,000 to 12,000 units per quarter. While Tesla has revamped the Model Y for 2025, it notably scrapped plans for a more affordable $25,000 vehicle (Model 2). Despite numerous challenges, including production delays, regulatory scrutiny, and periodic financial pressures Tesla has been remarkably successful.

In Germany, Musk has endorsed the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), and urged Germans to back the party in forthcoming elections. In the UK and Germany, 71% of people said they took a negative view of Musk, with 63% saying they don't think he has much knowledge of national issues, according to YouGov . Where was Elon Musk born? Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Mr Musk showed his talents for entrepreneurship early, going door-to-door with his brother selling homemade chocolate Easter eggs and developing his first computer game at the age of 12. He has described his childhood as difficult, affected by his parents' divorce, bullying at school and his own difficulty picking up on social cues because of Asperger's Syndrome. At the earliest opportunity, he left home for college, moving to Canada and then the US, where he studied economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League college. In a 2010 essay for Marie Claire , his first wife, Justine Musk, a writer whom he met in college and married in 2000, wrote that even before making his millions Mr Musk was "not a man who takes no for an answer". "The will to compete and dominate, that made him so successful in business, did not magically shut off when he came home," she recalled, adding that he told her while dancing at their wedding, "I am the alpha in this relationship." How did Elon Musk make his money? After being accepted to a physics graduate degree programme at Stanford University, Mr Musk quickly dropped out and founded two technology start-ups during the "dotcom boom" of the 1990s. These included a web software firm and an online banking company that eventually became PayPal, which was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5bn (£1.2bn). He ploughed his fortune into a new rocket company, SpaceX - which he aimed to make a cost-effective alternative to Nasa - and a new electric car company, Tesla, where he chaired the board until becoming chief executive in 2008. Getty Images Elon Musk in 2004, soon after starting SpaceX The two firms are credited with upending their industries, even as they sometimes veered close to financial collapse. More recent business ventures include his takeover of social media platform Twitter in October 2022. He dramatically reduced the size of its workforce including, controversially, cuts to teams responsible for keeping the platform safe; rebranded the company as X; and introduced new premium subscriptions so that the business did not rely on advertising alone for income. Mr Musk's long-term ambition is for X to become an "everything app" offering a range of services. However, so far the value of the firm has plunged from the $44bn he originally paid to just $9.4bn, according to some estimates. Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed "the great X-odus". Reports suggest hate speech has been growing under Mr Musk's X tenure , and some firms don't want to be associated with that. Leaving X can be a tricky decision for brands He also has ambitions in the AI sector, being an early investor in ChatGPT's parent company before parting ways in 2018, and setting up his own company xAI "to understand the true nature of the universe" in 2023. In February 2024, he sued OpenAI and its boss Sam Altman , saying the firm he helped found had reneged on its non-profit, open source origins by hitching its wagon to Microsoft. A year later, Musk led a takeover bid which was firmly rejected by Altman , who suggested a $9.74bn counter-offer for X. "I'm never hugely convinced that he knows what he wants to do tomorrow," says journalist Chris Stokel-Walker of Mr Musk's wide-ranging interests. "He very much leads by instinct." In a 2015 biography, author Ashlee Vance described Mr Musk as "a confrontational know-it-all" with an "abundant ego". But he also called him an awkward dancer and diffident public speaker. In the press, he's been dubbed both a mad genius and Twitter's biggest troll - known as much for his lofty ambitions as his petty fights, not to mention the more serious lawsuits he and his companies have faced from regulators, investors and others over issues such as racial discrimination and the trustworthiness of his claims. Divorced three times - twice from the same woman, British actress Talulah Riley - Mr Musk is frank about his faults. "If you list my sins, I sound like the worst person on Earth," Mr Musk said in a TED interview in 2022 .
