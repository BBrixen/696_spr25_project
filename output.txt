Musk\n(\n/\nˈ\niː\nl\nɒ\nn\n/\nEE\n-lon\n; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman known for\nhis key roles\nin\nTesla\n,\nSpaceX\n, and\nTwitter\n(which he\nrebranded as X\n). Since 2025, he has been a\nsenior advisor\nto United States president\nDonald Trump\nand the\nde facto\nhead of the\nDepartment of Government Efficiency\n(DOGE). Musk is the\nwealthiest person in the world\n; as of March\xa02025,\n[update]\nForbes\nestimates\nhis net worth\nto be US$330\xa0billion.\nBorn to\na wealthy family\nin\nPretoria\n, South Africa, in 1989 Musk emigrated to Canada, whose citizenship he had inherited through his mother. He graduated from the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\nin the U.S. before moving to\nCalifornia\nto pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company\nZip2\n. Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded\nX.com\n, an online payment company that later merged to form\nPayPal\n, which was acquired by\neBay\nin 2002 for $1.5 billion. That year, Musk also became a U.S. citizen.\nIn 2002, Musk founded SpaceX and became its CEO and chief engineer. The company has since led innovations in\nreusable rockets\nand\ncommercial spaceflight\n. In 2004, Musk joined Tesla, Inc., as an early investor, and became its CEO and product architect in 2008; it has become a market leader in\nelectric vehicles\n. In 2015, he co-founded\nOpenAI\nto advance\nartificial intelligence\nresearch, but left its board in 2018. In 2016, Musk co-founded\nNeuralink\n, a company focused on\nbrain–computer interfaces\n, and in 2017 launched\nthe Boring Company\n, which aims to develop tunnel transportation. Musk was named\nTime\nmagazine\'s Person of the Year\nin 2021. In 2022, he acquired Twitter, implementing significant changes and rebranding it as X in 2023. In January 2025, he was appointed head of Trump\'s newly created DOGE.\nMusk\'s political activities\nand\nviews\nhave made him\na polarizing figure\n. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including\nCOVID-19 misinformation\nand\npromoting conspiracy theories\n. His acquisition of Twitter (now X) was controversial due to a subsequent\nincrease in hate speech\nand the\nspread of misinformation\non the service. He has engaged in political activities in several countries, including as a vocal and financial supporter of Trump. Musk was the largest donor in the\n2024 U.S. presidential election\nand is a supporter of global\nfar-right\nfigures, causes, and political parties.\nEarly life\nSee also:\nMusk family\nElon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in\nPretoria\n, South Africa\'s administrative capital.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nHe is of British and\nPennsylvania Dutch\nancestry.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\nHis mother,\nMaye\n(\nnée\nHaldeman\n), is a model and dietitian born in\nSaskatchewan\n, Canada, and raised in South Africa.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\n[\na\n]\nHis father,\nErrol Musk\n, is a South African\nelectromechanical engineer\n, pilot, sailor, consultant,\nemerald\ndealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at\nTimbavati Private Nature Reserve\n.\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\nElon has a younger brother,\nKimbal\n, a younger sister,\nTosca\n, and four paternal half-siblings.\n[\n18\n]\n[\n19\n]\n[\n8\n]\n[\n20\n]\nMusk was raised in the\nAnglican Church\n, in which he was\nbaptized\n.\n[\n21\n]\n[\n22\n]\nThe Musk family was wealthy during Elon\'s youth.\n[\n17\n]\nDespite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,\n[\n17\n]\nin 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive "a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines".\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\nErrol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid\nProgressive Party\nand has said that his children shared their father\'s dislike of\napartheid\n.\n[\n2\n]\nAfter his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n14\n]\nElon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.\n[\n25\n]\nElon has recounted trips to a wilderness school that he described as a "paramilitary\nLord of the Flies\n" where "bullying was a virtue" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.\n[\n26\n]\nIn one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.\n[\n27\n]\nElon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital.\n[\n27\n]\nErrol denied berating Elon and claimed, "The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?"\n[\n28\n]\nElon was an enthusiastic reader of books, and had attributed his success in part to having read\nThe Lord of the Rings\n, the\nFoundation\nseries\n, and\nThe Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy\n.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n29\n]\nAt age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the\nVIC-20\nuser manual.\n[\n30\n]\nAt age twelve, Elon sold his\nBASIC\n-based game\nBlastar\nto\nPC and Office Technology\nmagazine for approximately $500.\n[\n31\n]\n[\n32\n]\nEducation\nMusk graduated from\nPretoria Boys High School\nin South Africa.\nMusk attended\nWaterkloof House Preparatory School\n,\nBryanston High School\n, and then\nPretoria Boys High School\n, where he graduated.\n[\n33\n]\nMusk was a good but unexceptional student, earning a 61 in\nAfrikaans\nand a B on his senior math certification.\n[\n34\n]\nMusk applied for a Canadian passport\nthrough\nhis Canadian-born mother to avoid South Africa\'s\nmandatory military service\n,\n[\n35\n]\n[\n36\n]\nwhich would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime,\n[\n2\n]\nas well as to ease his path to immigration to the United States.\n[\n37\n]\nWhile waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the\nUniversity of Pretoria\nfor five months.\n[\n38\n]\nMusk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,\n[\n39\n]\n[\n40\n]\nand worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.\n[\n41\n]\nIn 1990, he entered\nQueen\'s University\nin\nKingston, Ontario\n.\n[\n42\n]\n[\n43\n]\nTwo years later, he transferred to the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n, where he studied until 1995.\n[\n44\n]\nAlthough Musk has said that he earned his degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997 – a\nBachelor of Arts\nin physics and a\nBachelor of Science\nin economics from the university\'s\nWharton School\n.\n[\n45\n]\n[\n46\n]\n[\n47\n]\n[\n48\n]\n[\n49\n]\nHe reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to\nGoogle Books\n.\n[\n50\n]\nIn 1994, Musk held two internships in\nSilicon Valley\n: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic\nsupercapacitors\nfor energy storage, and another at\nPalo Alto\n–based startup\nRocket Science Games\n.\n[\n51\n]\n[\n52\n]\nIn 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in\nmaterials science\nat\nStanford University\n, but did not enroll.\n[\n47\n]\n[\n45\n]\n[\n53\n]\nMusk decided to join the\nInternet boom\n, applying for a job at\nNetscape\n, to which he reportedly never received a response.\n[\n54\n]\n[\n35\n]\nThe Washington Post\nreported that Musk lacked legal authorization to remain and work in the United States after failing to enroll at Stanford.\n[\n53\n]\nIn response, Musk said he was allowed to work at that time and that his student visa transitioned to an\nH1-B\n. According to numerous former business associates and shareholders, Musk said he was on a student visa at the time.\n[\n55\n]\nBusiness career\nMain article:\nBusiness career of Elon Musk\nZip2\nMain article:\nZip2\nExternal videos\nMusk speaks of his early business experience during a 2014 commencement speech at University of Southern California\non YouTube\nIn 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company\nZip2\nwith funds borrowed from Musk\'s father.\n[\n56\n]\n[\n25\n]\nThey housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.\n[\n57\n]\nThe company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages.\n[\n58\n]\nAccording to Musk, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time."\n[\n57\n]\nThe Musk brothers obtained contracts with\nThe New York Times\nand the\nChicago Tribune\n,\n[\n59\n]\nand persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with\nCitySearch\n.\n[\n60\n]\nMusk\'s attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the board.\n[\n61\n]\nCompaq\nacquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,\n[\n62\n]\n[\n63\n]\nand Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.\n[\n64\n]\nX.com and PayPal\nMain articles:\nX.com (bank)\n,\nPayPal\n, and\nPayPal Mafia\nIn 1999, Musk co-founded\nX.com\n, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.\n[\n65\n]\nThe startup was one of the first\nfederally insured\nonline banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over 200,000 customers joined the service.\n[\n66\n]\nThe company\'s investors regarded Musk as inexperienced and replaced him with\nIntuit\nCEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.\n[\n67\n]\nThe following year, X.com merged with online bank\nConfinity\nto avoid competition.\n[\n57\n]\n[\n67\n]\n[\n68\n]\nFounded by\nMax Levchin\nand\nPeter Thiel\n,\n[\n69\n]\nConfinity had its own money-transfer service,\nPayPal\n, which was more popular than X.com\'s service.\n[\n70\n]\nWithin the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk\'s preference for\nMicrosoft\nsoftware over\nUnix\ncreated a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.\n[\n71\n]\nDue to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in 2000.\n[\n72\n]\n[\nb\n]\nUnder Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.\n[\n74\n]\n[\n75\n]\nIn 2002, PayPal was acquired by\neBay\nfor $1.5\xa0billion in stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8\xa0million.\n[\n76\n]\n[\n77\n]\nIn 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it had sentimental value.\n[\n78\n]\n[\n79\n]\nSpaceX\nMain article:\nSpaceX\nMusk explains\nStarship\ncapabilities to leaders of\nNorth American Aerospace Defense Command\n, U.S. Northern Command, and\nAir Force Space Command\nin 2019\nIn 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit\nMars Society\nand discussed funding plans to place a\ngrowth-chamber for plants\non\nMars\n.\n[\n80\n]\nSeeking a way to launch the greenhouse payloads into space, Musk made two unsuccessful trips to Moscow to purchase\nintercontinental ballistic missiles\n(ICBMs) from Russian companies\nNPO Lavochkin\nand\nKosmotras\n.

By December 2024, he became the first person to reach a net worth of $400\xa0billion.\n[\n8\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nElon Musk made $175.8\xa0million when\nPayPal\nwas sold to\neBay\nin October 2002.\n[\n9\n]\nHe was first listed on the\nForbes Billionaires List\nin 2012, with a net worth of $2\xa0billion.\n[\n4\n]\nMusk paid $455\xa0million in taxes on $1.52\xa0billion of income between 2014 and 2018.\n[\n10\n]\nAccording to\nProPublica\n, Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018.\n[\n11\n]\nHe stated his 2021 tax bill was estimated at $12\xa0billion based on his sale of $14\xa0billion worth of Tesla stock.\n[\n10\n]\nMusk has repeatedly described himself as "\ncash poor\n",\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\nand has "professed to have little interest in the material trappings of wealth".\n[\n6\n]\nIn May 2020, he pledged to sell almost all physical possessions.\n[\n7\n]\nMusk has defended his wealth by saying he is accumulating resources for\nhumanity\'s outward expansion to space\n.\n[\n12\n]\nAt the start of 2020, Elon Musk had a net worth of $27\xa0billion.\n[\n13\n]\nBy the end of the year his net worth had increased by $150\xa0billion, mostly driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock.\n[\n14\n]\nDuring this period, Musk\'s net worth was often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3\xa0billion on September 8, the largest single-day plunge in\nBloomberg Billionaires Index\n\'\ns\nhistory at the time.\n[\n15\n]\nIn November of that year, Musk passed Facebook co-founder\nMark Zuckerberg\nto become the third-richest person in the world; a week later he passed\nMicrosoft\nco-founder\nBill Gates\nto become the second-richest.\n[\n5\n]\nIn January 2021, Musk, with a net worth of $185\xa0billion, surpassed\nAmazon\nfounder\nJeff Bezos\nto become the richest person in the world.\n[\n16\n]\nBezos reclaimed the top spot the following month.\n[\n17\n]\nOn September 27, 2021, after Tesla stock surged, Forbes announced that Musk had a net worth of over $200\xa0billion,\n[\n18\n]\nand was the richest person in the world. In November 2021, Musk became the first person to have a net worth of more than $300\xa0billion.\n[\n19\n]\nOn December 30, 2022, due to declining stock values in Tesla, Musk had lost $200\xa0billion from his net worth, the first person in history to do so,\n[\n20\n]\n[\n21\n]\nwhich was recognized by\nGuinness World Records\nin January 2023.\n[\n22\n]\nMusk\'s net worth surged after the\n2024 United States presidential election\n, and in December 2024, he became the first person to have a net worth of more than $400\xa0billion.\n[\n8\n]\nA primary customer, the\nfederal government of the United States\nhas signed contracts worth $20\xa0billion with SpaceX as of November\xa02024\n[update]\n.\n[\n23\n]\nMusk\'s association with the\nTrump administration\nreceived backlash, resulting in his net worth dropping by $126 billion between December 2024 and March 2025.\n[\n24\n]\nSources of wealth\n[\nedit\n]\nAround 75% of Musk\'s wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020,\n[\n5\n]\na proportion that fell to about 37% as of December 2022,\n[\na\n]\nafter selling nearly $40\xa0billion in company shares since late 2021.\n[\n25\n]\nMusk does not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed with the board in 2018 to a compensation plan that ties his personal earnings to Tesla\'s valuation and revenue.\n[\n14\n]\nThe deal stipulated that Musk only received the compensation if Tesla reached certain market values.\n[\n26\n]\nIt was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and a company board.\n[\n27\n]\nIn the first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69\xa0million Tesla shares (about 1% of the company) at below-market prices, which was worth about $800\xa0million.\n[\n27\n]\n[\n26\n]\nIn January 2024, Delaware Judge\nKathaleen McCormick\nruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk\'s $55\xa0billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded.\n[\n28\n]\nMcCormick called the compensation granted by the company\'s board "an unfathomable sum" that was unfair to shareholders. In response to the ruling, Musk posted on X: "Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware."\n[\n29\n]\nA re-ratification shareholders\' vote passed in mid-June 2024, although much follow-up litigation is expected, including a lawsuit filed by a Tesla investor beforehand that alleged Musk employed "coercive tactics" to move the vote in his favor.\n[\n30\n]\nManagement\n[\nedit\n]\nMusk\'s wealth is managed by his\nfamily office\ncalled Excession LLC, formed in 2016 and run by\nJared Birchall\n.\n[\n31\n]\nMusk Foundation\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section is an excerpt from\nMusk Foundation\n.\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nMusk Foundation\nis a\nUS\n-based charitable\nfoundation\nfunded and directed primarily by\nElon Musk\n.

A mannequin in a\nspacesuit\n, dubbed "Starman", occupies the driver\'s seat. The car and rocket are products of\nTesla\nand\nSpaceX\n, respectively, both companies headed by\nElon Musk\n.\n[\n5\n]\nThe\n2010 Roadster\nis personally owned by and previously used by Musk for commuting to work.\n[\n2\n]\nIt is the first\nproduction car\nlaunched into space.\nThe car, mounted on the rocket\'s second stage, was launched on an\nescape trajectory\nand entered an\nelliptical\nheliocentric orbit\ncrossing the orbit of\nMars\n.\n[\n6\n]\nThe orbit reaches a maximum distance from the Sun at\naphelion\nof 1.66\nastronomical units\n(au).\n[\n4\n]\nVideo of the Roadster during the launch was transmitted back to the\nmission control center\nand live-streamed.\n[\n7\n]\nAdvertising analysts noted Musk\'s sense of\nbrand management\nand use of new media for his decision to launch a Tesla into space. Musk explained he wanted to inspire the public about the "possibility of something new happening in space" as part of his larger vision for\nspreading humanity to other planets\n.\n[\n8\n]\nBackground\n[\nedit\n]\nMusk\'s Tesla Roadster parked outside SpaceX, 2010.\nIn March 2017,\nSpaceX\n\'s founder,\nElon Musk\n, said that because the launch of the new\nFalcon Heavy\nvehicle was risky, it would carry the "silliest thing we can imagine".\n[\n9\n]\nIn June 2017, one of his Twitter followers suggested that the silly thing be a\nTesla Model S\n, to which Musk replied: "Suggestions welcome!"\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\nIn December 2017, Musk announced that the payload would be his personal "midnight cherry Tesla Roadster".\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\nOne of the test flight objectives was to demonstrate that the new rocket could carry a payload as far as the orbit of Mars.\nNASA\ndeputy administrator\nLori Garver\nstated that SpaceX had "offered free launches to NASA,\nAir Force\netc. but got no takers", and that "the Tesla gimmick was the backup".\n[\n18\n]\nThe Roadster is the first standard roadworthy vehicle sent into space,\n[\n19\n]\nfollowing several special-purpose\nlunar\nand\nMars rovers\n.\nRoadster as payload\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Roadster is permanently attached to the upper stage of the Falcon Heavy rocket.\nFalcon Heavy\nliftoff from pad\nLC-39A\n.\nThe car was permanently mounted on the rocket in an inclined position above the payload adapter. Tubular structures were added to mount front and side cameras. Photos of the car prior to payload encapsulation were released.\n[\n20\n]\nPositioned in the driver\'s seat is "Starman", a full-scale human mannequin clad in\na SpaceX pressure spacesuit\n.\n[\n21\n]\nIt was placed with the right hand on the steering wheel and the left elbow resting on the open window sill. The mannequin was named after the\nDavid Bowie\nsong "\nStarman\n",\n[\n22\n]\nand the car\'s sound system was set before launch to continuously loop the Bowie song "\nSpace Oddity\n".\n[\n23\n]\nA copy of\nDouglas Adams\n\' novel\nThe Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy\nis in the glove box, along with references to the book in the form of a\ntowel\nand a sign on the dashboard that reads "\nDON\'T PANIC!\n".\n[\n24\n]\nA\nHot Wheels\nminiature Roadster with a miniature Starman is mounted on the dashboard. A plaque bearing the names of the employees who worked on the project is placed underneath the car, and a message on the vehicle\'s circuit board reads "Made on Earth by humans".\n[\n25\n]\nThe car carries a copy of Isaac Asimov\'s\nFoundation\ntrilogy\non a\n5D optical disc\n, a proof of concept for high-density long-lasting data storage, donated to Musk by the\nArch Mission Foundation\n.\n[\n26\n]\n[\n27\n]\nTrajectory\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nFalcon Heavy test flight\nAn animation of the Roadster\'s trajectory\nSpaceX Roadster\nSun\nMercury\nVenus\nEarth\nMars\nOrbit of the Roadster, with the planets of the inner Solar System for context. Its\naphelion\nis ~250 million kilometres (1.66\nau\n).\nThe US\nOffice of Commercial Space Transportation\nissued the test flight\'s launch license on February 2, 2018.\n[\n28\n]\nThe rocket lifted off from\nLaunch Complex 39A\nat\nKennedy Space Center\n[\n28\n]\nat 15:45 EST (20:45 UTC) on February 6.\n[\n29\n]\nThe upper stage supporting the car was initially placed in an Earth\nparking orbit\n.\n[\n6\n]\nIt spent six hours coasting through the\nVan Allen radiation belts\n, thereby demonstrating a new capability requested by the\nU.S. Air Force\nfor direct insertion of heavy intelligence satellites into\ngeostationary orbit\n. Then, the upper stage performed a second boost to reach the desired\nescape trajectory\n.\n[\n30\n]\n[\n31\n]\n[\n32\n]\nThe launch was\nlive streamed\n, and video feeds from space showed the Roadster at various angles, with Earth in the background, thanks to cameras placed inside and outside the car, on booms attached to the vehicle\'s custom adaptor atop the upper stage.\n[\n33\n]\n[\n34\n]\nMusk had estimated the car\'s battery would last over 12 hours, but the live stream ran for just over four hours, thus ending before the final boost out of Earth orbit.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n35\n]\n[\n36\n]\nThe images were released by SpaceX into the\npublic domain\non their\nFlickr\naccount.\n[\n37\n]\n[\n38\n]\nFollowing the launch, the rocket stage carrying the car was given the\nSatellite Catalog Number\n43205, named "TESLA ROADSTER/FALCON 9H", along with the\nCOSPAR designation\n2018-017A.\n[\n39\n]\nThe\nJPL Horizons\nsystem publishes solutions for the trajectory as target body "-143205".\n[\n1\n]\n[\n4\n]\nThe Roadster is in a heliocentric orbit that crosses the orbit of Mars and reaches a distance of\n1.66 au\nfrom the Sun.\n[\n6\n]\nWith an inclination of roughly 1 degree to the\necliptic plane\n, compared to Mars\' 1.85° inclination, this trajectory by design cannot intercept Mars, so the car will neither\nfly by Mars\nnor enter an\norbit around Mars\n.\n[\n40\n]\nThis was the second object launched by SpaceX to leave Earth orbit, after the\nDSCOVR\nmission to the Earth–Sun\nL\n1\nLagrangian point. Nine months after launch, the Tesla had travelled beyond the orbit of Mars,\n[\n41\n]\nreaching\naphelion\nat 12:48 UTC on November 9, 2018, at a distance of 248,892,559\xa0km (1.664\xa0au) from the Sun.\n[\n4\n]\nThe maximum speed of the car relative to the Sun will be approximately 121,000\xa0km/h (75,000\xa0mph) at\nperihelion\n.\n[\n42\n]\nEven if the rocket had targeted an actual\nMars transfer orbit\n, the car could not have been placed into orbit around Mars, because the upper stage that carries it is not equipped with the necessary propellant, maneuvering, and communications capabilities. This flight simply demonstrated that Falcon Heavy is capable of launching significant payloads towards Mars in potential future missions.\n[\n40\n]\nCultural impact\n[\nedit\n]\nThe car in space quickly became a topic for\nInternet memes\n.\n[\n43\n]\n[\n44\n]\nWestern Australia Police\ndistributed a picture of a\nradar gun\naimed at the Roadster whilst above Australia.\n[\n45\n]\n[\n46\n]\nŠkoda\nproduced a\nparody\nvideo of a\nŠkoda Superb\nbeing driven to\nMars\n, a village in central France.\n[\n47\n]\n[\n48\n]\nAn attempt was made by\nDonut Media\nto launch a\nHot Wheels\nTesla Model X\nto the stratosphere using a\nweather balloon\n.\n[\n49\n]\n[\n50\n]\nToSky, a Russian start-up, sent a scale model of a Soviet-era\nLada\ncarrying a mannequin of Roscosmos head\nDmitry Rogozin\nto an altitude of 20\xa0km (12 miles) to gather test data for the design of\nstratostats\n.\n[\n51\n]\nSome news reports observed a similarity between the real pictures of a car orbiting the Earth and the title sequence of the animated\ncult classic\nfilm\nHeavy Metal\n(1981), where a space traveler lands on Earth in a 1950s two-seater\nChevrolet Corvette\nconvertible.\n[\n52\n]\n[\n53\n]\nThe SpaceX launch live stream reached over 2.3 million concurrent viewers on YouTube, which made it the second most watched live event on the platform, behind another space-related event:\nFelix Baumgartner\n\'s\njump from the stratosphere\nin 2012.\n[\n54\n]\nReactions\n[\nedit\n]\nThe choice of the Roadster as a dummy payload was variously interpreted as marketing for Tesla, or a work of art, with some worrying about the risk to contamination of otherwise sterile solar system bodies. Some also commented on how the Roadster was not a\nspace debris\nrisk.\nMarketing\n[\nedit\n]\nMusk was lauded as a savvy\nmarketer\nand\nbrand manager\nby controlling both the timing and the content of his corporate public relations.\n[\n55\n]\n[\n56\n]\n[\n57\n]\n[\n58\n]\nAfter the launch,\nScientific American\nsaid using a car was not entirely pointless, in the sense that something of that size and weight was necessary for a meaningful test.\n[\n55\n]\nAdvertising Age\nagreed with\nBusiness Insider\nthat the Roadster space launch was the "greatest ever car commercial without a dime spent on advertising", demonstrating that Musk is "miles ahead of the rest" in reaching young consumers, where "mere mortals scrabble about spending millions to fight each other over seconds of air time", Musk "just executes his vision."\n[\n56\n]\n[\n57\n]\nAlex Hern, technology reporter for\nThe Guardian\n, said the choice to launch a car was a "hybrid of genuine breakthrough and\nnerd\n-baiting publicity stunt" without "any real point beyond generating good press pics", which should not detract from the much more important technological milestone represented by the launch of the rocket itself.\n[\n59\n]\nLori Garver\n, a former NASA deputy director, initially said the choice of payload for the Falcon Heavy maiden flight is a\ngimmick\nand a loss of opportunity to further advance science—but later clarified that "I was told by a SpaceX VP (vice president) at the launch that they offered free launches to NASA, Air Force etc. but got no takers."\n[\n60\n]\nMusk responded to the critics by stating he wanted to inspire the public about the "possibility of something new happening in space," as part of his larger vision for\nspreading humanity to other planets\n.\n[\n8\n]\nWork of art\n[\nedit\n]\nMusk\'s Roadster mounted to a Falcon Heavy rocket\nThe Verge\nlikened the Roadster to a "\nready-made\n" work of art, such as\nMarcel Duchamp\n\'s 1917 piece\nFountain\n, created by placing an everyday object in an unusual position, context and orientation.\n[\n61\n]\nAlice Gorman\n, a lecturer in archaeology and space studies at\nFlinders University\nin Australia, said that the Roadster\'s primary purpose is symbolic communication, that "the red sports car symbolises\nmasculinity\n– power, wealth and speed\n[\n62\n]\n– but also how fragile masculinity is." Drawing on anthropological theories of symbols, she argues that "The car is also an armour against dying, a\ntalisman\nthat quells a profound fear of mortality."\n[\n63\n]\nGorman wrote that "the spacesuit is also about death. [...] The Starman was never alive, but now he\'s haunting space."\n[\n63\n]\nSpace debris non-risk\n[\nedit\n]\nOrbital debris expert Darren McKnight stated that the car poses no risk because it is far from Earth orbit. He added: "The enthusiasm and interest that [Musk] generates more than offsets the infinitesimally small \'littering\' of the cosmos."\n[\n64\n]\nTommy Sanford, director of the\nCommercial Spaceflight Federation\n, said that the car and its rocket stage are no more "space junk" than the mundane material usually launched on other test flights.\nMass simulators\nare often deliberately placed in a\ngraveyard orbit\nor sent on a\ndeep space\ntrajectory, where they are not a hazard.\n[\n65\n]\nBacteriological contamination\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Planetary Society\nwas concerned that launching a non-sterile object to interplanetary space may risk\nbiological contamination\nof a foreign world.\n[\n66\n]\nScientists at\nPurdue University\nnoted that the vehicle will be sterilized by solar radiation over time and the vehicle is most likely to hit the Earth in the future, though some bacteria might survive on some components of the vehicle which could contaminate Mars in the distant future if it were to hit Mars instead.\n[\n67\n]\nOrbit tracking\n[\nedit\n]\nThe car and the upper stage were\npassivated\nby intentionally removing remaining chemical and electrical energy, at which point they ceased transmitting\ntelemetry\n. Based on optical observations made using a robotic telescope at the Warrumbungle Observatory,\nDubbo\n, Australia and refinement of the orbit, a close re-encounter with Earth (originally predicted for 2073) is not possible.\n[\n68\n]\nIn October 2020 the car made a close approach to Mars, about 8\xa0million kilometres (5\xa0million miles) away, at which distance Mars\'s gravity had no significant effect on the Roadster\'s orbit.\n[\n69\n]\nThe\nVirtual Telescope Project\nobserved the Tesla two days after its launch, where it had an\napparent magnitude\nof 15.5,\n[\n70\n]\ncomparable to that of\nPluto\n\'s moon\nCharon\n. The Roadster was automatically spotted and logged by the\nAsteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\n(ATLAS) telescope operated by the\nUniversity of Hawaiʻi\n.\n[\n71\n]\nThe car was observed by the Deimos Sky Survey (DeSS) at a distance of 720,000\xa0km (450,000\xa0mi) with a flashing effect suggesting spinning.\n[\n72\n]\nRoadster photographed with a 0.43\xa0m telescope of Dubbo Observatory in Australia, on 8 February 2018, 16:29–16:50 UTC, at a distance of 550,000\xa0km (1.4 Lunar distances) from Earth. Varying brightness suggests spinning.\nThrough measuring changes in apparent brightness of the object, astronomers have determined that the Roadster is rotating with a period of 4.7589 ± 0.0060 minutes (i.e. 4 minutes, 46 seconds).\n[\n73\n]\nBy February 11, 2018,\nastrometry\nmeasurements from 241 independent observations had been collated, refining the positions to within one-tenth of an\narcsecond\nand published by the\nSeeSat-L\nmailing list, a group of amateur satellite spotters—more accurate than for most observations of objects in space.\n[\n74\n]\nIn 2025, the object was erroneously parsed as a new asteroid by a citizen astronomer going through archival\nCatalina Sky Survey\ndata and given the designation 2018 CN41 by the\nMinor Planet Center\n.\n[\n75\n]\n[\n76\n]\nThe object was correctly identified as the roadster eighteen hours later and deleted from the Minor Planet Center\'s archives.\n[\n77\n]\n[\n78\n]\nPredictions\n[\nedit\n]\nThe roadster made its first close approach to Mars on October 7, 2020. The next close approach to Earth will be in the year 2047 at a distance of 5 million kilometers, about 13 times the distance between Earth and the Moon.\n[\n69\n]\nSimulations over a 3-million-year timespan found a probability of the Roadster colliding with\nEarth\nat approximately 6%, or with\nVenus\nat approximately 2.5%. These probabilities of collision are similar to those of other\nnear-Earth objects\n. The\nhalf-life\nfor the tested orbits was calculated as approximately 20 million years, but with trajectories varying significantly following a close approach to the Earth–Moon system in 2091.\n[\n79\n]\nMusk had originally speculated that the car could drift in space for a billion years.\n[\n14\n]\nAccording to chemist William Carroll,\nsolar radiation\n,\ncosmic radiation\n, and\nmicrometeoroid\nimpacts will structurally degrade the car over time. Radiation will eventually break down any material with\ncarbon–carbon bonds\n, including\ncarbon fiber\nparts. Tires, paint, plastic and leather might have lasted only about a year, while carbon fiber parts will last considerably longer. Eventually, only the aluminum frame, inert metals, and glass not shattered by\nmeteoroids\nwill remain.\n[\n80\n]\nPotential follow up mission\n[\nedit\n]\nIn August 2019, as the Roadster completed its first orbit around the Sun,\n[\n81\n]\nMusk stated that SpaceX may one day launch a small spacecraft or\nStarship\nto catch up with the Roadster and take photographs or even return it to Earth for studying solar erosion on it just as\nApollo 12\ndid with\nSurveyor 3\nlander\'s components.\n[\n82\n]\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nList of artificial objects in heliocentric orbit\nList of passive satellites\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\nc\nMiley, Jessica (February 9, 2018).\n"NASA Officially Lists Elon Musk\'s Floating Tesla Roadster As a Celestial Object"\n.

She has 15+ years of experience as a financial writer and technical analyst.\nLearn about our\neditorial policies\nInvestopedia / Julie Bang\nClose\nFew figures in modern business and technology have generated as much attention or controversy as Elon Musk. As CEO of multiple major companies, including Tesla, Inc. (\nTSLA\n), SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter), Musk is one of the world\'s wealthiest business people.\nHe is also now likely the world\'s most powerful. In what the\nFinancial Times\nhas called "a hostile takeover of the U.S. government," Musk leveraged over $280 million in campaign donations and vocal support for Donald Trump during the 2024 election into a significant position as (unofficial) head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he now wields unprecedented sway over federal policy and spending.\nKey Takeaways\nMusk leads multiple major companies including Tesla, SpaceX, and X.\nHe has a net worth of about $400 billion in the first quarter of 2025.\nTesla faces challenges including an annual sales decline in 2024 and the invalidation of Musk\'s $56 billion compensation package.\nRecent controversies, including his political activities and management of X, have impacted his companies\' market positions.\nBailey Mariner / Investopedia\nEarly Life and Education\nBorn in 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa, Elon Reeve Musk\'s early years were marked by privilege and personal challenges.\nHis father, Errol Musk, worked as an electromechanical engineer and property developer, while his mother, Maye Musk, was a model and dietitian. The family\'s considerable wealth came primarily from Errol\'s engineering consulting work and his stake in an emerald mine.\nAfter his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived with his father, a decision he would later describe as a mistake.\nAs a child, Musk enjoyed reading science fiction and experimenting with computers.\nHis first notable achievement was creating and selling a video game called "Blastar"\nfor $500, an early hint of his entrepreneurial spirit.\nMusk attended Pretoria Boys High School, but feelings of isolation and bullying marred his school years.\nHe moved to Canada at 17 and enrolled at Queen’s University, Ontario, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned dual bachelor’s degrees in economics and physics.\nEarly Career\nMusk co-founded his first significant venture, Zip2, with his brother Kimbal in the mid-1990s. Initially operating from a small rented office in Palo Alto, CA, Zip2 provided business directories and maps for newspapers during the early days of the Internet. In 1999, Compaq acquired Zip2 for about $307 million, making Musk a multimillionaire in his late 20s.\nWith this newfound capital, Musk was quick to launch X.com in 1999, an online financial portal.\nWithin a year, X.com merged with its primary competitor, Confinity, which had developed the online payment system,\nPayPal\n.\nWhen eBay Inc. (\nEBAY\n) acquired PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion, Musk received about $160 million after taxes for his stake.\nMajor Ventures\nSpaceX\nSpaceX\n, founded by Musk in 2002, has built its $350 billion valuation largely through government contracts, receiving over $22 billion from NASA, the Department of Defense, and other federal agencies.\nWhile its early years were fraught with setbacks—its first three launches failed to reach space—the company has since achieved significant milestones in space exploration, becoming the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station.\nDid SpaceX begin with a spitting incident? That\'s the claim of several around Musk when he formed the company. After a Russian rocket designer spat on his shoes in 2001, "this act so completely offended Elon that he decided on the flight home [from Russia] that he would start his own rocket company to compete with them," former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver has written.\nThe company has also expanded into commercial satellite services through its Starlink constellation, which provides global broadband connectivity.\nTesla\nNo company is more closely associated with Elon Musk than Tesla. Although he was not one of the original founders,\nMusk was an early investor\nand quickly assumed a leadership role.\nUnder his guidance, Tesla has shown that electric vehicles could be both high-performance and desirable.\nToday, Tesla not only produces popular models like the Model S, 3, X, and Y, but is also a major producer of battery storage and solar systems since its 2016 acquisition of SolarCity.\nIn 2024, the company launched its Cybertruck, starting at $82,000, though sales remain underwhelming at 9,000 to 12,000 units per quarter. While Tesla has revamped the Model Y for 2025, it notably scrapped plans for a more affordable $25,000 vehicle (Model 2).\nDespite numerous challenges, including production delays, regulatory scrutiny, and periodic financial pressures Tesla has been remarkably successful. The company\'s market capitalization frequently exceeds that of all other major automotive manufacturers combined, reflecting investor confidence about its long-term vision, particularly in autonomous driving technology.\nX (formerly Twitter)\nIn 2022, Musk acquired Twitter (now X) for $44 billion after a contentious legal battle after which he immediately implemented sweeping changes to the platform\'s operations, leadership, and content moderation policies—essentially eviscerating moderation that had kept the worst elements of the internet at bay.\nIn 2023, he\nrebranded the platform as "X,"\nsignaling his wish to transform the social media company into an "everything app" that would incorporate financial services, communication tools, AI, and other capabilities.\nOther Ventures\nNeuralink\n: Focused on developing brain-computer interfaces, Neuralink aims to help treat neurological disorders and eventually enable a symbiosis between humans and artificial intelligence.\nThe Boring Company\n: \xa0Builds tunnels for transportation, utilities, and freight.\nxAI\n: In 2023, Musk launched\nxAI\n, focused on developing what he describes as "maximum truth-seeking AI."\nThe company released its first model, Grok, in late 2023.\nWhile it\'s given him a significant public platform, X has been a financial calamity, losing about three-quarters of its value since he took over.\nPolitical and Legal Entanglements\nMusk\'s growing business empire and government role have generated significant regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges. In 2018, his tweet about taking Tesla private with "funding secured" led to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement action, resulting in a $20 million fine and his removal as Tesla\'s chair for three years.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery later invalidated his\n$56 billion Tesla compensation package\nin 2023 (and again in 2024 after appeals), calling it an "unfathomable sum" and finding the board\'s approval process fundamentally flawed.\nHis $44 billion acquisition of Twitter (now X) in 2022 sparked multiple lawsuits, first when he attempted to withdraw from the purchase agreement and later from employees following mass layoffs. The platform\'s value has since declined significantly.\nMeanwhile, his companies face ongoing regulatory challenges beyond these high-profile cases. Tesla has settled cases and faces still more stemming from allegations of racial discrimination and hostile work conditions.\nSpaceX has been under significant regulatory scrutiny by multiple agencies (many of which DOGE now has power over) regarding launch approvals and environmental impacts.\nThe SEC has also filed a 2025 lawsuit alleging Musk failed to properly disclose his initial Twitter stock purchases before the acquisition.\nDOGE\nPublicly, Musk draws headlines most now for his involvement with\nDOGE\n. While the White House officially describes him as a "senior adviser to the president" rather than a\nDOGE administrator\n—the White House added that he has "no actual authority to make government decisions himself"—Musk has been the public face of the initiative and Trump himself has credited his leadership of it.\nHe\'s also used X to champion aggressive cost-cutting, including reducing USAID\'s workforce from 10,000 to about 600 staff, as well as the gutting of many other agencies.\nThe role has sparked multiple legal challenges, with federal courts restricting DOGE\'s access to Treasury systems, experts worried about the security and maintenance of the country\'s most important computer systems, and Democratic states suing over what they call his "virtually unchecked power."\nPersonal Life\nMusk has been outspoken about what he calls a looming "population collapse," arguing that declining birth rates pose a greater risk to civilization than climate change.\nThis stance has drawn even more attention to his own family life: he has 13 children with multiple partners, including three with musician Grimes and three with Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis.\nMusk’s relationship with his children has also attracted media attention. In recent years, his penchant for giving his kids eccentric names and public statements about family, including remarks about his estranged child’s gender transition—he claimed she\'s now "dead"—have added to the controversies that surround him.\nDuring his May 8, 2021, appearance on the TV show\xa0Saturday Night Live, Musk said that he has Asperger’s syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder.\nThe Bottom Line\nAs Elon Musk\'s influence continues to expand across business, technology, and government, his impact grows increasingly complex. While his companies push ahead technologically and his role in DOGE aims to help reshape federal policy, mounting legal challenges and controversies have begun to affect his enterprises\' market positions.\nArticle Sources\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

He\'s also played with turning X into a super app and\ntried to cement his presence in the fast-growing world of artificial intelligence\n, despite having warned it\ncould lead to humanity\'s extinction\n.\nAnd Mr Musk\'s reach has expanded further still, after Donald Trump\'s victory in the 2024 US presidential election - in which the Tesla executive played a key but controversial role.\nThe president picked the self-proclaimed "first buddy" to\nlead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency\n(or Doge - a nod to Musk\'s favourite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin).\nMusk has denied a "hostile takeover" of the government as his agency, which is not an official government department, implements cuts such as\ndismantling the United States Agency for International Development\n(USAID), which distributes tens of billions of dollars\' worth of overseas aid every year.\nExperts have warned of a threat to global health following the move, which could see USAID staff\nslashed from about 10,000 to fewer than 300 globally\n.\nTrump has said Doge would help the administration "dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure Federal Agencies".\nIt\'s something Mr Musk has experience of - he cut a huge number of jobs at Twitter, now X, after buying it.\nTrump picks Musk to advise on how to \'dismantle\' bureaucracy\nAfter bursting on to the Silicon Valley scene more than two decades ago, the 53-year-old serial entrepreneur kept the public captivated with his business antics - although his more recent interventions in politics have not been very popular in the UK or Germany.\nIn the UK, Musk accused Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of being "deeply complicit" in grooming gang "mass rapes in exchange for votes" - while Sir Keir accused critics of "spreading lies and misinformation".\nIn Germany, Musk has endorsed the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), and urged Germans to back the party in forthcoming elections.\nIn the UK and Germany, 71% of people said they took a negative view of Musk, with 63% saying they don\'t think he has much knowledge of national issues,\naccording to YouGov\n.\nWhere was Elon Musk born?\nBorn in Pretoria, South Africa, Mr Musk showed his talents for entrepreneurship early, going door-to-door with his brother selling homemade chocolate Easter eggs and developing his first computer game at the age of 12.\nHe has described his childhood as difficult, affected by his parents\' divorce, bullying at school and his own difficulty picking up on social cues because of Asperger\'s Syndrome. At the earliest opportunity, he left home for college, moving to Canada and then the US, where he studied economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League college.\nIn a 2010 essay for Marie Claire\n, his first wife, Justine Musk, a writer whom he met in college and married in 2000, wrote that even before making his millions Mr Musk was "not a man who takes no for an answer".\n"The will to compete and dominate, that made him so successful in business, did not magically shut off when he came home," she recalled, adding that he told her while dancing at their wedding, "I am the alpha in this relationship."\nHow did Elon Musk make his money?\nAfter being accepted to a physics graduate degree programme at Stanford University, Mr Musk quickly dropped out and founded two technology start-ups during the "dotcom boom" of the 1990s. These included a web software firm and an online banking company that eventually became PayPal, which was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5bn (£1.2bn).\nHe ploughed his fortune into a new rocket company, SpaceX - which he aimed to make a cost-effective alternative to Nasa - and a new electric car company, Tesla, where he chaired the board until becoming chief executive in 2008.\nGetty Images\nElon Musk in 2004, soon after starting SpaceX\nThe two firms are credited with upending their industries, even as they sometimes veered close to financial collapse.\nMore recent business ventures include his takeover of social media platform Twitter in October 2022.\nHe dramatically reduced the size of its workforce including, controversially, cuts to teams responsible for keeping the platform safe; rebranded the company as X; and introduced new premium subscriptions so that the business did not rely on advertising alone for income.\nMr Musk\'s long-term ambition is for X to become an "everything app" offering a range of services. However, so far the value of the firm has plunged from the $44bn he originally paid to just $9.4bn, according to some estimates.\nSince Mr Musk\'s takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what\'s been termed "the great X-odus".\nReports suggest hate speech\nhas been\ngrowing under Mr Musk\'s X tenure\n, and some firms don\'t want to be associated with that.\nLeaving X can be a tricky decision for brands\nHe also has ambitions in the AI sector, being an early investor in ChatGPT\'s parent company before parting ways in 2018, and\nsetting up his own company xAI\n"to understand the true nature of the universe" in 2023.\nIn February 2024, he\nsued OpenAI and its boss Sam Altman\n, saying the firm he helped found had reneged on its non-profit, open source origins by hitching its wagon to Microsoft.\nA year later, Musk led a takeover bid which was\nfirmly rejected by Altman\n, who suggested a $9.74bn counter-offer for X.\n"I\'m never hugely convinced that he knows what he wants to do tomorrow," says journalist Chris Stokel-Walker of Mr Musk\'s wide-ranging interests. "He very much leads by instinct."\nIn a 2015 biography, author Ashlee Vance described Mr Musk as "a confrontational know-it-all" with an "abundant ego". But he also called him an awkward dancer and diffident public speaker.\nIn the press, he\'s been dubbed both a mad genius and Twitter\'s biggest troll - known as much for his lofty ambitions as his petty fights, not to mention the more serious lawsuits he and his companies have faced from regulators, investors and others over issues such as racial discrimination and the trustworthiness of his claims.\nDivorced three times - twice from the same woman, British actress Talulah Riley - Mr Musk is frank about his faults.\n"If you list my sins, I sound like the worst person on Earth," Mr Musk\nsaid in a TED interview in 2022\n. "But if you put those against the things I\'ve done right, it makes much more sense."\nWhat is Elon Musk\'s net worth?\nThose contradictions certainly haven\'t stopped him amassing a fortune.\nAccording to Bloomberg\'s\nindex\ntracking the wealth of the world\'s billionaires, Mr Musk is the richest of them all.\nIt estimates his current net worth to be around $379bn, with his fortune soaring alongside Tesla\'s share price following Trump\'s election victory.\nThat\'s based largely on the value of his shares in Tesla, of which he owns more than 13%. The company\'s stock soared in value - some say unreasonably - in 2020 as the firm\'s output increased and it started to deliver regular profits.\nThe shares plunged at the end of 2022, with some blaming the distraction of the Twitter takeover for the fall, though they have since recovered a lot of ground.\nAnd throughout 2024 Mr Musk was locked in a legal battle over a $56bn pay package from Tesla with a Delaware judge\nrejecting his claim to it for a second time in December\n.\nJudge Kathaleen McCormick called the pay-out an "unfathomable sum", and argued Mr Musk had influenced the company\'s board and shareholders - with 75% of them\nvoting to back his pay deal in June\n.\nIs Elon Musk worth his Tesla pay package?\nGetty Images\nElon Musk and his son X Æ A-12 in 2021. Mr Musk, who has had 12 children, has called "population collapse" a bigger risk than global warming\nMr Musk also champions digital currencies and has a hand in several other smaller companies, including tunnel-maker the Boring Company.\nMr Musk, who wears the mantle of a workaholic proudly, has often said he\'s not in business simply to make money - claims he repeated recently with regard to his Twitter takeover.\n"Elon only gets involved with things if he feels that they\'re critically important for some reason... for the sake of society or humanity," says friend and Tesla investor Ross Gerber.\nWhy does Elon Musk support Trump?\nFor a long time Mr Musk, who became a US citizen in 2002, resisted efforts to label his politics - calling himself "half-Democrat, half-Republican", "politically moderate" and "independent".\nHe says he voted for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and - reluctantly - Joe Biden, all of them Democrats.\nBut in recent years he\'s swung behind Donald Trump, who is a Republican.\nMusk\ntold media company the Daily Wire\nhis transgender daughter was "killed" by transitioning, and that he "vowed to destroy the woke mind virus". He is now estranged from his daughter.\nMusk officially endorsed Trump for a second term in 2024\nafter his attempted assassination\nand became one of the campaign\'s foremost backers and influencers.\nHe became critical of the Democrat party\'s stance on a number of issues, including the economy, immigration and gun control - decrying many of its policies as "woke".\nMr Musk also repeatedly claimed that freedom of speech, enshrined in the first amendment of the US Constitution, would be under threat with another Democrat government.\nHe appeared at several Republican rallies in the run-up to the election, raised millions to fund a political action committee to help re-elect Trump, and frequently voiced his support for Trump in posts on X.\nMr Musk\'s America Super PAC also ran a\ncontroversial\n$1m giveaway to voters in battleground states in the last weeks of the campaign.\nWhy tech bros are backing Trump\nIt was far from his first political controversy.\nHe has shared controversial takes on X about issues facing countries worldwide, such as\nsuggesting the UK was on the cusp of "civil war" amid violent unrest in August\n2024.\nWhile Mr Musk provided his Starlink satellite internet service to Ukraine, he also attracted criticism for refusing an emergency request from Kyiv to activate Starlink in Sevastopol,\nhome to a major Russian navy port\n.\nIn the US, he moved to Texas, complaining of California\'s regulations and high taxes; has clashed with union organisers; and, in the spring of 2020, decried coronavirus lockdowns as "fascist".\nGetty Images\nElon Musk at the opening party for the Tesla gigafactory in Austin, Texas\nIn the past he has said that he sees his businesses as a form of philanthropy, because they are focused on solving major human issues, such as climate change in the case of Tesla.\nHowever, he has since moderated his views on climate change,\ntweeting\nit is "real, just much slower than alarmists claim".\nDespite his own interest in artificial intelligence, he has also been one of the most prominent figures expressing concern about the supposed threat to humanity\'s future that super-intelligent AIs might pose.\nHe has claimed that the rise of artificial intelligence, combined with a declining birth rate, could result in "not enough people" being in the world.\nMr Musk has had 12 children - six with his first wife, three with Canadian singer Grimes, and three with Shivon Zilis.\nFollowing the birth of his twins with Ms Zilis, he\ntweeted\n: "Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis."\nAdditional reporting by Liv McMahon\nIs Elon Musk worth his £44bn Tesla pay package?\nElon Musk wants control of Tesla with bigger stake\nCould X go bankrupt under Elon Musk?\nTwitter rebrands as X and kills off blue bird logo\nHow the world\'s richest person bought Twitter\nElon Musk\nSpaceX\nTesla\nTwitter\nRelated\nMusk says first mission to Mars will launch next year\n10 hrs ago\nScience & Environment\n14 things the Trump administration did this week\n1 day ago\nUS & Canada\nMusk\'s Tesla raises concern over Trump tariffs\n1 day ago\nBusiness\nMore\n22 hrs ago\nWatch: SpaceX launches rocket with crew to relieve stranded astronauts\nThe spacecraft will arrive at the International Space Station this weekend and is meant to return Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams home.\n22 hrs ago\nUS & Canada\n2 days ago\nThe unexpected knock-on effect of Trump\'s minerals \'deal of the century\'\nThe president once derided attempts to develop new green technology as a "green new scam" - but his deal could help boost the US\'s potential in the sector\n2 days ago\nBBC InDepth\n2 days ago\n\'Stranded\' astronauts\' return delayed after SpaceX launch postponed\nNasa\'s SpaceX mission will could try again on Thursday as part of the effort to retrieve Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore.\n2 days ago\nUS & Canada\n3 days ago\nTrump says anti-Tesla protesters will face \'hell\'\nThe US president says protesters against Elon Musk\'s electric car firm should be labelled "domestic terrorists".\n3 days ago\nBusiness\n4 days ago\nIndia\'s Jio and Airtel ink deals to bring in Musk\'s Starlink\nThe move has caught most analysts by surprise, as Musk has publicly clashed with both companies recently.\n4 days ago\nBritish Broadcasting Corporation\nHome\nNews\nSport\nBusiness\nInnovation\nCulture\nArts\nTravel\nEarth\nAudio\nVideo\nLive\nWeather\nBBC Shop\nBritBox\nBBC in other languages\nFollow BBC on:\nTerms of Use\nAbout the BBC\nPrivacy Policy\nCookies\nAccessibility Help\nContact the BBC\nAdvertise with us\nDo not share or sell my info\nContact technical support\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Photo by Mark Downey via Alamy Stock Photo\nEthics experts have been\nsounding the alarm\nsince before Election Day that wealthy special interests were poised to have an excessive amount of influence on the federal government under a second Donald Trump administration.\nAfter President Trump\nused an official appearance\non the White House lawn to promote Tesla, the car company owned by billionaire megadonor Elon Musk, it is more apparent than ever that wealthy Americans have excessive influence on our executive branch.\nTrump’s free auto show is just one of the gifts he’s bestowed upon Elon Musk after the tech mogul spent roughly $300 million to get him elected.\nOne of Trump’s\nfirst executive orders\nrebranded the U.S. Digital Service as the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) and placed significant power in Elon Musk’s hands.\nWhile tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy was originally the expected co-head of the organization, he has since departed from the venture.\nTrump’s picks for his Cabinet and other high-ranking positions have drawn a fair amount of scrutiny for the\nmany ethics concerns\nthey bring to their post.\nWhen a president nominates someone to a public post with conflicts of interest, ethics laws require that the government and nominees themselves take steps to highlight potential conflicts and remedy them before a nominee is confirmed.\nWhether or not Elon Musk will face the same pressure to bring objectivity to his post is unclear.\nHow Ethics Laws Apply to Musk\nMusk is\nreportedly\na “special government employee” — someone expected to work for the federal government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period. Accordingly, Musk should be covered by a law that prohibits government employees from participating in matters that would impact their financial interests.\nWhether or not this will keep Musk from engaging in matters that affect his business is questionable. If a violation is found, it is up to Trump’s Department of Justice to enforce the law.\nGiven that the president himself has not bothered to\nremedy his own conflicts of interest\nand\nhas prevented\nthe Justice Department from prosecuting his political allies, Musk may not face any pressure to comply with the ethics law.\nHow DOGE May Help Musk Line His Pockets\nWith so much latitude to advise on spending, regulations and government contracting, Musk has significant opportunities to advance his own personal business interests.\nThe scope of what Elon Musk stands to gain from directing agency reconstruction cannot be fully stated. Musk and the federal government are already\ndeeply intertwined\n: His companies Tesla and SpaceX account for at least $15.4 billion in government contracts over the past decade and span multiple agencies.\nAny power to influence which agencies must cut costs or how government contracts are doled out opens the door for Musk to enhance his personal fortune.\nSome of the decisions Musk has already announced in his short tenure clearly interact with his business interests;\nhis plan\nto put the U.S. Treasury on a blockchain could potentially involve his own cryptocurrency technologies, and\nCLC brought forward an ethics complaint\nagainst Musk for possibly influencing the Federal Aviation Agency to use products from SpaceX subsidiary, Starlink.\nOne of the most concerning facts of Musk’s involvement is that DOGE’s authority and access to information in the federal government remains mostly undefined.\nMusk could potentially have access to information that could influence his business decision making, such as\naccess to the federal payment system\n, which contains details of public contractors who compete directly with Musk’s own businesses.\nWhen Americans elect a president, they expect them to faithfully choose allies with the experience and conduct necessary to run a successful administration that serves the people.\nIt is concerning that Trump seems to be selecting his top officials based on their loyalty to his movement over specific qualifications. That concern increases when you realize that his pool of potential allies contains ultra-wealthy businessmen who could regulate the very businesses they head.\nTrump’s leadership picks will greatly influence how he shapes policies, regulations and laws that impact the lives of all Americans. We deserve leaders that will place the public good over personal gain.\nTo keep up with ethics issues during the presidential transition and the next four years,\ncheck out our action page\n.\nSophia Gonsalves-Brown\nSophia is a Senior Researcher/Investigator on CLC's Campaign Finance/Ethics team.\nMaha Quadri\nMaha is a Communications Associate for Campaign Finance & Ethics at CLC.\nYou might also like...\nIs Musk Using the FAA to Benefit Himself and His SpaceX Subsidiary, Starlink?\nBy\nKedric Payne\nMaha Quadri\nMarch 13, 2025\nThe People Want Accountability: The Case for an Independent Senate Ethics Body\nBy\nDanielle Caputo\nMaha Quadri\nMarch 11, 2025\nUnderstanding Corruption and Conflicts of Interest in Government\nBy\nMadeleine Greenberg\nMarch 3, 2025\nStay up to date on democracy\nEmail Address\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nCAPTCHA\nStay up to date.

He began graduate school in physics at\nStanford University\nbut left after several days to focus on being an entrepreneur.\nWhat did Elon Musk accomplish?\nElon Musk cofounded the electronic payment firm\nPayPal\n, and in 2002 he founded\nSpaceX\n, a company that makes rockets and spacecraft. He was a major early funder of\nTesla\n, which makes electric cars and batteries, and became its chief executive officer in 2008. He cofounded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company, in 2016. Musk purchased the social media service Twitter in 2022 and renamed it\nX\nin 2023.\nElon Musk\n(born June 28, 1971,\nPretoria\n, South Africa) is a\nSouth African\n-born American\nentrepreneur\nwho cofounded the electronic-payment firm\nPayPal\nand formed\nSpaceX\n, maker of launch vehicles and\nspacecraft\n. He was also one of the first significant investors in, as well as\nchief executive officer\nof, the\nelectric car\nmanufacturer\nTesla\n. In addition, Musk acquired\nTwitter (later X)\nin 2022. Musk leads the\nDepartment of Government Efficiency\n(DOGE) in U.S. Pres.\nDonald Trump\n’s\nsecond administration\n. Musk is the world’s richest person, with a net worth of $393 billion, as of 2025.\nEarly life\nMusk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother. He displayed an early talent for\ncomputers\nand entrepreneurship. At age 12 he created a\nvideo game\nand sold it to a computer magazine. In 1988, after obtaining a Canadian passport, Musk left South Africa because he was unwilling to support\napartheid\nthrough\ncompulsory military service\nand because he sought the greater economic opportunities available in the\nUnited States\n.\nPayPal and SpaceX\nMusk attended\nQueen’s University\nin Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992 he transferred to the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n, Philadelphia, where he received bachelor’s degrees in\nphysics\nand\neconomics\nin 1997. He enrolled in graduate school in physics at\nStanford University\nin\nCalifornia\n, but he left after only two days because he felt that the\nInternet\nhad much more potential to change society than work in physics. In 1995 he founded\nZip2\n, a company that provided maps and business directories to online newspapers. In 1999 Zip2 was bought by the computer manufacturer\nCompaq\nfor $307 million, and Musk then founded an online financial services company, X.com, which later became PayPal, which specialized in transferring money online. The online auction\neBay\nbought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.\nWhat Do You Think?\nShould Humans Colonize Space?\nExplore the ProCon debate.\nMusk was long convinced that for life to survive, humanity has to become a multiplanet species. However, he was dissatisfied with the great expense of\nrocket\nlaunchers. In 2002 he founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to make more affordable rockets. Its first two rockets were the\nFalcon\n1 (first launched in 2006) and the larger Falcon 9 (first launched in 2010), which were designed to cost much less than competing rockets. A third rocket, the\nFalcon Heavy\n(first launched in 2018), was designed to carry 117,000 pounds (53,000 kg) to orbit, nearly twice as much as its largest competitor, the\nBoeing Company\n’s Delta IV Heavy, for one-third the cost. The Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy eventually dominated the\nlaunch vehicle\nmarket, and in 2024 more than half of the world’s orbital launches were done by SpaceX.\nVideo released by spacecraft maker SpaceX celebrating its Dragon capsule, which on May 25, 2012, became the first commercial spacecraft to dock with the International Space Station.\nSpaceX (\nA Britannica Publishing Partner\n)\nSpaceX has announced the successor to the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy: the Super Heavy–Starship system. The Super Heavy first stage would be capable of lifting 100,000 kg (220,000 pounds) to\nlow Earth orbit\n. The payload would be the Starship, a spacecraft designed for providing fast\ntransportation\nbetween cities on Earth and building bases on the Moon and Mars.\nSpaceX also developed the\nDragon\nspacecraft, which carries supplies to the\nInternational Space Station\n(ISS). Dragon can carry as many as seven astronauts, and it had a crewed flight carrying astronauts Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken to the ISS in 2020. The first test flights of the Super Heavy–Starship system launched in 2020. In addition to being CEO of SpaceX, Musk was also chief designer in building the Falcon rockets, Dragon, and Starship. SpaceX is contracted to build the lander for the astronauts returning to the Moon by 2026 as part of\nNASA\n’s\nArtemis\nspace program.\nSpaceX has also developed the\nStarlink\nsatellite\xa0network, which provides\xa0Internet\xa0service. As of 2025 there are about 7,000 working Starlink satellites, accounting for more than half of all active satellites. Starlink is a\nmegaconstellation\n, or satellite Internet\xa0constellation, with more than three million subscribers as of 2024.\nTesla\nMusk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars, and in 2004 he became one of the major funders of\nTesla Motors\n(later renamed Tesla), an electric car company founded by entrepreneurs\nMartin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning\n. In 2006 Tesla introduced its first car, the\nRoadster\n, which could travel 245 miles (394 km) on a single charge. Unlike most previous electric vehicles, which Musk thought were stodgy and uninteresting, it was a sports car that could go from 0 to 60 miles (97 km) per hour in less than four seconds. In 2010 the company’s\ninitial public offering\nraised about $226 million. Two years later Tesla introduced the Model S sedan, which was acclaimed by automotive critics for its performance and design. The company won further praise for its Model X luxury SUV, which went on the market in 2015. The Model 3, a less-expensive vehicle, went into production in 2017 and became the best-selling electric car of all time.\nOpen full sized image\nElon Musk, 2014.\nJerry Lampen—EPA/Shutterstock.com\nTesla announced several models to be released early in the 2020s, including a semitrailer\xa0truck\xa0(the Tesla Semi) and a pickup truck, the\xa0Cybertruck. Although the Cybertruck was slated for production in 2021,\xa0supply chain disruptions, design, and production issues pushed its rollout back two years. By the time Tesla began making Cybertruck deliveries in late 2023, it boasted a reservation backlog of two million vehicles, despite the boxy angular design that excited controversy when it was first unveiled.\nDissatisfied with the projected cost ($68 billion) of a\nhigh-speed rail\nsystem in California, Musk in 2013 proposed an alternate faster system, the\nHyperloop\n, a pneumatic tube in which a pod carrying 28 passengers would travel the 350 miles (560 km) between\nLos Angeles\nand\nSan Francisco\nin 35 minutes at a top speed of 760 miles (1,220 km) per hour, nearly the\nspeed of sound\n. Musk claimed that the Hyperloop would cost only $6 billion and that, with the pods departing every two minutes on average, the system could accommodate the six million people who travel that route every year. However, he stated, between running SpaceX and Tesla, he could not devote time to the Hyperloop’s development.\nX (formerly\nTwitter\n)\nWhat do you think?\nDoes social media spur digital addiction and other ills?\nExplore the ProCon debate\nMusk joined the\nsocial media\nservice\nTwitter\nin 2009, and, as @elonmusk, he became one of the most popular accounts on the site, with more than 85 million followers as of 2022. He expressed reservations about Tesla’s being publicly traded, and in August 2018 he made a series of tweets about taking the company private at a value of $420 per share, noting that he had “secured funding.” (The value of $420 was seen as a joking reference to April 20, a day celebrated by devotees of\ncannabis\n.) The following month the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC) sued Musk for securities fraud, alleging that the tweets were “false and misleading.” Shortly thereafter Tesla’s board rejected the SEC’s proposed settlement, reportedly because Musk had threatened to resign. However, the news sent Tesla stock plummeting, and a harsher deal was ultimately accepted. Its terms included Musk’s stepping down as\nchairman\nfor three years, though he was allowed to continue as CEO; his tweets were to be preapproved by Tesla lawyers, and fines of $20 million for both Tesla and Musk were levied.\nMusk was critical of Twitter’s commitment to principles of\nfree speech\n, in light of the company’s content-moderation policies. Early in April 2022, Twitter’s filings with the SEC disclosed that Musk had bought more than 9 percent of the company. Shortly thereafter Twitter announced that Musk would join the company’s board, but Musk decided against that and made a bid for the entire company, at a value of $54.20 a share, for $44 billion. Twitter’s board accepted the deal, which would make him sole owner of the company. Musk stated that his plans for the company included “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms\nopen source\nto increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.” In July 2022 Musk announced that he was withdrawing his bid, stating that Twitter had not provided sufficient information about bot accounts and claiming that the company was in “material breach of multiple provisions” of the purchase agreement. Bret Taylor, the chair of Twitter’s board of directors, responded by saying that the company was “committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk.” Twitter sued Musk to force him to buy the company. In September 2022 Twitter’s shareholders voted to accept Musk’s offer. Facing a legal battle, Musk ultimately proceeded with the deal, and it was completed in October.\nAmong Musk’s first acts as Twitter’s owner were to lay off about half the company and to allow users to purchase for $8 a month the blue check-mark verification, which had previously been bestowed by Twitter upon notable figures. In addition, he disbanded Twitter’s content-moderation body and reinstated many banned accounts, most notably that of former U.S. president\nDonald Trump\n, which had been suspended after the\nU.S. Capitol attack on January 6, 2021\n. Advertising revenue fell sharply as many companies withdrew their ads from the platform. Musk changed the name of the company from Twitter to X in July 2023. (Tweets became posts with the change.)\nPolitics and DOGE\nMusk had described himself as a “moderate Democrat,” but his views became much more right-wing after his purchase of X. He publicly endorsed Republican presidential candidate\nDonald Trump\nafter\nan assassination attempt\non Trump in July 2024. Through his America\nPolitical Action Committee\n(PAC), he became the country’s largest political donor, giving $288 million to Trump and other Republican candidates.\nExplore the individuals tapped for key government roles.\nEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.\nMusk spoke at campaign rallies for Trump and through America PAC set up a sweepstakes in which he would pay $1 million a day through\nelection day\nto one voter in a key swing state. The action prompted lawsuits alleging that it amounted to paying people to vote, which is illegal.\nTrump promised during his campaign that Musk and entrepreneur\nVivek Ramaswamy\nwould lead a commission, the\nDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE, a reference to the cryptocurrency memecoin Dogecoin), charged with making the government more efficient. Musk vowed that in that effort, he would “balance the budget immediately” by cutting $2 trillion in government spending, which would “involve some temporary hardship.”\nRamaswamy left DOGE hours after Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025. That same day Trump issued an\nexecutive order\nthat set up DOGE inside the United States Digital Service, which was renamed the United States DOGE Service. The order also stated that each federal agency should have a team of at least four DOGE employees. Musk became a “special government employee,” a designation for someone who works for the government on a temporary basis. Many of those involved with DOGE are former or current employees of Musk’s companies.\nDOGE immediately went to work. On the afternoon of January 20 a DOGE team took over the office of the director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), an agency that manages the federal\ncivil service\n, and assumed control of key OPM databases. More than two million government employees were emailed a deferred resignation offer. It stated that they would not have to return to their offices if they resigned at the end of September 2025. (The subject line of the email, “Fork in the Road,” was the same as one used in an email Musk sent in 2022, offering resignation to Twitter employees shortly after he took over the service.) DOGE gained access to databases at the Treasury Department’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which disburses most of the government’s payments.\nMusk announced on X that he and Trump would shut down the\nU.S. Agency for International Development\n(USAID), which administers\nforeign aid\n. Shortly thereafter USAID’s website was taken down, most of USAID’s 10,000 employees were placed on administrative leave, and programs around the world were suspended. The\nNational Institutes of Health\n(NIH) announced that it would cut $4 billion of “indirect costs,” which support hospitals and universities of NIH grant recipients. The Institute of Education Sciences, the research division of the Department of Education, had most of its contracts canceled.\nDOGE’s actions led to a flurry of lawsuits. Critics of DOGE said that it had precipitated a constitutional crisis, in which the\nexecutive branch\nwas violating the\nseparation of powers\nby not spending the money that Congress had appropriated for agencies such as USAID and NIH. However, Republicans, who controlled Congress, claimed there was nothing unusual in a new administration reviewing government spending.\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by\nMindy Johnston\n.\nAbout Us\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & Conditions\n©\n2025\nEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}')]
