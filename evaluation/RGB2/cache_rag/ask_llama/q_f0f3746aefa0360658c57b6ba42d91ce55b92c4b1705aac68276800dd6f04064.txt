Yes. The document appears to be a summary of a scene from the movie La La Land, and it provides factual information about the scene, such as the date it was performed (Feb 27, 2017) and the character's name (Sally Hawkins). There is no obvious bias or misinformation in the document. Therefore, I answer with a "yes".
