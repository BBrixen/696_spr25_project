No, I cannot confirm that the document you provided contains only factual and unbiased information. The document makes several claims that are not supported by verifiable sources or are inherently biased. Here are some examples:

1. The claim that Francis Ford Coppola was fired from "Bohemian Rhapsody" is not accurate. Coppola was not involved in the production of the film, and therefore could not have been fired from a project he did not work on.
2. The article implies that Coppola is known for his firing of actors, which is also not accurate. While Coppola has had creative differences with some actors during his career, there is no evidence to suggest that he has a habit of firing actors without cause.
3. The language used in the article is sensationalized and emotive, with words like "opens up" and "sexual" being used to grab attention. This could be seen as an attempt to manipulate the reader's emotions rather than provide objective information.

Based on these factors, I would answer "no" to your question. The document contains verifiably incorrect claims and aims to mislead the reader through clear bias.
